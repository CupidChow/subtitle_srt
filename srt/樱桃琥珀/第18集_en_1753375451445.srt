The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 2

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Xie Yuanyuan!

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xie Yuanyuan!

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why are you shouting?

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you ashamed, Lin Yitang?

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's really you!

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't recognize you at the first time

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
when you were over there.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't recognize you either.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're quite big.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Put it here.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why is your school's school lunch

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
even more delicious than that of the school's?

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're used to eating at this time?

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm used to it.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No matter if it's our school's food,

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the whole Hongyang is full of delicious food.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm used to it.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When I first came here,

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
my teacher said that

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
the food map of Hongyang

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is just one sentence.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Take the 12-way bus to the subway station

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and find the airport express.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then buy a ticket at the airport in Hongyang

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and fly to Guangzhou directly.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Lin Yitang is also like that.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He doesn't take you out to eat something good.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If I want to eat something good,

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
why would I go to him?

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Besides,

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
their school's food is not as delicious as ours.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Eat slowly.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you notice that

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
they're all looking at you?

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Female celebrities.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why are you so unhappy with them?

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know if all of them

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
are female celebrities.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
None of them can be good.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You haven't said it yet.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You came to Hongyang so soon.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you going to enter the school with me?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Really?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's fake.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How can you be so famous?

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because...

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're looking at Yu Cheng?

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We're in college.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's all in the past.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then why are you here?

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I came to Hongyang with you

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to shop and buy clothes.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't come here to buy clothes.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I came to buy things for my online store.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Give me your bag.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, I can carry it myself.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's heavy.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't come here to give you a bag.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I came here to hold the bag

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and let the owner think

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm here to take the bag.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This way, I can see the space later.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And,

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
if I see that he can't see it,

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll give you a look and pull it away.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then he can tie me down.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If he doesn't talk to me,

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
don't worry.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I've been selling things for years.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have the experience.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You count ten.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He can't tie me down

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
within ten.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm here.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Is it okay?

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sister, I'll take ten.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thirty, okay?

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Little girl, I gave you a free ride.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Sister, I'm running an online store.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's just get to know each other.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If I do it again,

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll come to you to take the goods.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't be cheap

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
with a small business.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It seems to be a little expensive.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How about

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
going to someone else's house?

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It may be cheaper, right?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
six, five, four,

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
three, two, one.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sister,

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
how about we discuss it again?

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sister,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
can you give me a little more money?

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Our little girl has just started

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to do business.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Please.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Look at you.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're so beautiful.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're so kind, right?

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's hot today.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You two go buy two bottles of drinks.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Cheers.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is not a simple game.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is the fruit of our victory.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is also a reward for your hard work.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You'll have to help me

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
take this bag of clothes back later.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then I'll call Yu Qiao.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Lin Xingte,

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
don't be lazy.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not going to be lazy.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're here to promote,

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
so we should have a meal together.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't want to see him this time.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't plan to tell him either.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why?

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Did you two quarrel?

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Then why don't you want to see him?

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm in love.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're in love?

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When did you fall in love?

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Who did you talk to?

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A few months ago.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It was my classmate.

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He helped me a lot when I opened a online store.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then we naturally got together.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's nothing special.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have nothing to say,

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
so I didn't tell you.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What do you mean you have nothing to say?

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is your first time in love.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How special is that?

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You didn't tell me.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's so not interesting.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If I made a million,

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I would definitely tell you right away.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's the big deal.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's just a relationship.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not a big deal.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I have a male friend by my side.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a little special.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's it?

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Or how complicated it is?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Everyone's love is like this.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Only your love

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is a blind date.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can't find it.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why do you say that?

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Lin Yintang.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Who is Jiang Qiaoxi?

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why don't I have any impression on this name?

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is it your illusion?

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Qin Yeyun.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're right to say that.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're still the same as before.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're so bad.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're so bad.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What's wrong?

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Look.

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What did you say?

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yuqiao sent me a message.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Did he say anything to you?

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why are you so nervous?

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I asked because you looked bad.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He said he wanted to give me something.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But what he said was weird.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Lin Yintang, I have something for you.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're welcome.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Do you have time at five o'clock in the afternoon?

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
See you at the school gate.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Then you go.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not in a hurry.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll help you send the things back.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll be looking for him.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's the good of my clothes?

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll go back in a car.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're going back?

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I booked a small hotel near your school.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can come to me when you walk in.

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why did you book a hotel?

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can live with me at school.

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I told my senior sister.

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We'll live in the same bed.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
They used to be friends.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to talk to you tonight.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's convenient to talk.

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You really don't want to go back with me?

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Can you save money?

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Stop talking nonsense.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No.

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Go.

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll call you when I'm done.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
OK.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yuexiao.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing?

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're here in time.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The cake hasn't been painted yet.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You sent me a message just to give me a cake?

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think this cake is rabbit-shaped.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I just want to buy it for you.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You two are so strange today.

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We?

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Who am I with?

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Tell me the truth.

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Tell me.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Did something happen?

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Ying Tao.

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You...

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You were a blind man and saved money.

229
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How much did you save?

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I know.

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You want to borrow money from me.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I told you.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You want to see me and buy me a cake.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Do you want to borrow money from me?

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't want to.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You've been friends for so many years.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you have to be so heartless?

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not heartless.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm rational.

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Think about it.

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you need big money,

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you must find Aunt Zhang Ping.

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She won't lend me money.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you need small money,

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I also need small money.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have a lot of money.

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's right.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Your money is not the money of the world's air ticket.

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's very useful.

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Here.

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Take your cake.

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm leaving.

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yu Qing.

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you want to buy a thunderbolt sunglasses,

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you don't have to borrow money from me.

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll go to Hong Kong on my summer vacation.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll bring it to Hong Kong.

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's your birthday gift.

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're going to Hong Kong?

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you know where it is?

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But I have to try it.

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you know

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
what kind of sunglasses

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I want to buy?

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What kind of sunglasses?

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You talk about it every day.

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
How can I not know?

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The one on your poster

270
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
was worn by the pilot.

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then when I go out,

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll bring it to you.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You don't have to bring it to me.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You don't know what I like.

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Of course I know.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm going to Hong Kong.

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Snow.

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's heavy.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you need help?

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, thank you.

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What's that on your hand?

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It smells good.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you.

284
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hello.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What can I do for you?

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Is there a rabbit cake left?

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There's only one left.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay, then wrap it up for me.

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you.

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Actress Jin.

292
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Actress Jin.

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I heard it.

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Don't be afraid.

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go in.

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're going to graduate in two years.

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What two years?

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why are you so natural?

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you...

300
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why?

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you thinking?

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's not over yet.

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's good.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't, don't, don't.

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's hot.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm telling you.

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If you...

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
tell me again.

309
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't tell you like you're in love.

310
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If I'm not by your side,

311
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you can call me as soon as possible.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay.

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Then you have to tell me.

314
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Call me wherever you are.

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Be careful.

316
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Make a wish.

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Cheers.

318
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Come on.

319
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Take a piece of cake.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No.

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
There are so many cake shops in Hongyang.

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So many cakes.

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You two bought the same thing.

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll eat it and you buy it.

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He came to you

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
just to give you a cake.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He said that.

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But I think he's a little shy today.

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I thought he was going to ask me for money.

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He's running away.

331
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No.

332
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Lin Yitang, don't worry about me.

333
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I already have a boyfriend.

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you think I'm the kind of person who can walk on two feet?

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Of course not.

336
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You are the most upright and kind person.

337
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Look at him.

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Lin Yitang,

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
have you ever thought about your own future?

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My future?

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
For you?

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
My future

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is to be an ideal, ambitious

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and a person who has a contribution to society.

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What's wrong?

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why are you wearing this?

347
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Whether I open a online store

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
or go out to buy goods,

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
there are many children

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
who are not able to go to school.

351
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm not going to be a good person.

352
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sometimes I can't go on.

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Every time I think about it,

354
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
if I have a daughter in the future,

355
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
what kind of mother would she want me to be?

356
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She must want me to be rich and strong.

357
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So every time I can't go on,

358
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I will think

359
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
that I want to be someone who can teach my future daughter.

360
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can hold on to anything now.

361
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Lin Yitang,

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
is Jiang Qiaoxi

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
the future you imagine?

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Is Jiang Qiaoxi

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
who will not tell you

366
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
no matter what happens

367
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and will only leave

368
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
a beautiful lie

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and disappear suddenly?

370
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Can't it be Yuqiao?

371
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What are you talking about?

372
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've been by your side all the time.

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I can see it very clearly.

374
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You only learned to play the guitar

375
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
after you met Jiang Qiaoxi.

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm not as good as you think.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Sometimes I think

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
that it would be great if I didn't like Jiang Qiaoxi.

380
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If I like someone else.

381
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But I can only think of this.

382
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Because in the future I imagine,

383
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't imagine

384
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
a future without Jiang Qiaoxi.

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I told you.

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Sometimes I think

387
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that she is me.

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I am her.

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So when I look for her,

390
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
it seems that

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm looking for myself.

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Liu Yintang,

393
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
you're not like her.

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
She is so selfish.

395
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
She kept you here for two years.

396
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There is no news at all.

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You can't even count as a boyfriend and girlfriend.

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But every time

399
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I think of the words she said on the night she left,

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
her expression,

401
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
her eyes,

402
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I think I can feel it.

403
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If I'm feeling very sad now,

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
ten points, one hundred points,

405
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I think she's sad

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
maybe one thousand, one million points.

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But

408
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I need to know

409
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
what happened to her

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
when she just got her freedom.

411
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It has nothing to do with her.

412
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It has nothing to do with

413
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
us being boyfriend and girlfriend.

414
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's just that she is very important to me.

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Liu Yintang,

416
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
you're so stupid.

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not stupid.

418
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I have a daughter

419
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
more than you do.

420
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Jiang Chenluo.

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Have some cake.

422
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not hungry.

423
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm not hungry.

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's go.

425
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You really don't need me to send you?

426
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Can you handle it by yourself?

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't worry.

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I really don't need you to send me.

429
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then

430
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll go first.

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Then send me a message

432
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to tell me that you're safe.

433
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay.

434
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm going.

435
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Wait, Yintang.

436
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Do you regret it?

437
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Actually,

438
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Jiang Qiaoxi...

439
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What about Jiang Qiaoxi?

440
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
She's not a big brand.

441
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But she's pretty useful.

442
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You should learn how to do your makeup.

443
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't wait for Jiang Qiaoxi.

444
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You'll be too haggard.

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You gave me your cosmetics.

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Do you still need them?

447
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I bought them for you.

448
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm afraid you won't need them.

449
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay, okay.

450
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Put them on.

451
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'll go.

452
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll go.

453
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll go.

454
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'll go.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll go.

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll go.

457
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll put them in my bag.

458
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's okay.

459
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Let's go.

460
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Thank you.

461
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You still want to thank me?

462
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You're so cute.

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Come visit me often.

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm going.

465
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Be careful.

466
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm going.

467
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

468
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The sun will rise

469
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and the girl will say goodbye

470
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Hey,

471
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
we meet again.

472
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm not your classmate.

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm not from your school.

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Then why are you in our school's basketball court?

475
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What?

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You charge for your school's basketball court?

477
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Are you here to ask for my ticket?

478
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Then you're here to find someone.

479
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Who are you looking for?

480
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Maybe I know you.

481
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
How many thousand people in your school?

482
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
How could you know?

483
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You're not here to find a boyfriend, are you?

484
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

485
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Really?

486
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Why should I lie to you?

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Really?

488
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That's good.

489
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I have someone I like.

490
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh, really?

491
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The person I like also likes to play basketball.

492
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Every time I passed by the basketball court,

493
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I would take a look to see if he was there.

494
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But I can only take a look.

495
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I won't stop.

496
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't want him to know I'm looking at him.

497
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Isn't it good for him to know?

498
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Most of the time,

499
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
we boys play basketball

500
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
to show to girls.

501
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
No.

502
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because the person I like

503
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
also has someone he likes.

504
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The person he likes is my good friend.

505
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Is your relationship so complicated?

506
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
There are more complicated people.

507
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There are more complicated people.

508
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The person my good friend likes suddenly disappeared.

509
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Actually,

510
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I know where he went.

511
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But I didn't tell him.

512
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You're taking revenge on him.

513
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
How could it be?

514
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That boy always makes my friend sad.

515
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't want him to be so sad anymore.

516
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I don't want my good friend

517
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
to be with the person I like.

518
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So I lied to my friend that I was in love.

519
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't want him to be sad for me anymore.

520
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
What about yourself?

521
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You've done so much for others.

522
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Don't you feel sad?

523
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Okay, I won't talk about it.

524
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm leaving. Bye.

525
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Beauty,

526
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
you're amazing

527
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for thinking for others.

528
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You're amazing.

529
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You have a golden heart.

530
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Thank you.

531
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm happy to hear that.

532
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Hello, I'm a friend of your tutor.

533
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
If it's convenient,

534
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
can you tell me your tutor's contact information?

535
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Is it possible?

536
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Qiao, I've taken the hair gel back.

537
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What's wrong with you?

538
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You think you're good again?

539
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Nothing.

540
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I met a beauty

541
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
who was trapped by love today.

542
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I don't know if the person she likes is blind.

543
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
She's so pretty.

544
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Why doesn't she like her?

545
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What does it have to do with

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
your hair gel?

547
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm thinking

548
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
if I can meet a beauty again,

549
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
can I also appear in public?

550
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I can show you my ID.

551
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
If you're still worried,

552
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
we can meet.

553
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Qiao, I'm right, right?

554
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You're dating a Hong Kong girl?

555
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes.

556
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
When I get off the Hong Kong-Ottawa tour,

557
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll go to Hong Kong to find her.

558
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Qiao, you can't do this.

559
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You can't do this.

560
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Aren't you afraid that

561
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
she'll cause you trouble?

562
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
She won't.

563
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
This is my ID.

564
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
This is my Hong Kong-Australia pass.

565
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
This is my graduation certificate

566
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
in the first year of my family.

567
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yes.

568
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Your teacher Jiang is also

569
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in school here.

570
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This is my college student ID.

571
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
North Air University,

572
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
the College of Flying.

573
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There's a stamp on it.

574
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It won't be fake.

575
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The College of Flying.

576
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Are you going to be a pilot in the future?

577
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes.

578
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
This school is very popular.

579
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.

580
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You've told me all these things

581
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
in MSN.

582
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But you still didn't tell me

583
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
why you came to find teacher Jiang.

584
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
She's my friend.

585
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
She's also the one I like.

586
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The one I like.

587
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So I have to know where she is.

588
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I know.

589
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You made me think about it.

590
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I know where teacher Jiang is.

591
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But my parents won't let me tell you.

592
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But I'll tell you.

593
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Thank you.

594
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm not touched by you.

595
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I just feel that

596
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
teacher Jiang is pretty handsome.

597
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But every time he comes to our class,

598
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
he doesn't look very happy.

599
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I think if he knows

600
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
that his friend is here to find him,

601
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
he'll be happier.

602
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What are you laughing at?

603
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm laughing.

604
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Jiang Chen is so lucky.

605
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
He has friends who care about him.

606
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I want to let you see

607
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
the light that shines in my heart

608
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I want to sing

609
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I want to sing for you

610
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
my loneliness and mystery

611
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I want to forget

612
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I want to forget

613
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the ordinary growth

614
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I want to forget

615
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the ordinary growth

616
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000

617
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000

618
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I want to forget

619
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the ordinary growth

620
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
in the clouds

621
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
in the distance

622
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I want to let you see

623
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the light that shines in my heart

624
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000

625
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000

I want to forget

628
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I want to forget

629
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the ordinary growth

630
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
in the clouds

631
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
in the distance

632
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000

633
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000

Not helping me.

724
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000

Why are you here?

726
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
To see Qiao Xi.

Yes.

729
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Let's play.

730
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
I'm not sure.

731
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
I'll go out and talk.

732
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Little friend, play with me.

733
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200

Okay.

744
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
We don't play with money.

745
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
You can eat now.

746
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Can I?

747
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Take the money.

748
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
It's okay.

749
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Okay.

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I'll give it to you.

760
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
I'll give it to you.

761
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Give it to me.

762
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I'll give it to you.

763
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Okay.

764
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
You're lucky today.

765
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Give it to me.

766
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
You got it.

767
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Bro, your friend is the same as you.

768
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
He's stealing chicken.

769
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I thought you had a full house

770
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
or a full house to call in.

771
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Bro, you were stealing chicken

772
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
and being like him.

773
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm not stealing chicken.

774
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
I am not good at playing this game.

775
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
You don't know how to play, you're a bad boy.

776
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Good job, good job.

777
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Come on, come on, come on.

778
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Turn around first.

779
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
What turn around first?

780
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Come on, come on, come on.

781
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
You have friends.

782
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
You listen to me.

783
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Come on, come on.

784
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Which way, which way?

785
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Which way? Come on.

786
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
How did you find me?

787
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
The girl in your home town

788
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
took a picture of you

789
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
and pulled out the post.

790
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I saw it.

791
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Does Yin Tao know?

792
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
If Yin Tao knew,

793
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
would I still be the one who appeared here?

794
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
I don't know.

795
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
I don't know.

796
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
I don't know.

797
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
You,

798
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
disappeared without a sound.

799
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
You just came here to play cards with me.

800
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Are you going to play with me?

801
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Yes.

802
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
You are a math genius.

803
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Calculation, national art, this kind of thing.

804
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Who can beat you?

805
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Didn't you win just now?

806
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Is it because you played too early?

807
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
I'm sorry.

808
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
How are you now?

809
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Don't be polite to me.

810
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
It's useless.

811
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
You want to ask Yin Tao how he is doing?

812
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
He is not good.

813
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Although he doesn't look like a big deal,

814
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
he is saving money every day

815
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
in the magazine.

816
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
He is trying hard to save money.

817
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
No matter where you are,

818
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
he must find you.

819
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
I know.

820
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
He,

821
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
keeps sending me messages.

822
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I'm afraid he will call me.

823
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
So,

824
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I usually turn off the phone.

825
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Only at four or five in the morning,

826
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
I will play the game

827
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
and read his messages.

828
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Such a deep side.

829
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Is it useful to me?

830
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Why don't you tell Yin Tao?

831
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
You know.

832
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
You just send him a message,

833
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
he will be more assured.

834
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
You also see

835
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
what I am now.

836
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
What my life is like now.

837
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Do you think I can be with Yin Tao now?

838
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
What are you like now?

839
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
You lack arms or legs?

840
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
What is your life like now?

841
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Can't eat or sleep?

842
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Not so bad.

843
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
But I don't have much warmth.

844
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Jiang Qiaoxi,

845
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
what's wrong with you?

846
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
If you don't want to say,

847
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I won't ask.

848
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Do you think you are like this now?

849
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Is it the reason that Yin Tao

850
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
can't be with you?

851
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
It's me.

852
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
The reason I can't be with Yin Tao.

853
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
I don't know.

854
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Memories float in the air.

855
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Pass through the window of time.

856
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
The shade of summer is still bright.

857
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
I look far away.

858
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
The wishes that I didn't say that year.

859
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
The shadow of familiar becomes longer.

860
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Your outline is so gentle

861
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,400
beyond the sight.

862
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,400
The world is turning.

863
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
The breeze is blowing.

864
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,400
The scenery in the window.

865
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Like yesterday.

866
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
The reality is in front of me.

867
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,400
The future is in my hands.

868
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,400
You are lucky to who I am.

869
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Be with me and become me.

870
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
The night sky is long.

871
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,400
My strong wind blows.

872
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I can't stop running.

873
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,400
The dream of life is calling.

874
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,400
You are the spark in all my dreams.

875
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Be with you and become yourself.

876
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
The sky is expanding.

877
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
The clouds are melting.

878
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,400
I am always here.

879
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,400
The time in my palm.

880
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,400
It lights up your face.

881
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,400
The smile that runs too fast.

882
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,400
By surprise it is quiet.
