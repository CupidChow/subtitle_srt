1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Don't

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Love and Destiny

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A call.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Qin Ye Yun?

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello?

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is this okay?

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's wrong?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's wrong?

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Qin Ye Yun asked me to help Ying Tao and Jiang Qiao Xi.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Jiang Qiao Xi?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is not easy.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go together.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you can't handle it, we can help you.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You don't even ask what's going on.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Jiang Qiao Xi and Ying Tao's business

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
must be related to her mother.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What else can happen?

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She's right.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But this thing,

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
can you really help her?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What can help?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's always good to have more.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go. Don't be silent.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yi Qiao, are you really going?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why not?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ying Tao has played with us since we were kids.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She must go.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's go.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Jiang Qiao Xi.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello?

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hello, Mrs. Liang.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. He said that

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
he wanted to talk to Jiang Qiao Xi about something.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What did he say?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He said that

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
he wanted to give her some study materials.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What materials?

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What materials?

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What materials?

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Maybe it's about the exam.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll call Mr. He.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Call him.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello?

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How did this happen?

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll be there now.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Xiao Zhang, go get some materials with him

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and send him to the training camp.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do as I said.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mrs. Liang, you're not taking this car?

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The ratio I said before.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The good news is that Jiang Qiao Xi's mother left.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The bad news is that the driver came to get the materials with her.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We have to think of something.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's okay.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll be in charge of the driver.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then you can give the materials to Jiang Qiao Xi.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Jiang Qiao Xi,

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
didn't you leave with your mother?

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mr. He,

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think I still have some materials.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The materials are the ones that Chen Xiaoman organized for you.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She organized them very carefully.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's nothing more.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. He,

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't say it's so absolute.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There must be something left.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I prepared the materials with Chen Xiaoman.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Qiao Xi,

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
don't you have class in the afternoon?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Didn't your mother ask me to send you on time?

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Cai Fang Yuan,

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
what are you doing there?

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. He,

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
she's afraid that I'll leave something behind.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Since there's nothing left,

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll leave first.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jiang Qiao Xi,

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
good luck in the competition.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jiang Qiao Xi?

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Didn't she leave with Aunt Liang?

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who is she with?

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A group of people from the mountains.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shouldn't they be eating at the canteen?

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are they doing?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Qiao Xi,

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll go to the canteen to eat noodles.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can wait in the car or wait under the car.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But I'll eat noodles for at most half an hour.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can save some time.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you, Uncle.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is it good?

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Eat some too.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's all yours.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to eat it with you.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll eat it with you.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll eat it with you.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll eat it with you.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll eat it with you.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll eat it with you.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll eat it with you.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll eat it with you.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Jiang Qiao Xi,

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
when you're alone,

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
do you often feel lonely?

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I feel that I'm not alone.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why is that?

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Because I know you.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You know me?

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was alone when I was ten years old.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But I won't feel lonely

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
after I do math.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But after I met you,

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
it's no use doing math.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't overcome loneliness.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That means your math is not difficult enough.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have to meet a math problem

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that is harder than you.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do you mean?

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well,

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
how are you doing at school?

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I can handle anything else.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But it's too hard to do physics.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why are you so good at solving problems?

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What am I?

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I just use the formula.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're good.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can solve many problems

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
without using the formula.

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm so good?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're so good?

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Then,

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
why didn't you look at me

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
when I was in the office?

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You didn't look at me either.

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I did that because...

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well...

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Because what?

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You tell me first.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why did you do that?

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm not good at solving problems.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You look like a girl today.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you want some water?

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I've spent so many years

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to have a chance

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to have a meal with Lin Yitang.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have to eat more.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We will have more chances

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to have a meal together.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You, me,

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Qin Yeyun,

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yuqiao, Du Shang, and Cai Fangyuan,

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
we will have many meals together.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We will eat in the provincial city,

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in the southern and northern regions.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I don't want to eat in the southern and northern regions.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to eat

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
the food made by Aunt Jun.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Like when we were young.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then you have to teach me

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the food cup like when we were young.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then wait for me to learn the food cup.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I really don't know what kind of evil Jiang Qiaoxi

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
got into Lin Qile.

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She went to the alley with him.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She played with this kind of people

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
just to ruin herself.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What's the big deal?

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They just used to play together when they were young.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They just kept the old habits.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's nothing.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't care at all.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Are you telling me

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
or telling yourself?

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm telling you.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm telling you.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm telling you.

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm telling you.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm telling you.

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm telling you.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Xiaoman, don't lie to yourself.

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't understand.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You know it best.

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Jiang Qiaoxi is different from Lin Qile

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to others.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So what?

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's just temporary.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Jiang Qiaoxi is the best.

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
As long as I'm the best,

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
she will see it clearly.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you really think

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it's about being good or not?

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You are the best.

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
She is the best.

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So you should be the best.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Even if it doesn't matter,

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
it's the Jiang Qiaoxi we know first.

210
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's the Jiang Qiaoxi I know first.

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Xiaoman, don't be anxious.

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Look, is it okay?

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let's tell Aunt Liang about this.

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Aunt Liang said it herself.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's keep an eye on Jiang Qiaoxi.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We have to make her lost.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's my own business.

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can solve it myself.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't need to tell Aunt Liang.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sit tight and leave it to me.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay, teacher.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hello, Mr. He.

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Xiaoman, come here.

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Your basketball baby team

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
did a good job today.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The performance today is very wonderful.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I still have a lot of shortcomings.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't be modest.

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You are still very organized.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yin Qile doesn't have a dance foundation.

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But you dance so well.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Your coach is always praising me.

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You two have been a light for our class.

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Teacher, not only basketball baby,

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I will continue to work hard

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in terms of learning.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I will be a light for the class.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Good boy.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You and Lin Qile

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
have a closer relationship

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
because of this basketball baby experience.

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You should help him more in the future.

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He is not stupid and diligent.

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But he just came.

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He can't keep up with our rhythm.

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You should treat him more.

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Such a good boy

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
can't really be divided into 18 classes.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't worry, Mr. He.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I will help Lin Qile.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Goodbye, teacher.

253
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You are right.

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We should help Jiang Qiaoxi.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let her get lost.

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Then I will call Aunt Liang now.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No need.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This matter

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
can't be only let Aunt Liang know.

261
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yucheng, what are you doing?

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Nothing.

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then you don't talk.

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You...

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The leader Jiang Qiaoxi is too much.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
She has to hide from us

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to eat the food.

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You have tried to eat steamed buns before.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I am just a trainee.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am just a trainee.

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Do you think

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
people only eat steamed buns

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
at this time?

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I am not.

275
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They eat at my home.

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are not much better

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
than the novel you read.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yucheng,

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the book of the Phoenix Fairy

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
said that after reading it,

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
she would lend it to you.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But she was borrowed by Huang Zanjie.

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Huang Zanjie said

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you wouldn't care about it.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't care?

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why doesn't she care?

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well,

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
it's hard enough to get it back for you.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
She is watching

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Zhang Xiao Fan's dance of the Seven Devils.

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's very exciting.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She definitely won't give it back to you.

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If she doesn't want it,

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I will.

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How can there be no

296
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
first come, first served?

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You are destined to be your thing

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and you will be in the way

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
of others.

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's not yours.

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Even if you are in the way of others,

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you have no temper.

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Qianyu,

304
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
say it again.

305
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I want to write it down

306
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and tell Meng Latian

307
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to write it in her novel.

308
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You are silly.

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want to eat steamed buns.

310
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
These two big buns

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
are not for me.

312
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I want to eat steamed buns.

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
These two big buns,

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
what are they doing here?

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
These two mouths

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
are like two loopholes.

317
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
They are leaking everything out.

318
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If they find out...

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You two,

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
what are you doing here?

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Then what are you doing here?

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What else can we do in the farm?

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What about you?

324
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What new news are you going to collect?

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We are just fooling around.

326
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Fooling around?

327
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Not fooling around.

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yu Qiao, let me tell you.

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We have heard that

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Jiang Qiaoxi and Lin Qi Le

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
are there separately.

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Really?

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Who said that?

334
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You don't care about that.

335
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Just play your basketball.

336
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Really?

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Who told you that?

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is it reliable?

339
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The source is confidential.

340
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The news is guaranteed.

341
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If you don't believe in evil,

342
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
then go with us.

343
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yu Qiao,

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I suggest you not to go.

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We are afraid that

346
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
you will be sad.

347
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's go.

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
From here to the time on the bus,

349
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
there is about one minute left.

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What else can we do in one minute?

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We are so stupid.

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why do we have to

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
be entangled in one minute?

354
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Actually, we are

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
very lucky today.

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have completed

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
such an amazing thing.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We even had a meal together.

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We should be very satisfied.

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But I am not satisfied.

361
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yikun,

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
don't be satisfied either.

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We shouldn't be like this.

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I am not satisfied.

365
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I am not satisfied with you.

366
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you think so?

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I am not satisfied with you.

368
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yikun,

369
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
if you don't think so,

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I will be very angry.

371
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I will be very happy.

372
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So,

373
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't want to see you.

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I will be very happy.

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let's go.

376
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Let's go.

377
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's go.

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go.

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's go.

380
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's go.

381
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's go.

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's go.

383
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's go.

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's go.

385
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,080
to gossip about others?

386
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,280
What do you mean?

387
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,360
That's because

388
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,760
when they talk about themselves,

389
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,840
no one likes to listen.

390
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,520
Yu Xiao,

391
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
you can talk about

392
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,400
such reasonable words.

393
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,440
You're so great.

394
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,920
It's a loss if Feng Le Tian is not here.

395
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,000
How many gold bars have you spent as a material?

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,840
Yu Xiao,

397
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,880
what do you mean?

398
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,000
Can you stop

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,520
being so aggressive?

400
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,840
You are angry with others.

401
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,240
Don't blame it on us.

402
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
Why are you so anxious?

403
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,920
I didn't say it was you.

404
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,800
Sisi and Hu Yan are here.

405
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
Jia Sisi.

406
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,040
What's wrong with you?

407
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
Listen to me.

408
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm coming.

409
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,240
Let's go.

410
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,440
Jia Sisi,

411
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,160
when will the comic you drew

412
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,280
be updated?

413
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,280
What comic?

414
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,320
It's the one

415
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,520
in the Meteor Garden.

416
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,280
It's about several men

417
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,400
chasing after a girl.

418
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
Sisi, you drew this kind of comic?

419
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,080
Why didn't you tell me about it?

420
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
How do you know?

421
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,760
You stole my stuff.

422
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,960
I didn't mean it.

423
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,760
Your good friend in middle school,

424
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,280
Wushuang,

425
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,040
was in a team with me.

426
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,320
When you showed it to him,

427
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,520
he took a look at it.

428
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,440
We all think you're good at drawing.

429
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
It's a fun story.

430
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,600
Really?

431
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
I just drew it casually.

432
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,800
Hurry up.

433
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,840
Be careful.

434
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,600
Go up first.

435
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
Don't move.

436
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,840
I'll help you.

437
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,440
It's not high enough.

438
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,520
I'll go down first.

439
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,040
Don't move.

440
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,560
Okay.

441
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,240
It's your own story

442
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
to tell it to others.

443
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,960
Rather than caring about others' stories,

444
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
you'd better think about

445
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
your own story.

446
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,160
Your own story

447
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,240
is also interesting.

448
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,560
Okay.

449
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,720
Wait.

450
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,480
Qin Yulin,

451
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,680
you used to send people

452
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,920
with chin shells.

453
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,800
How did you

454
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,400
say such nice things today?

455
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,080
I got it.

456
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,440
Sisi,

457
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,520
don't listen to them.

458
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,800
They're all from Qunshan.

459
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,160
They're all Lin Qi Le's friends.

460
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,760
They have such a big voice.

461
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,120
They must be helping him

462
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
to stall for time.

463
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,520
Let's go.

464
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,080
Come on.

465
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,440
I'll help you.

466
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Let me hold it.

467
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,520
I can do it.

468
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,040
Dog.

469
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't run.

470
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,760
Sisi.

471
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,640
Don't run.

472
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,320
Let me down.

473
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,080
Let me down.

474
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,840
Don't run.

475
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,520
Come on.

476
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I'll go down.

477
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,480
You...

478
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,200
You...

479
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,840
You...

480
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,240
No one's here.

481
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,360
No one's here.

482
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,000
Lin Mi, help me.

483
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm begging you.

484
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,800
Lin Mi.

485
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,360
Help me.

486
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,080
Let me down.

487
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,280
Let me down.

488
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,440
It's okay.

489
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm sorry.

490
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,680
It's okay.

491
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,360
Help me up.

492
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm fine.

493
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,960
Are you okay?

494
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,880
Are you okay?

495
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,800
No.

496
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,680
You're hurt.

497
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,320
You're okay?

498
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,840
What's wrong?

499
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
It's bleeding.

500
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,760
It's bleeding.

501
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,080
Oh, no.

502
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,840
You're bleeding.

503
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,760
You're bleeding.

504
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,600
It's bleeding.

505
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,240
Mi No.

506
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll send you to the hospital.

507
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,080
No.

508
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,160
Lu Tao.

509
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,920
You haven't gone back to school?

510
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm so sorry,

511
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,040
for causing you so much trouble.

512
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,640
I'm so sorry.

513
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
I'm sorry for everything.

514
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
We're still checking.

515
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
We'll talk about it when we get the result.

516
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,800
Zhao.

517
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,920
Mr. Yang.

518
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,840
How's Qiao Xi?

519
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,640
We're still checking.

520
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

521
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,680
In the CT room?

522
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,160
Yes.

523
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,720
In the CT room?

524
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,200
I'll go check.

525
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,720
Okay.

526
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,560
Mr. Ying.

527
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,280
Why are you here?

528
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,800
Uncle Jiang.

529
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,040
I...

530
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
Qiao Xi...

531
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,880
He...

532
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,920
He was hit by a car.

533
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,960
He did it to protect me.

534
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay.

535
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,880
It's okay.

536
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,560
Don't cry.

537
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,480
I'll go check.

539
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Don't worry.

540
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,240
Ms. Qian.

541
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,120
You've got the credentials here.

542
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Come.

543
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,520
Light up the burning passion in your heart.

544
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
you still say we are not meant to be together.

545
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
I am taking you.

546
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,240
What do you mean?

547
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
I...

548
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,800
I really...

549
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,240
really hate her.

550
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,560
Can you

551
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,280
really

552
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
protect her?

553
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,880
She can't.

554
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,280
But she can.

555
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
You still own her好 reservation.

556
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,960
I'm going back to the classroom.

557
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,560
Yin Tao.

558
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,040
Ceng Xiao Man is crying in the classroom.

559
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,960
Jiang Qiao Xi is hurt.

560
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,600
She must be very upset.

561
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,280
She thinks it's all because of you.

562
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,280
When you go back,

563
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
if she and those girls

564
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,040
are upset with you...

565
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm not afraid.

566
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm not afraid of these things.

567
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm not afraid of them either.

568
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,240
They should be afraid of me.

569
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,320
They should be afraid that I'll be upset with them.

570
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,320
What are you doing?

571
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,200
Hurry up and go.

572
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,440
Your mom has already got

573
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
the phone number of the electric car driver.

574
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,360
How did you get into an accident?

575
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
What kind of accident did you have?

576
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,560
She has already known everything.

577
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,240
Qiao Xi.

578
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,360
The most important thing now

579
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
is to learn.

580
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,040
Dad.

581
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
It's already at this time.

582
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,840
Do you still have to say such things?

583
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,160
Can you help me?

584
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
I can say it.

585
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,400
This time, you help us as a family.

586
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,760
My mom told me

587
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
if I come to Li Yin Tao again,

588
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,840
she will transfer Uncle Lin to the construction site in Fujian.

589
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,360
Dad.

590
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,160
Bring a family to a place where they are not familiar with each other.

591
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,360
You probably won't be able to understand

592
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
what's going on.

593
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
If she really did hurt Uncle Lin,

594
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
what did Uncle Lin say?

595
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
I will resist.

596
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,880
Resist?

597
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,240
How will you resist?

598
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,280
I will resist her.

599
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
I will use her in private.

600
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,120
You are mother and son.

601
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,480
Why did you have to go to this point?

602
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,960
Why did you have to go to this point?

603
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,960
Dad.

604
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,360
I went to this point with my mom.

605
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,280
As a father,

606
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,720
don't you have any responsibility?

607
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,280
All these years,

608
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,640
every time I have a conflict with her,

609
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,280
you are like a hidden person.

610
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,760
You completely ignore her feelings

611
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,200
and completely ignore my feelings.

612
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,600
When she completely suppresses me,

613
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,760
when she completely wins,

614
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,720
you come out

615
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,320
and give her a little compliment

616
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,520
and comfort.

617
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,960
Don't you have any relationship with this family?

618
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,640
All these years,

619
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,360
you never let yourself

620
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,960
be in the hands of the storm.

621
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
In fact, all these years,

622
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,160
Dad has been in the storm.

623
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,600
I have never come out.

624
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,920
Yes.

625
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Your storm

626
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,880
is always arguing with her.

627
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,240
Who did

628
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,520
wrong in that year?

629
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
But now,

630
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,320
I am also your child.

631
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,720
You are not an outsider between me and her.

632
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,880
Don't you think...

633
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,720
Don't you think

634
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
what she did to me is right?

635
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes.

636
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
If it's wrong,

637
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,800
can you stand up

638
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
and say something?

639
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Do something.

640
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
Maybe just this once.

641
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
When Ceng Xiaoman just finished

642
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,360
talking to Jiang Qiaoxi's mother,

643
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,440
how could it be fake?

644
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,640
Jiang Qiaoxi's mother said so herself.

645
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
Jiang Qiaoxi has been faked.

646
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
She is going crazy.

647
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh my god.

648
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,480
Is Jiang Qiaoxi going to ruin herself?

649
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,720
Lin Qi Le.

650
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,280
What did you do to Jiang Qiaoxi?

651
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,920
Kai Qi.

652
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,800
Son.

653
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,680
Tell me what you want.

654
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,240
Why should I tell you

655
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,480
what I did to Jiang Qiaoxi?

656
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,000
I want to be

657
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,960
a good friend to Jiang Qiaoxi.

658
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,680
I want to be a good friend

659
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,160
to Lin Yintao.

660
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,240
When we were in school,

661
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,960
why did I eat with him

662
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,560
and my friends I chose?

663
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,920
Go to school together.

664
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,320
Go to school together.

665
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Ride a bus.

666
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,520
Or ride a bicycle.

667
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,320
I want to be a good friend to Jiang Qiaoxi.

668
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
I want to be a good friend to Jiang Qiaoxi.

669
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,360
I want to be a good friend to Lin Yintao.

670
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,240
Ride a bus.

671
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,120
If you have time on weekends,

672
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,280
we can climb mountains together.

673
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,040
Just like when we were young.

674
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,320
I want to be a good friend to Jiang Qiaoxi.

675
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
I want to be a good friend to Jiang Qiaoxi.

676
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,960
Your eyes are so gentle

677
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,840
beyond the sight.

678
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,720
The world is turning.

679
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,480
The wind is blowing.

680
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,880
The sky is clear.

681
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,920
The air is fresh.

682
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,320
Jiang Qiaoxi is with him.

683
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,520
No wonder the wind is so good.

684
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
I miss him.

685
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,720
Jiang Qiaoxi is so young.

686
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,520
Why is he so young?

687
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,320
Like yesterday.

688
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,520
Why is he so young?

689
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,200
In front of me,

690
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
the future is in my hands.

691
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,560
Lin Yintao,

692
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,480
do you know that Jiang Qiaoxi's mother hates you?

693
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,560
I know.

694
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,480
But Jiang Qiaoxi doesn't hate me.

695
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,120
I don't need to be her mother's friend.

696
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,360
But you are not on the same path.

697
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,200
The night sky is full of stars.

698
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,240
Whatever you say.

699
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,560
But I want to tell you something.

700
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,760
Your comments

701
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
can't affect me anymore.

702
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,160
You're the key to all I dream.

703
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,720
I'll accompany you to become yourself.

704
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,520
The story is flying.

705
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
My strong wind is blowing.

706
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,040
I can't stop running.

707
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,280
The call of the dream.

708
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,080
You're the spark in all my dreams.

709
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,160
I think she

710
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,080
will have wings.

711
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,400
I read in the book that

712
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,760
if you jump high enough,

713
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,600
you will have wings on your back.

714
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm curious.

715
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,240
I'm always here.

716
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,160
The light in my palm

717
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,240
illuminates your face.

718
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Your smile runs too fast.

719
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,120
I accidentally

720
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,840
hide it.

721
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,720
Look.

722
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
The result is out.

723
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,480
There's no blood in the poison.

724
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,440
It's just a wound.

725
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,360
No big problem.

726
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,800
Does it hurt?

727
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,400
No.

728
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,560
You bled so much

729
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
and got stitches.

730
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,320
How can it not hurt?

731
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,040
You kids.

732
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,560
You forget it after you're done.

733
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,760
These pains will always be on me.

734
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,360
Do you know

735
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,920
there're many sucedences in this world?

736
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
I want to know.

737
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,640
Ask about your try in this Mexico trip.

738
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,440
If you can defeat me now,

739
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,200
you will have a advantages.

740
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,240
Fill up your drinks.

741
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,000
Make use of this poison.

742
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,600
The competition is to protect you.

743
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,560
Otherwise, you'll have a big problem.

744
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,360
Like today, you'll have a headache.

745
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,280
It's just a small injury.

746
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,440
I don't feel pain.

747
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm going back to my room.

748
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,760
You don't feel pain, right?

749
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,880
Then you pay the bill.

750
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,640
I told you before.

751
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,720
You know it.

752
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,720
Mom, do you think I can't afford it?

753
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,440
I'm afraid you can't afford it.

754
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm telling you, mom.

755
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
If you treat Lin family...

756
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,200
Liang Honghui.

757
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,680
Listen.

758
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
If you do anything to Lin family,

759
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'll cut you off.

760
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,640
You'll be used for personal use.

761
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,040
Jiang Zheng.

762
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,040
You're really getting better as a leader.

763
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,440
You're getting better as a father.

764
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,360
You didn't protect me well back then.

765
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,760
Now you want Jiang Qiaoxi to do it?

766
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,200
I don't want to talk about the past with you.

767
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
Now Qiaoxi wants to be with her friends.

768
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,320
Have a normal relationship.

769
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,800
Why do you become a selfish person when you're young?

770
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,600
What friend?

771
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,880
When you were young,

772
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,720
your son jumped off here

773
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,600
because of her.

774
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,160
He ran back to the group with his legs.

775
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,600
Now it's because of her.

776
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,200
He fell and his head was bleeding.

777
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,120
Now it's like this.

778
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,600
Do you dare to think about it in the future?

779
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,080
What kind of friend is this?

780
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,320
This is a disaster.

781
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Liang Honghui.

782
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,640
She's like this because you forced her.

783
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,480
If it's a disaster,

784
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,240
it's also a disaster for us.

785
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,080
You don't deserve to be the father of my two children.

786
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,000
Since you don't want to let Lin Jia go,

787
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,280
let's transfer to another school.

788
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,080
Go to an international school.

789
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,200
The farther the better.

790
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
I'll stay with you.

791
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Let's move.

792
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
I know that it's easy for you to transfer to another school.

793
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,000
I know that

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
you're not going to be able to go to another school.

795
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,480
You're going to be a good daughter.

796
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I know that.

797
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,400
But I don't want to be a bad daughter.

798
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
I don't want to be a bad daughter.

799
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
I don't want to be a bad daughter.

800
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
You need to do what I do.

801
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,600
But

802
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
Тace Brothers is about to start...

803
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,340
I don't want to...

804
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
make the transfer affect my performance.

805
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,000
Do you know what you're saying?

806
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,880
You spoke this perception for one guy who's like that.

807
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,480
no matter when you get chosen,

808
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,760
you should choose Aosu,

809
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,960
not him.

810
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,880
It has nothing to do with choosing.

811
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,760
If I really have to choose,

812
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,400
it's because I chose myself.

813
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
I chose my own life.

814
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Why would you choose

815
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,560
your own life

816
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,080
after all my heart want?

817
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
What about me?

818
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,160
What about my life?

819
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,680
Mom...

820
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
Your life

821
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,160
has nothing to do with

822
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,240
my life.

823
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Why do you want to be like me?

824
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
I'm sorry, mom.

825
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,240
I'm going to get the award for Jiang Meng.

826
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
Can I start the question?

827
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Are you forcing me with your brother?

828
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
What are you forcing me with?

829
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
No.

830
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,240
You are forcing me with Jiang Meng.

831
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Mr. Liang, have some water.

832
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
You're welcome.

833
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
I rushed here today to disturb you.

834
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
But as a mother,

835
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
I hope you can understand.

836
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
What happened, Mr. Liang?

837
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
When I had a meeting this afternoon,

838
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
the driver called me.

839
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
He said that he was going to the hospital.

840
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
I told him to wait for me.

841
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
But he didn't answer.

842
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I told him to wait for me.

843
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
But he didn't answer.

844
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
I called him.

845
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Jiang Qiaoxi was hit by an electric car.

846
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
He fell to the ground.

847
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
He was beaten several times.

848
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Is Qiaoxi okay now?

849
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Ning,

850
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
I heard that he was with you when he was hurt.

851
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
As a mother,

852
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
my son was so badly hurt.

853
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,240
We should know why.

854
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Ying Tao,

855
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
you should tell me clearly

856
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
what happened.

857
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
I'm sorry, Mrs. Liang.

858
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Jiang Qiaoxi was hurt because she wanted to protect me.

859
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Ying Tao.

860
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Mr. Liang, I'm really sorry.

861
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
We'll pay Qiaoxi's medical expenses.

862
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
If you need us to do something,

863
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
we...

864
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
What medical expenses?

865
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
I just want to know the real situation.

866
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
Ying Tao,

867
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
this afternoon,

868
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,240
my driver sent Qiaoxi to the Olympic Games.

869
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Why was he with you?

870
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
He was hurt to save you.

871
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Tell me quickly.

872
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
We were in the alley in the afternoon.

873
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I sent him food.

874
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Then a classmate came over.

875
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
We hid from him.

876
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Then there was an accident.

877
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Why did you hide from your classmate?

878
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
He would misunderstand if he saw you.

879
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,240
What did he misunderstand?

880
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Mrs. Liang,

881
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Jiang Qiaoxi and I

882
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
didn't do anything bad.

883
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
We're just good friends.

884
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Ying Tao,

885
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
don't be nervous.

886
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I didn't mean to blame you.

887
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
You're young and immature.

888
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Sheng Juan,

889
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
the last time was a bad accident.

890
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
This time,

891
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
there was another accident.

892
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Mrs. Liang,

893
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
we've caused you trouble.

894
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
I'm not worried about Qiaoxi.

895
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
Because he's a boy.

896
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
He's welcomed by his female classmates.

897
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,240
I can understand Ying Tao's desire to play with him.

898
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
But Ying Tao is a girl.

899
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
I don't want to leave any bad news

900
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
to Ying Tao because of Qiaoxi.

901
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Mrs. Liang,

902
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
it has nothing to do with whether she's a girl or not.

903
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
And Jiang Qiaoxi and I are friends.

904
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
It has nothing to do with whether she's welcomed or not.

905
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Ying Tao.

906
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
He's too straightforward.

907
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
He's a boy.

908
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
It's okay.

909
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
I won't bother you.

910
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mrs. Liang.

911
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Sheng Juan,

912
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
children are young.

913
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
They're young.

914
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
They're not sure.

915
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
But as parents,

916
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
we should help them.

917
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Otherwise,

918
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
those gossip

919
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
will not only be on the children,

920
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
but also on us.

921
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
If it's a joke,

922
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
it'll be better.

923
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
If it's a lie,

924
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
it'll be bad.

925
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
Mrs. Liang, take care.

926
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Why did she say that?

927
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
It's okay.

928
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
It's just an accident.

929
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
You said that

930
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
because you were too nervous and scared.

931
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Once in the night,

932
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
I was like a true lover.

933
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
The north wind blew

934
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,240
and I couldn't find my place to stay.

935
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Once in the dream,

936
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,240
I thought of the sea.

937
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,240
But I heard the sound of the dream.

938
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Through the darkness,

939
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,240
I found the extraordinary power.

940
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
My dream,

941
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I want to let go.

942
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,240
I want to let you see

943
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
the light in my heart.

944
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
I want to sing

945
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
for you

946
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,240
my loneliness and confusion.

947
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I want to forget

948
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,240
the ordinary growth.

949
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I'm dizzy and looking at the distance.

950
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Once in the dream,

951
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
I smelled

952
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
the white night flowers

953
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,240
in the night sky.

954
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Through the darkness,

955
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,240
I found the extraordinary power.

956
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
My dream,

957
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,240
I want to let go.

958
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,240
I want to let you see

959
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,240
the light in my heart.

960
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
I want to sing

961
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
for you

962
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,240
my loneliness and confusion.

963
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,240
I want to forget

964
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,240
the ordinary growth.

965
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:14,240
I'm dizzy and looking at the distance.
