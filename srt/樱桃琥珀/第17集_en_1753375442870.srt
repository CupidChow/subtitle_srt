Episode 2

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Li Jun.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you think

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Si Si's boyfriend

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
will know what she said is a lie?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It doesn't matter if he knows.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What matters is

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that he knows Si Si's attitude now.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He won't come to see Si Si again.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It sounds so sad.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Really?

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm relieved for them.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They've been together for almost a year.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Today, we finally talk it out.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a relief for them.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I thought you two were good friends.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We are good friends.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It doesn't matter if they are good friends or not.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's talk about the scene

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
under the dorm tonight.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It feels like they have a deep love.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can see it later.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This person hugged another person.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That person bit another person.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nobody has slept for too long.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The school is about to close.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because of this,

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
everyone is hungry.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's not true.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not a good person.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Someone will be together for a long time.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tell me.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't say it.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know it.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not the same thing.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Li Jun.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You are three years older than me.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why do you pretend to be an adult in front of me?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What do you mean?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm an adult.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You are an adult after 18 years old.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Welcome to the adult world.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's very realistic and cruel here.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can't adults have someone they like?

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You said something.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I said,

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
even adults have someone they like.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What about you?

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you have someone you like?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Of course I have.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's it.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What do you like?

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I've known him since I was a kid.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He is different from everyone I know.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He doesn't understand what I say.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He does things far away from me.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
he is very beautiful.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When I see him,

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I feel that time can stop.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Butterflies can fly out of his belly.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Me too.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The person I like and I

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
have known since I was a kid.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I sometimes feel

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
the same way you said.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The person I like

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is 15 years older than me.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He got married about 8 years ago.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
His wife is very beautiful.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They are very close.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't feel angry

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
when I see them together.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They have two children.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The person you like

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
got married and has a child.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He got married 8 years ago.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You were only 13 years old then.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The person I like

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is a star.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What?

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You really like him?

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What about the person we like?

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I won't tell you.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Liar. You are a bad person.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Liar.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Liar.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I just found out today

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that the adult world

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is not interesting

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
after 18 years old.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Did you go to the adult world

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
so that I can't find you?

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I was wrong.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
Why are you here?

187
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,560
I just want to come and see you.

188
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
If I can see you,

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
I'll give you the milk card.

190
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
If I can't see you,

191
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll drink it alone.

192
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,240
When did you become so cunning?

193
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
You just called me.

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,600
And you're involved in Su Ming Le's case.

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
The environment in your school is really good.

196
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,120
There are many small animals.

197
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
When you enter, you see little wild cats,

198
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,480
workers, foxes and swans.

199
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,560
There are also little pigs reading in the library.

200
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
Lin Ying Tao.

201
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Let me tell you.

202
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
At the age of 18,

203
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,960
it's the last chance for you to grow from 1.59m to 1.6m.

204
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,200
Don't learn to lose weight and drink milk tea.

205
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,480
First of all,

206
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,560
I was already 1.6m.

207
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
Secondly,

208
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,800
your milk tea has nothing to do with your height.

209
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,840
I asked my dad to call Liang Hong Fei.

210
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,680
After all, she is Jiang Xiao Xi's mother.

211
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
She wouldn't even know where Jiang Xiao Xi is.

212
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
You don't have to thank me.

213
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,280
Jiang Xiao Xi is also my friend.

214
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,840
She just left like that and didn't leave a word.

215
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,320
I have to ask her clearly.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,720
I wanted to find her before.

217
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,200
I could go to her house to find her.

218
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,120
Go to the Olympic Games and training camp.

219
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,960
But now I want to find her.

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,680
Even if I open the world map,

221
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
I don't know what to look at.

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
It's okay.

223
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,760
At least she won't go to outer space.

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,680
I don't want to grow up so much.

225
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,960
I think it's not fun to be an adult.

226
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,720
Being an adult

227
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,240
feels like there are many difficulties.

228
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,040
Isn't it hard when we were kids?

229
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,760
It's hard when we know crying is useless.

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's different.

231
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
It's the kind of life

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
when you decide how to live.

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
It's the kind of life

234
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,160
when you are still a kid

235
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,600
but you learn to be an adult.

236
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:19,600
I think how you eat

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
is really important.

238
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Actually, it's okay if no one is there to accompany me.

239
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
It's nothing.

240
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
I feel like in the university,

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
everyone is not very familiar with each other.

242
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
But don't worry about me.

243
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
My seniors are all very nice to me.

244
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Lin Yingtao, you just got into the university,

245
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
and you're already so generous.

246
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Yingtao.

247
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Senior.

248
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Where did you go?

249
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I just came back from the library.

250
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
You came back? Where did you go?

251
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I was in the dorm.

252
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Yuqiao, I'm a hair-small.

253
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm a freshman in the next north aviation school.

254
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
This is my senior, Meng Lijun.

255
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Senior, hello.

256
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Hello.

257
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Yingtao.

258
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
You said she was your hair-small.

259
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
So you two grew up together, right?

260
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Isn't hair-small just growing up together?

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
I understand.

262
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Yes.

263
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
What's wrong with her?

264
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
What are you doing?

265
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Don't look.

266
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
It's okay. I'm up.

267
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
You two talk.

268
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm up.

269
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
What are you doing?

270
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
It's a birth.

271
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Give me a check.

272
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Sit down.

273
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Give me a check.

274
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Sit down.

275
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Hurry up.

276
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Master Yingtao.

277
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
What are we going to check?

278
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Don't run.

279
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Come back with me.

280
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
What are you doing?

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Our Miss Lin is the most uncivilized.

282
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,880
She hid a little boyfriend in the next school.

283
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
It's good to hide it.

284
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
She never told us, right?

285
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
No, she's really not my boyfriend.

286
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
She's my hair-small.

287
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm really hair-small.

288
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Still want to hide?

289
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
You said it when you took a shower.

290
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
The person you like grew up with you since childhood.

291
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
And she's very pretty.

292
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Isn't this all right with the boy in the north?

293
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
It's really not her.

294
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Master, explanation is a cover-up.

295
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Cover-up is the fact.

296
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
It's really not her.

297
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
It's someone else.

298
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Lin Qi Le.

299
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
You can.

300
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
You still hide the second male guest.

301
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,880
You have something to do tonight.

302
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Hurry up and tell the organization about your 18 years of past.

303
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Come on.

304
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Stop.

305
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Really?

306
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I have a long story with her.

307
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
It's a long story.

308
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
The excitement is here.

309
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
You have no way out.

310
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Hurry up.

311
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Her name is Jiang Qiao Xi.

312
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
I met Jiang Qiao Xi when I was nine years old.

313
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I've never seen a child like her.

314
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
I even think she's from another world.

315
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Actually, before I met her,

316
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I thought I knew the answer to everything.

317
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
But after I met her,

318
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I found that I didn't understand more and more things.

319
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I understand.

320
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Green plum and bamboo horse.

321
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
The relationship between two little vegetables.

322
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,880
And the way to heal the wounds of youth.

323
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Your story doesn't involve

324
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
the story of a friend turning against the tree,

325
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
having a miscarriage, or having a ghost, right?

326
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
I beg you.

327
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,140
Don't make this a

328
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,880
science fiction.

329
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
It's not that complicated.

330
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
But it's not that simple.

331
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
When I was a kid,

332
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
adults all said

333
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,880
she was a strange math genius.

334
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Everything about her was black.

335
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Jiang Qiao Xi,

336
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
what does your name mean?

337
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
I don't know.

338
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
She doesn't know what her name means.

339
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
She doesn't know what color she likes.

340
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Jiang Qiao Xi, make a wish.

341
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Du Shang,

342
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I want to give you this wish.

343
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
You make a wish.

344
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
But I can always see

345
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
the warmth of the relationship.

346
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
I thought

347
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,880
we would grow up like this.

348
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
I even thought

349
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
we would never grow up.

350
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
But one day,

351
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
her mother came.

352
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Jiang Qiao Xi!

353
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Write a letter!

354
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Write a letter to me!

355
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
No. 1,

356
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
bring back my Han Jiang Monkey!

357
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
So stupid.

358
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
So stupid.

359
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
What happened after

360
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
her mother took her away?

361
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
We haven't seen each other for six years.

362
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
When we met,

363
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
we were in high school.

364
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
I don't know her.

365
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
So from now on,

366
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
if we meet again,

367
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
we can pretend we don't know each other.

368
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Stop it.

369
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Pretend we never met.

370
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
You're not going.

371
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm leaving.

372
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Lin Qi Le, you're so arrogant.

373
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
You're shameless.

374
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
How am I shameless?

375
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Cheng Rong Yu is also mine.

376
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
We have a lot of

377
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
memories of our own.

378
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Do whatever you want.

379
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Don't get into trouble.

380
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
How can you say that?

381
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Yin Tao!

382
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
I haven't changed!

383
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Yin Tao!

384
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm leaving.

385
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Yang Xiao Xi,

386
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
when you're alone,

387
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
do you often feel lonely?

388
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
I feel lonely

389
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
not because of one person.

390
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
What's the reason?

391
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Because I know you.

392
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I was alone

393
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
when I was ten years old.

394
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
But as long as I did math,

395
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I wouldn't feel lonely.

396
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
But after I met you,

397
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
it's no use talking about this.

398
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
I can't overcome loneliness.

399
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Yin Tao,

400
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I might miss you when you were 18.

401
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
But I don't want to miss

402
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,880
the moment when you become an adult.

403
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I always think

404
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
if you wear a pair of shoes

405
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
and put on lipstick,

406
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
you'll look very good.

407
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I want to be the first one to see you.

408
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
You can always see me.

409
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Are you suffering?

410
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
I'm okay.

411
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Yang Xiao Xi,

412
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
why are you here?

413
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Are you afraid

414
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
that if you long for me

415
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
and late at night,

416
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
Don't forget me.

417
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,040
Actually, I didn't feel anything at that time.

418
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,000
I just thought it was weird

419
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
every time I recalled it.

420
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,120
What he didn't know is

421
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
it's harder to forget him

422
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,760
than to remember him.

423
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,680
Do you still want to find him?

424
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,080
I want to find him.

425
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
He's already part of my body.

426
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,760
So it's no different

427
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,360
from finding myself

428
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
to find him.

429
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
But don't you think

430
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,240
the reason he did that

431
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,720
is because he didn't want you to see him again

432
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,480
and you couldn't find him?

433
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
It's like hiding a hideout.

434
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,720
It's easier to hide than to be found.

435
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Maybe I'm just unlucky.

436
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,920
I'll always be the one who finds him.

437
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,080
How do you want to find him?

438
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,040
Go to Hong Kong?

439
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
Go to the US?

440
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
Go to the sea to find him?

441
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,840
Even if you have the time,

442
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,760
where can you find so much money?

443
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm saving money now.

444
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,480
Ying Tao,

445
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,760
don't be silly, okay?

446
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,360
You're talking about Jiang Qiaoxi,

447
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,880
but you're Lin Qi Le, okay?

448
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,280
If you're a silly Ying Tao,

449
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,080
you can find him

450
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,560
and you'll be happy.

451
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
Have you ever thought

452
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,600
that he wouldn't know

453
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,280
what life is like

454
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,840
without you?

455
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,480
But if you didn't have him,

456
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,480
you'd be happier and more relaxed.

457
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,720
Why are you doing this to yourself?

458
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,800
I think that boy from the North

459
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,960
is pretty good.

460
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,080
He likes you at first sight.

461
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,720
Senior, stop it.

462
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,360
We're really just friends.

463
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
I've told you.

464
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,240
And I like Jiang Qiaoxi.

465
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,200
So I've decided to like him.

466
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,640
I won't like anyone else.

467
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,440
Okay, okay, okay.

468
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,400
You can find him if you want.

469
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,840
You'd better do this forever.

470
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,640
If you can't find him,

471
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,760
just like the character in the movie

472
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,240
The Great Door, Jiang Wen Li.

473
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
Marry him.

474
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,280
Senior,

475
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,840
I think

476
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,240
you're like a friend of mine.

477
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,880
Every time you talk,

478
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,760
I feel like he's talking.

479
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,480
Jiang Qiaoxi,

480
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
I've told our story

481
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,800
to the seniors.

482
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,200
It's like you

483
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,240
brought me to my new life.

484
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,240
From now on,

485
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,720
this place is not

486
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,960
without you.

487
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,480
Ying Tao,

488
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,280
you like him.

489
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
You'd better like that star

490
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,280
like me.

491
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Did you hear that?

492
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,640
Sister Xiao,

493
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,200
forget my letter.

494
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,800
And don't get mad at me like this.

495
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,360
You're not

496
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
in Icy Mengyin's heart.

497
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,860
Now,

498
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,120
I want to be with you

499
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,280
somewhere else.

500
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay?

501
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,320
I own others' business,

502
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,440
but If I come across any trouble,

503
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,760
just save the NO

504
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,080
Hit me,

505
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,280
That tall guy

506
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,120
If I tell you,

507
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,000
Be honest with me.

508
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,800
Now the 놀�isc esque

509
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,280
¿'ll buy it later.

510
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,920
Aha

511
00:24:50,360 --> 00:25:02,500
It was so

512
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Just us eating, why are you being so polite?

513
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
How can that be?

514
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
This is specially for you to go back to your hometown to prepare for your exam.

515
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
It's okay. My father is a bit formal.

516
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Hurry up. Hurry up.

517
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Yun Tao, Yun Tao, hurry up.

518
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Lin Qi Le.

519
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Lin Qi Le, hello.

520
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Hello.

521
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
I... I often see you in the library.

522
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I want to know what book you are reading.

523
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,240
English, 4th level, Liberals.

524
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,240
And probably Harry Potter.

525
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
I like Harry Potter too.

526
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Let's be friends.

527
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Your shoelaces are untied.

528
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
You...

529
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Why are you here?

530
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Let's go.

531
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Thank you, but I'm sorry.

532
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
What's going on?

533
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Let me take you to learn a new language.

534
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
How about learning a familiar language?

535
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Why do you need to learn a familiar language?

536
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I don't understand.

537
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Isn't it easier for you to encounter this kind of situation in the future?

538
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
You don't know how to speak.

539
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
You are just a pen and a brush.

540
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Anyway, there are so many people who want to know you.

541
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
You don't have anyone who wants to know you.

542
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Senior.

543
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I suddenly have something to do.

544
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
You guys go first.

545
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
You guys eat first. Don't wait for me.

546
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
I'll be right back.

547
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
You guys go ahead. Don't wait for me.

548
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Hello?

549
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Aunt Liang.

550
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I'm Lin Ying Tao.

551
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I'm sorry to bother you.

552
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
But I want to ask you something.

553
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
She is no longer the Jiang Xiaoqi she used to be.

554
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Don't look for her anymore.

555
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Can you tell me where she is?

556
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
She doesn't answer my phone anymore.

557
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
She insists on doing this.

558
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
No one can do anything about it.

559
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
If I don't tell you where she is,

560
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
we still have a chance to be a couple.

561
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Telling you this

562
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
means we can't be a couple anymore.

563
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Ying Tao.

564
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Enjoy your college life.

565
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Don't think about looking for her anymore.

566
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Don't call me anymore.

567
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Lin Si.

568
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I wish you a prosperous and prosperous world.

569
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Three thousand years.

570
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,240
A hundred plates of high-end high-end.

571
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay.

572
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I wish you a happy ending.

573
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
And a long life.

574
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
You're not using the right words.

575
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm not saying it right now.

576
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
What's wrong?

577
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Life is like a cloud of water.

578
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Right?

579
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
It's full of changes.

580
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
It's good and hard.

581
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
No.

582
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
No?

583
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Don't make me think about it.

584
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
I'll tell you right away.

585
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Why are they all down?

586
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
That's normal.

587
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Are you okay?

588
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Ying Tao.

589
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm sorry.

590
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
You're a freshman this year.

591
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
You're officially feeling

592
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
that everything is very fresh

593
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
and promising.

594
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,240
You're going to have a meal with us today.

595
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
What are you talking about, Senior?

596
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I'll give you a toast.

597
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
I'll give you a toast too.

598
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
I...

599
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I don't know how to say those old words.

600
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,240
I wish you a successful exam

601
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
and a successful case.

602
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Okay.

603
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
What are you doing?

604
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Hello, Yichuan.

605
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
From now on,

606
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I won't teach you.

607
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,240
This is your new teacher's phone number.

608
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Be nice to him.

609
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Don't make him angry.

610
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Don't worry.

611
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
I'll talk to your parents.

612
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Bye.

613
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
What do you mean?

614
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
This is the phone number

615
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I made for my tutor.

616
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,240
He's in the third grade of primary school this year.

617
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
He's very obedient and smart.

618
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
He's 80 in an hour.

619
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
He can earn a lot of money if he teaches well.

620
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Why did you give me this job?

621
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Aren't you going to find your boyfriend?

622
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
You don't have enough money.

623
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Of course, you have to open up and save money.

624
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Isn't that better?

625
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
I...

626
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
I thought

627
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,240
you thought I was stupid.

628
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
What do you mean by stupid?

629
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
What do you mean by smart?

630
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Mingtong,

631
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,240
not everyone is like you.

632
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
You won't be broken,

633
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
you won't be changed,

634
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,240
and you won't love others more than you love yourself.

635
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
If this is called stupid,

636
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I'm pretty smart.

637
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Do you think I have a lot of good points?

638
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
I like you.

639
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,240
ISA, I'm not as great as you said.

640
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
I mean it.

641
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,240
I don't know what I should do now.

642
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
What I can do.

643
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
To be honest, I'm really afraid.

644
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I think I have a lot of things

645
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I can't figure out.

646
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
I don't know why,

647
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,240
I don't know why Jiang Taoxi

648
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
to say goodbye to me.

649
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,360
He could have stopped studying math.

650
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,400
Why did he

651
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,880
disappear all of a sudden?

652
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,360
Why can't he contact me?

653
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,200
Actually, the thing I'm most afraid of

654
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,280
is that he told me

655
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,560
not to forget him.

656
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,040
But I always remember him.

657
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
What if he forgets me?

658
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Even if it's ten or twenty years later,

659
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
I'll still remember him.

660
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,760
But where was he then?

661
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,000
Did he ever remember me?

662
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,040
Have you ever heard of a story

663
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,200
called The Miracle of Edward?

664
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,320
It's a

665
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,240
fairy tale.

666
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,560
The protagonist is a rabbit named Edward.

667
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,760
He left his master

668
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
for various reasons.

669
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,160
Then he started to wander.

670
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
He was very lonely.

671
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,200
His memory was getting worse.

672
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,320
No one remembered what his name was.

673
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
In that kind of

674
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,920
a life without love

675
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,520
and memory,

676
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,320
he could only tell himself

677
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,640
that he loved someone.

678
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,560
Someone loved me very much.

679
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,280
Someone would always remember my name.

680
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
That's how he could

681
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,960
continue to live

682
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
in that life.

683
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,880
But the ending of your story

684
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,440
is good.

685
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
It's good.

686
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,080
It's good.

687
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,040
Only in a story without love

688
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,240
can there be a bad ending.

689
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,960
Someone remembered his name

690
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,400
and he returned to his master.

691
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,200
I think that rabbit

692
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,440
can only endure those hardships

693
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,480
because he knows you remember his name.

694
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,960
So

695
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,000
maybe this is Jiang Xiaoxi.

696
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,560
I don't want to be a burden to him.

697
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,720
You're a

698
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,320
person who can make others happy.

699
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,280
Such a person

700
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,120
will not have a bad ending.

701
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,680
Yes, he must be happy.

702
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,680
Drink.

703
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,160
There will never be a bad ending.

704
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,160
No, don't worry.

705
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,400
Wang Zhao.

706
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,800
Don't get up.

707
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,360
Drink.

708
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Drink.

709
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
I wish you a smooth journey.

710
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,120
I also wish you a smooth journey.

711
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,280
May everything go well.

712
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm sorry.

719
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm sorry.

720
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
I'm sorry.

721
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
I'm sorry.

724
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm sorry.

725
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm sorry.

726
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
I'm sorry.

728
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm sorry.

730
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm sorry.

731
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
I'm sorry.

732
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
I'm sorry.

733
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
I'm sorry.

734
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm sorry.

736
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I'm sorry.

738
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
I'm sorry.

739
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
I'm sorry.

740
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
I'm sorry.

741
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
I'm sorry.

742
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm sorry.

744
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm sorry.

745
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
I'm sorry.

746
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm sorry.

747
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
I'm sorry.

748
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm sorry.

749
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm sorry.

750
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
I'm sorry.

751
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I'm sorry.

752
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
I'm sorry.

753
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
I'm sorry.

754
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
I'm sorry.

755
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
I'm sorry.

756
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
I'm sorry.

757
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I'm sorry.

758
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
I'm sorry.

759
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
I'm sorry.

760
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm sorry.

761
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm sorry.

762
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
I'm sorry.

763
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm sorry.

764
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
I'm sorry.

765
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
I'm sorry.

766
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I'm sorry.

767
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm sorry.

768
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
I'm sorry.

769
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
I'm sorry.

770
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
I'm sorry.

771
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm sorry.

772
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I'm sorry.

773
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm sorry.

774
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
I'm sorry.

775
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm sorry.

776
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm sorry.

777
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm sorry.

778
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm sorry.

779
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm sorry.

780
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm sorry.

781
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I'm sorry.

782
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I'm sorry.

783
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
I'm sorry.

784
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm sorry.

785
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
I'm sorry.

786
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm sorry.

787
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I'm sorry.

788
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
I'm sorry.

789
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
I'm sorry.

790
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
I'm sorry.

791
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm sorry.

792
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm sorry.

793
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
I'm sorry.

794
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
I'm sorry.

795
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm sorry.

796
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
I'm sorry.

797
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
I'm sorry.

798
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
That ocean

799
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,440
No regrets can come out

800
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,440
This is the most true, most firm

801
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm with you

802
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Let's see the following words

803
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,760
He lead us to his carriage for a longer journey just in case.

804
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,920
Master Leng.

805
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,920
Get it up.

806
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,920
Chan Chan.

807
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,520
Here.

808
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
I don't want to go.

809
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,200
How about this?

810
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,680
I'll go and tell your parents

811
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,160
to let my brother play the violin again.

812
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,920
Mr. Luo, don't go.

813
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,480
They won't listen.

814
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
My brother is going to the competition

815
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,840
in a few days.

816
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,640
He practices there every day.

817
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,440
My parents like him too.

818
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,600
He can't make it.

819
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,880
Who said that?

820
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,120
My parents always ask me

821
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,480
how I'm doing today.

822
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,000
My parents care about you.

823
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,440
Chuan Chuan,

824
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
do you know

825
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,520
that my teacher has a friend?

826
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
He's like you.

827
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
He also has a brother.

828
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,400
Kids are always

829
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,320
compared to each other.

830
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,080
When we were young,

831
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
my friend

832
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,520
would also

833
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,720
suffer because of this.

834
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,200
What color do you like?

835
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
I haven't thought about it.

836
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,680
But I'm starting to like black.

837
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,320
What else?

838
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Think about something else.

839
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,200
I'll like it.

840
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,480
Red.

841
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
I like red.

842
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,360
Jiang Jiaxi,

843
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,520
next time I celebrate my birthday,

844
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,120
I'll make a wish for you.

845
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,360
I wish your parents

846
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,160
love you as you always do.

847
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,880
Okay?

848
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,440
What about your wish?

849
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,080
What's your wish?

850
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,640
My wish

851
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,440
is that we should be together.

852
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,960
We shouldn't be separated.

853
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,360
Then you should keep your wish.

854
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
For me,

855
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
this is more important.

856
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
Did he

857
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,600
compare his brother?

858
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,960
Later, when he grew up,

859
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,240
comparison is not important.

860
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,680
What's important is

861
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
to figure out

862
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,160
who you are

863
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
and what you really like.

864
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,800
I like to go to class with Mr. Yin Tao.

865
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,360
Mr. Yin Tao also likes to give Chunchun classes.

866
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,920
What a great kid.

867
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,040
He's only in the fourth grade.

868
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,400
He's so good at writing.

869
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,480
Maybe he'll become

870
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,520
a very good writer in the future.

871
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,600
Little writer,

872
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,440
you're writing a novel.

873
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,680
Come on.

874
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,200
Here.

875
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,880
You like it?

876
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,040
Mr. Yin Tao,

877
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,600
I suddenly feel

878
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,800
that this love story

879
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,640
is not noisy anymore.

880
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,320
Jiang Qiaoxi,

881
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,680
do you know?

882
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,400
The more I look at

883
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,600
the boy I taught, Chunchun,

884
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,160
the more I feel that he's like you.

885
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Did you need us

886
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,080
when you were very young?

887
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,400
The reinstation

888
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,680
Xiao'er,

889
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,880
are you going to the parks

890
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,680
tomorrow weekend?

891
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:24,880
OK.

892
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,240
Where do you use this hairht merk?

893
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,440
Why give it to me?

894
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,760
You don't need it anymore?

895
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,920
I don't need it.

896
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,960
The proportion of men and women in our school,

897
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,200
who should I show it to?

898
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,280
You don't need it,

899
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,640
so I need it.

900
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,360
Isn't your little hair in the hospital?

901
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,280
You go to find someone to eat every weekend.

902
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,640
We have too many conditions.

903
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,840
You two are in a hurry.

904
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,520
Don't say that.

905
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,720
I went to find Ying Tao,

906
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,320
not for this.

907
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,600
Okay, okay.

908
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,520
I said the wrong thing.

909
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,240
I said the wrong thing.

910
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,240
Hello?

911
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,800
Yu Qiao, go to the QQ.

912
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,880
Something big happened.

913
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,960
Why are you so excited?

914
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
The sky is falling.

915
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,920
It's worse than the sky falling.

916
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,600
This is what I found

917
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,040
on MSN Space.

918
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,040
It was sent by a girl who was in middle school in Hong Kong.

919
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,280
Is this Jiang Qiao Xi?

920
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,680
Am I right?

921
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,840
It seems to be Jiang Qiao Xi.

922
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,760
Do we need to tell Ying Tao?

923
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,720
Is it a good thing to tell Ying Tao?

924
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,600
Don't say anything.

925
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,640
Whoever dares to tell Ying Tao,

926
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,120
I'll tear his mouth off.

927
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,560
Do you hear me?

928
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,920
Yu Qiao, especially you.

929
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,680
Yu Qiao, are you done?

930
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,440
Now the sky is dark.

931
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,480
Only we can see it.

932
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,640
As long as we don't tell him,

933
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,920
Ying Tao won't know.

934
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,080
Why can't Ying Tao know?

935
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,920
Shouldn't Ying Tao know?

936
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,080
Who told you to pretend?

937
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,240
You're done, right?

938
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,680
I'm not done.

939
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm not done.

940
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm not done.

941
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
I'm not done.

942
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,480
You're done.

943
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,600
Yet nonsense.

944
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,080
Alleged , I'm really done.

945
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,080
Yu Qiao, what are you doing?

946
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,640
This one.

947
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,720
You guys.

948
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm sorry.

949
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,120
Hong Kong is far away.

950
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,400
You can't let him go alone.

951
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,160
There's no dark cloud.

952
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,240
It's just over a thousand miles away.

953
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,640
There's no extreme weather.

954
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,160
The weather is...

955
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,080
Yu Xiang, you're a good person.

956
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,480
You're going to Leshan, Sichuan by plane.

957
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,080
You'll land at the top of Leshan.

958
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,560
You'll be safe if you let him get up.

959
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,000
Memories float in the air.

960
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,760
They travel through time.

961
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,920
The cherry blossoms in summer are still bright.

962
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,400
I look far away.

963
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,160
The wishes I didn't say that year

964
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,240
are long because they are familiar.

965
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,960
Your outline is so gentle

966
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,000
beyond my sight.

967
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,640
The world is turning.

968
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,320
The breeze is blowing.

969
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,160
The scenery in the waterfall

970
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,160
is like yesterday.

971
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,440
The present is in front of me.

972
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,720
The future is in my hands.

973
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,240
You're lucky to who I am.

974
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,240
You're my dream.

975
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,240
You're my destiny.

976
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,240
You're my destiny.

977
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,240
You're my destiny.

978
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,240
You're my destiny.

979
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,240
You're my destiny.

980
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,240
You're my destiny.

981
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,240
You're my destiny.

982
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,240
You're my destiny.

983
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:22,240
The

984
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,240
The time in my palm

985
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,240
illuminates your face.

986
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,240
The smile that runs too fast

987
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:41,240
is accidentally kept.
