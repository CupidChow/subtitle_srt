00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To love To heal

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 10

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was in the park just now.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have something to say.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I came here

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
because there are some things

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that are between us.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I want to talk to you alone.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Go ahead.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In the palm that I sent you,

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from the beginning to the end,

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
there are no words like I like you.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How can this be called love?

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The original intention of me sending you the palm

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is that Chun Lu died.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Jiang Jia Xi,

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will let Chun Lu be your daughter, okay?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will call her Jiang Chun Lu.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Even if it is in the far, far away city,

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you must remember that

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you have a daughter.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Jiang Chun Lu,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
you will be Jiang Chun Lu in the future.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Be good and wait for me to come back.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are so childish, Jiang Jia Xi.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Chun Lu giving you as a daughter

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is the game of Guo Jia Jia.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Chun Lu is just my daughter.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It has nothing to do with you.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I originally just wanted to write a report,

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but I added some things about the group mountain later.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's because I remember that

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you said when you were young,

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you like the group mountain,

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you can't bear to leave the group mountain.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But in fact, I have the same concern

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
for all the children who come to the group mountain.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I have nothing special for you.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Actually, now that I think about it,

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
we were not very close at that time.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We just went to school together.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I forgot to learn that you were eating at my house,

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
writing homework, that's all.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Maybe I have done something special.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For example,

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
watching movies together,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
climbing the mountain together.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But these things,

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have played with Yu Qiao and Du Shang

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
many times.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can remember it just because

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
because when I was young,

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I had a very good memory.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But even if we have no relationship,

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you shouldn't show that hand to others.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because it's very rude,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
even mean.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And I decided to write a report

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to help you.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I also want to thank you

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
for your kindness.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And I decided to transfer to the middle school.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It has nothing to do with you.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's just because I need my friends.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And you,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you can't even count as a friend.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So from now on,

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
if we meet again,

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we just pretend not to know each other.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Just pretend that we never know each other.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can go.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Memory reflects-,

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the moon appears tomorrow

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
in the full light of the sun.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The roundness of the world is gentle

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,600
The world is turning

126
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
The breeze is blowing in my mind

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,640
The scenery in the fire

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
is like yesterday

129
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
The past is in front of us

130
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
If one day

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
we meet in summer

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll take a string of red to pick you up

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Be with me and be myself

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,800
You go

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,200
The sky is long

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
My stubbornness grows crazy

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
I can't stop running

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,600
The dream of life is calling

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,200
You're the key to all my dreams

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,400
Be with me and be yourself

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
The story is so beautiful

142
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
There's still someone

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,400
on such a basic problem

144
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
The law that appeared

145
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
This is very inappropriate

146
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
When you were successful, you were not good

147
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, let's move the book to page 52

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Cuz we're bothcoat

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,520
No home, no school, no profession

150
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,640
To master writing and master writing

151
00:08:49,640 --> 00:09:04,100
Prepare

152
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,920
She still remembers

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,840
to the big success.

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
Let's wish him

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,040
a bright future

156
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,960
in the College of Experimental Science.

157
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,320
Good luck.

159
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
There are still a lot of things.

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
There are not many things to see.

161
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,560
Why can't I

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
finish packing when I move?

163
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,560
Here.

164
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
Yin Tao, pack your things.

165
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,040
There are still your things down there.

166
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
Do you still want this?

167
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,480
Yes, yes, yes.

168
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
It's my favorite sandbag.

169
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,280
There are so many glass bottles.

170
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240
What are they for?

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
You still want this?

172
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
This is my unique instrument.

173
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,600
Do you remember?

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
You don't let me throw this

175
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
or throw that away.

176
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,720
It's a memento.

177
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,280
This...

178
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,840
Whose clothes are these?

179
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,680
Yin Tao, is this yours?

180
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,880
This?

181
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,720
I don't know.

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,120
Come at me.

183
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
By the way,

184
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
did Yin Tao ask you to come back?

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
You know why?

186
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,360
I want to stay.

187
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Didn't he tell you

188
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,800
I was going back to the capital with a pPh distributed.

189
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,040
I would be back once I kelp my winter vacation.

190
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,360
Chen Minghao's brother?

191
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
Sister Zhang Xiaochen.

192
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,720
I'll give it to you.

193
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,320
When I come back,

194
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
remember to return it to me.

195
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Isn't this the dress your cousin gave you?

196
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
It's such a precious thing.

197
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,840
You have to wear it in winter.

198
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
That's why I gave it to you.

199
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Jiang Jiaxi,

200
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,520
will you really come back?

201
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,240
Yes.

202
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Really?

203
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,720
Yes.

204
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,480
No.

205
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
I have to keep it.

206
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
I can't stand on it.

207
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,880
No?

208
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Think about it.

209
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
Throw it in this garbage bag.

210
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I really don't want it.

211
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,200
Jiulong.

212
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,880
Jiulong.

213
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,780
Jiulong.

214
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,860
Jiulong.

215
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
Jiulong.

216
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,520
Zhou 머리.

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,200
Zhou 머리.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,280
Zhou 머리.

219
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,000
Something is wrong.

220
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,840
Zhou".

221
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,320
Zhou sick!

222
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,400
Zhou sick!

223
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,560
Zhou!"

224
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,560
Goodbye

225
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,040
Goodbye

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,840
Mr. Fu, this building is close to you

227
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,440
Be careful

228
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,400
My house and Old Yu's house are in front

229
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,240
In the west

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
Of course, it's not far, not far

231
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
Just a road

232
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,840
Yes yes

233
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
See that little store

234
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,600
The first floor, Yu Yan's house

235
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,120
It's there

236
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm talking about the first floor

237
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
The first floor is where you switched with him

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,320
This first floor is the closest to the central square

239
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
You said it was you

240
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
It's okay, it's okay

241
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,040
Yes, the old Qin family's business is doing well

242
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,960
We are also happy

243
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
See this

244
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
We left the fourth floor for you

245
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,560
This house is more than others'

246
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,120
More windows that are close to the east

247
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
The lighting is particularly good

248
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,800
And the space at the door

249
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,280
Six more square meters

250
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,320
That's great

251
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
These dropped books

252
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
And something old

253
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,680
Now there's room for it

254
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,880
All we can do is live with him

255
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
Come on, fight

256
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,720
This this this

257
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,080
Dance machine dance machine

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,000
Dance machine

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,040
This Qu Z balance system has no

260
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,800
Very fun

261
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
You definitely like it

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't know

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,680
No no no

264
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,400
It's very simple

265
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
That little son

266
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,800
Your hand here

267
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,960
Hand here right

268
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,640
What is this

269
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Is here

270
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
Left foot. Right foot. Left foot.

271
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,680
Left foot. Right foot.

272
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,200
Right foot.

273
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,920
Right foot.

274
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,440
Nanen.

275
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,400
Slowly.

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,040
Slowly.

277
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,680
What do you mean by slowly? It's not fun at all.

278
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
Ying Tao, you can't do it.

279
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I can't?

280
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,000
When have you ever won me in a game?

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Did you win in the game of throw the sandbag?

282
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Did you win in the game of hit the wall?

283
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
Now you say I can't do it.

284
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Ying Tao,

285
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,160
how about we go back and throw sandbags?

286
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,520
We haven't played in the provincial city.

287
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,440
I'll call my mom.

288
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,800
Let her give us a gift now.

289
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,880
I can't jump alone.

290
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,040
I can't be embarrassed alone.

291
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
You two go up.

292
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm coming.

293
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,960
I...

294
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,800
Slow down, Ying Tao.

295
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
The house is so lively.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
You guys have really

297
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,920
lived a lot of good days behind my back.

298
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,440
Ying Tao,

299
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,840
you don't know that

300
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,080
when I first came here,

301
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,600
I thought you must like it here.

302
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
I was thinking

303
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
how fun it would be if you were here.

304
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,720
You can't be so naughty.

305
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,960
Look at her news.

306
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
What can you stop her from doing?

307
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
Is that white shirt a pair of glasses?

308
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,000
Someone sells it for ten yuan

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
for every dollar.

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
If you bring a bag of

311
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,440
treasure, you'll make a lot of money.

312
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,600
Thank you.

313
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,120
What are you doing?

314
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,800
What are you doing here?

315
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,040
You just saw it all.

316
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,600
It's bright.

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
Why are you just staring?

318
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,440
Buy whatever you want.

319
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm not hungry now.

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,560
If it's stable,

321
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,720
I can make money.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
But dear friend,

323
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
I have you as my

324
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
firewood.

325
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,840
You always sing a song with your heart.

326
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,240
So many stars.

327
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,680
Facing the sunset.

328
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,880
It's quite quiet

329
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
at the beach at night.

330
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,360
Right?

331
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm sorry.

334
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,560
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
I'm sorry.

338
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm sorry.

339
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm sorry.

354
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Mr. Lin.

363
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,480
Where are you going?

364
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,400
Where are you going?

365
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,640
I...

366
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,920
We bought you food.

367
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,280
Then why didn't you tell me?

368
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,600
Are you afraid of me?

369
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,360
No.

370
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,480
Mr. Lin.

371
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Mr. Lin.

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,480
What are you doing?

373
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
Hurry up.

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't see.

375
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,000
Lin Yingtao,

376
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,560
you have today.

377
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
You used to be the first one.

378
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,040
You found us first.

379
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,920
We're in different times.

380
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,680
Jialin is your territory.

381
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,600
You can take me there in the future.

382
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,880
What road?

383
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
Come to me whenever you want to come out.

384
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,480
Come to us.

385
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
We'll take you and take care of you.

386
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Right, Yingtao.

387
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,680
You're in the provincial city. We won't separate.

388
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,600
We'll be together wherever we go.

389
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,240
It's raining heavily in the city.

390
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm not romantic.

391
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,400
Actually,

392
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,040
I've never been lost

393
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,080
when I was alone in Qun Mountain.

394
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,480
Then,

395
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,440
you'll be lost only when you have someone around you.

396
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,400
Anyway, when there's no one around me,

397
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,320
I can see the road sign.

398
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
I can find the way back even if I ask for it.

399
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,720
Right.

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,880
What can stop you,

401
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,000
Lin Yingtao?

402
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:41,380
Lin Yingtao is a

403
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
real beauty.

404
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,400
I didn't say anything.

405
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,440
It's raining.

406
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,280
It's raining.

407
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,200
I didn't say anything.

408
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,920
Lin You Tao, wait for me.

409
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,440
The sun shines down,

410
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,720
and the warm kiss is warm.

411
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,560
Look at the prince riding the white horse.

412
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
Lin You Tao, run!

413
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,200
Yu Qiao.

414
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,520
What are you doing?

415
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
Lin You Tao.

416
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,440
Open your eyes.

417
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,360
What?

418
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,280
Run!

419
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
Let me go!

420
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,600
Run! Run!

421
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
Help me!

422
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,600
Thank you!

423
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,040
Lin You Tao, run!

424
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,600
Nine-eyes-man!

425
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
Why are you running?

426
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,280
halfway to the ship.

427
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,320
Come!

428
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
As there's heavy demon conditioning on the sea of medical records,

429
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm bound to say goodbye.

430
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,660
...are a tree with chaos

431
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,040
and I'm on my way to MLP

432
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,700
Lin Feng

433
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,020
What's happening?

434
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm here

435
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,120
Like yesterday, enjoy the moment

436
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,900
This past life

437
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,880
Kissing the desert

438
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,420
I just want to struggle with you

439
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,540
With clouded hope

440
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,940
Look over there.

441
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,180
Please look over there.

442
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,420
He just fainted.

443
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,380
Just move.

444
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,620
I will check.

445
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,340
There.

446
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,980
There.

447
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,860
Yes.

448
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,660
Are you sure you could get through?

449
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,860
How?

450
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Can you take it first?

451
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,940
I can't take it.

452
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,340
Come on.

453
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,900
I want you to check the cream we have given you.

454
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,940
So I can flip your cake.

455
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,460
Go.

456
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,140
Do it.

457
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,780
Yes.

458
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,060
No doubts.

459
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,060
Class 18, Class 18 of science class.

460
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,780
Me?

461
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,740
Who else?

462
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,420
Me.

463
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,300
Who else?

464
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,740
I'm in Class 17 of science class.

465
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,100
Qingye is in Class 4 of science class.

466
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,540
No need to worry.

467
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,900
We can pick up water together next time.

468
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,180
Wang Yuan.

469
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm in Class 18 too.

470
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,100
You...

471
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,060
So great.

472
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,660
Are you a smarty?

473
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,820
Why are you so happy?

474
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,420
I have to ask my dad

475
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,220
to change me a better computer

476
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,140
for display.

477
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,420
I got such a good grade.

478
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,380
Are you going to bow to me?

479
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,060
If you were my son,

480
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,020
I would sell you.

481
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,900
When will you stop being self-righteous?

482
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,940
Now,

483
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,180
you can't even play CS.

484
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,420
What else?

485
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,500
What?

486
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,380
Who else in Class 18?

487
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,940
You can see for yourself.

488
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,420
Excuse me.

489
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,300
Excuse me, Miss.

490
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,140
Excuse me.

491
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,980
Excuse me.

492
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,780
Excuse me.

493
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,900
Excuse me.

494
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,740
Excuse me.

495
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,060
Class 1 award.

496
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,540
Jiang Qiaoxi, where is Class 1 award?

497
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,020
Jiang Qiaoxi got the right to be the examiner.

498
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,580
Congratulations.

499
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,300
Congratulations.

500
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,820
Excuse me.

501
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,340
Thank you.

502
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,020
It's her.

503
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,700
She is Lin Qi Lu.

504
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,740
Do you remember?

505
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,340
I thought she was the flower girl

506
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,580
who wrote a letter to Jiang Qiaoxi.

507
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,020
I didn't expect her to get the 47th place in the exam.

508
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,700
She is quite good at being our classmate.

509
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,180
Do you want to say hello?

510
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,460
She is in the same class as Qu Shan.

511
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,340
I guess they are the same class.

512
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,380
Lin Qi Lu.

513
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,900
Is it true?

514
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,620
Yes.

515
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,260
Yes.

516
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,940
Yes.

517
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
It's really you.

518
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,380
Class monitor.

519
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,580
I just saw your name on the list.

520
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,180
I thought it was the same name.

521
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,260
Master.

522
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,420
I am Lin Qi Lu.

523
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,140
I was the class monitor in Qu Shan.

524
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,580
We are all 18th class classmates from now on.

525
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,340
She just transferred to another school.

526
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,580
She is a little shy.

527
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,780
I hope you can take care of her.

528
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,820
Shy?

529
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,380
Did you get the wrong person?

530
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,020
She needs to be taken care of.

531
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,140
I don't know her.

532
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,820
We don't know her either.

533
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,460
I almost forgot.

534
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,020
You are also from Qu Shan.

535
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,740
You know each other.

536
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,580
Yes.

537
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,820
That's great.

538
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,700
Well.

539
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,220
You can integrate into the new environment quickly.

540
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,300
Class monitor Feng, you are still so enthusiastic.

541
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,180
I am also a foreign student.

542
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,460
I am so happy.

543
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,060
Why don't you wait for me?

544
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,340
Let's go to have dinner later.

545
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,380
No, no, no.

546
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,580
You can go ahead.

547
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,300
We have to go home.

548
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,100
See you in class.

549
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,580
Don't mind her.

550
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,540
She is very shy.

551
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,940
Goodbye, class monitor.

552
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,780
See you.

553
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,740
Class monitor.

554
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,060
Class monitor.

555
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,980
Let's go.

556
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,060
Let's go.

557
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,580
Actually, you don't have to watch it.

558
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,900
You must be the first one.

559
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,380
Did you see the commendation

560
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,820
on the red line?

561
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,540
I didn't notice.

562
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,300
Your class monitor Sun values you very much.

563
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,900
This news has been posted

564
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,980
before the school began.

565
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,060
Your class monitor told me

566
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,540
that she has two new babies.

567
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,300
One is the statue of the old man

568
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,380
in your school.

569
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,420
The other one is you.

570
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,020
Erzi,

571
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,620
do you remember the girl

572
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,020
from the Lin family?

573
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
Her name is Ying Tao.

574
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,020
You used to eat at her house when you were a kid.

575
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,820
That girl also got into your school.

576
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,020
She is quite hardworking.

577
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,260
I heard that she got good grades

578
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
and got a degree in science.

579
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,300
She might be in the same class as you.

580
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,380
I am not from the same class.

581
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,460
I saw her name on the monitor.

582
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,900
Your mother happened to be in Lai Shui.

583
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Dad booked a room in the hotel.

584
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,460
I want to be the host.

585
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,860
Dad, you can get into the provincial team

586
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,300
and she can get into the experimental medical school.

587
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,620
We can get together

588
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,820
and have a good time together.

589
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,500
Think about it.

590
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,860
When we were in Qunshan,

591
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,420
we always bothered her.

592
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,700
And she treats you well.

593
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,380
I think...

594
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,060
I will go.

595
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,780
Okay.

596
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,940
Ying Tao.

597
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,500
Mom.

598
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,340
I am thinking that

599
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,740
we should treat you to dinner tonight.

600
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,540
If you don't want to go,

601
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,300
you don't have to go.

602
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,100
It's okay.

603
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,540
If that's the case,

604
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,540
will you and dad be embarrassed?

605
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,300
It's okay.

606
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
You don't have to worry about it.

607
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,140
It's just a relationship

608
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,980
between adults.

609
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,420
After you clean up,

610
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,700
you can rest at home.

611
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,420
Mom.

612
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,260
I will go.

613
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,100
I have no reason not to go.

614
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Let's have a drink later.

615
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,260
Okay.

616
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,860
Coming.

617
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,460
Sorry.

618
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
I am late.

619
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Sorry.

620
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,100
We were late when we were cleaning up.

621
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

622
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,700
Thank you.

623
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
You are not late.

624
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,300
The dishes are not ready yet.

625
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,100
Ying Tao.

626
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,300
Uncle Jiang.

627
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,100
You are better.

628
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,300
With such good grades,

629
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,700
you got into the experimental medical school.

630
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I think you should go.

631
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,300
I will go.

632
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:13,900
Okay.

633
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,300
I suggest you stay here

634
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,700
and study in Beijing.

635
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,700
Okay.

636
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Everyone is here.

637
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,500
Let's sit down.

638
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,300
Okay.

639
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,900
This way, please.

640
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,300
Come on.

641
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,100
Let's sit down.

642
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,900
The girl is here.

643
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
The man is here.

644
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,700
The man is here.

645
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,100
Jiang Xin.

646
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,500
Come on.

647
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Sit over there.

648
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,100
Ying Tao.

649
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,700
You sit here.

650
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,100
Ying Tao, you sit here.

651
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,300
Sit here.

652
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,900
Today,

653
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,500
you two are the leading roles.

654
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,100
You haven't seen each other for so many years.

655
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,900
Let's get to know each other again today.

656
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,100
Jiang Xin, take care of Ying Tao.

657
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,700
Okay.

658
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,300
Sit down.

659
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,700
Sit down.

660
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,700
Sit down.

661
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,500
Today,

662
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
we have two kids.

663
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,100
One of them got into the experimental medical school.

664
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,300
The other one got the first prize in the Olympic Games.

665
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,100
Thank you.

666
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,300
I also wish all the kids

667
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,900
to be successful in the future

668
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
and to be healthy and happy.

669
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,700
Let's have a toast.

670
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,100
Okay.

671
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Cheers.

672
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,500
Thank you.

673
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,300
Cheers.

674
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,500
Come on.

675
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,300
Let's eat.

676
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,900
Come on.

677
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
You are welcome.

678
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Come on.

679
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,500
Lin,

680
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,700
I remember that

681
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,100
Ying Tao

682
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
didn't like studying when he was a kid.

683
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,700
He liked to take his kids

684
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,900
to the heaven and earth.

685
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
When the final exam was about to start,

686
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
he would take Fang Yuan and the others

687
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,700
to hide from the adults.

688
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,900
He was afraid that the adults would ask.

689
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,500
What does it mean now?

690
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
It means that Ying Tao is still smart.

691
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
As long as he works hard,

692
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
he will get into the exam.

693
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,900
Qiao Xin is also excellent.

694
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,300
The first place in the Olympic Games.

695
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,100
It's not

696
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
a result that can be achieved by hard work.

697
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,100
I remember that time,

698
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,300
Ying Tao and Qiao Xin

699
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,900
were always together.

700
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,500
It's not Ying Tao who follows Qiao Xin,

701
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,100
but Qiao Xin follows Ying Tao.

702
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
One day,

703
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,900
Ying Tao went to my house to get fried shrimp chips.

704
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
He was there,

705
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,100
and didn't leave for a long time.

706
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Then he told me,

707
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Aunt Kang,

708
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
you should give Qiao Xin a piece of it.

709
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
I remember this.

710
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,900
Yes,

711
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,500
we used to eat this.

712
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
We used to like to eat this.

713
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,300
Right.

714
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,900
Lin,

715
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,700
you should try it.

716
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,100
Come on.

717
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,900
Yes.

718
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,700
You two should try it.

719
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,300
Come on.

720
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,100
Let's drink.

721
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,700
Come on.

722
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,300
Cheers.

723
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,900
Thank you.

724
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,900
Cheers.

725
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Come on.

726
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,700
Congratulations.

727
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,900
This is great.

728
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,700
It's great.

729
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,300
It's great.

730
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,100
Ying Tao,

731
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,900
eat the crab.

732
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Come on, I'll help you.

733
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
I can do it myself.

734
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,700
Lu Shao,

735
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,900
you should change it.

736
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
In the future,

737
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
we can't call her Ying Tao

738
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
or Ying Tao.

739
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,300
We should call her Lin Qi Le.

740
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Lin Qi Le?

741
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,500
What are you doing?

742
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
It's so strange.

743
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,900
I've never been called that before.

744
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,100
It's so strange.

745
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,300
Just call me Lin Ying Tao.

746
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,500
Just call me Lin Ying Tao.

747
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
I'm Lin Ying Tao.

748
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
Eat this.

749
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,500
Eat the crab with this.

750
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,300
You...

751
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,100
I'm so sorry.

752
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,500
Please.

753
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
That...

754
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,000
I need to study more

755
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,040
Well

756
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,360
In the future, in the school

757
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,540
You should call yourself Lin Qile

758
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,580
Don't let people call you Lin Y Freud

759
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:01,940
Classmate

760
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,480
it doesn't matter what I called you

761
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,440
in the magazine

762
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,700
withhell meanwhile.

763
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,020
Do you think

764
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,720
I don't need you

765
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,340
in my relationships.

766
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,840
That's a Closed Number.

767
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,580
You'll say this to me

768
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,440
and I will explain to the director.

769
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,520
Your husband

770
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,440
also doesn't keep others wheel.

771
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,100
If you do this,

772
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
It's not good.

773
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,860
Yes.

774
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,740
I know you.

775
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,540
It's not good for me.

776
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,140
Fine.

777
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,140
No, I...

778
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,220
The fish in the restaurant we ate is very delicious.

779
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,900
My mom said you must like it.

780
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,300
So I opened another one

781
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,260
and packed the fish for you and Qin Ye Yun.

782
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,500
Thank you.

783
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,380
Thank you, Ms. Ying.

784
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm really sorry.

785
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,700
My legs hurt a lot today.

786
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,980
I didn't attend your and Qiao Xi's celebration.

787
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,180
Don't blame me.

788
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,620
What are you talking about?

789
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,460
You gave us all the food in our new house.

790
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,580
My parents also asked me to thank you.

791
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,340
Is Qin Ye Yun home?

792
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,300
Yes.

793
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,460
She just came to my house.

794
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,300
Yun Yun.

795
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,700
Yun Yun.

796
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
Qin Ye Yun.

797
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,020
Qin Ye Yun.

798
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,100
What are you doing, Lin Yitang?

799
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,540
You look so good, Qin Ye Yun.

800
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,820
You look like a...

801
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,540
monster.

802
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,500
Lin Yitang.

803
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,220
You used to be a sweet-talker.

804
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,620
Why are you wearing a dirty one now?

805
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,260
Your question is too sharp.

806
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,060
Change another one.

807
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,260
You're good at writing.

808
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,660
Why did you choose Li Ke?

809
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,620
I like Li Ke.

810
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,780
You?

811
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,300
You like Li Ke?

812
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,660
Does Li Ke like you?

813
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,060
Why can he talk about games?

814
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,500
I can't.

815
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,940
Who said he talked about Qiao Xi?

816
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,460
Yes.

817
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,660
Don't mention him.

818
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,620
You said it first.

819
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,700
Actually, he's like this now.

820
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,500
You should have told me earlier.

821
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,820
Now, Ke Hao

822
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,900
is like a fool.

823
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,300
He wrote such a long letter to her.

824
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,580
He's so obsessed with her.

825
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,540
Like a fool.

826
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm afraid that

827
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:09,860
he should just media board going

828
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,100
like a Tiger-like pig.

829
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,580
You crossed the line to manipulate my heart.

830
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,180
How could you concentration yourself like that?

831
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
I just want to let myself remember

832
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
that he is no longer the Jiang Qiao Xin I used to know.

833
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,340
I won't treat him like I used to.

834
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,860
I will never forgive him.

835
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,900
Meng Mei.

836
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,820
It's messy.

837
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,060
It's fun. It's like a net.

838
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
Let me cut it for you.

839
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,660
Don't move.

840
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,540
Most of the students here

841
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,260
are from Class 21.

842
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,020
We've known each other before.

843
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,660
This is the new student

844
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,500
who just transferred to our lab.

845
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,020
Let's get to know each other.

846
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,660
Hello, everyone.

847
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,140
My name is Lin Qi Le.

848
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,940
I'm from Class 11.

849
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,700
It's my pleasure to be your classmate.

850
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,900
Please take care of me.

851
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,460
That's great.

852
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,420
Listen.

853
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,980
Let's sit at the same table.

854
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,500
If you have any questions,

855
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,820
just come to me.

856
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
Thank you, monitor.

857
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,260
I'm still the monitor.

858
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm glad you helped me.

859
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,460
The most cherished recollection

860
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,220
that graced the annals of your memory.

861
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,340
Raise your hand

862
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,180
if you know the meaning of this sentence.

863
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,660
Well, last year,

864
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,300
I won a basketball game

865
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,540
and I carried my classmates.

866
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,340
I almost got some crazy fans.

867
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,500
So, I'm so proud of that.

868
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,100
Okay.

869
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,020
I think that's a joke.

870
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,700
Sit down, please.

871
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
Who else

872
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,780
would like to try this practice?

873
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,060
Try it.

874
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Be brave.

875
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,500
Lin Qi Le.

876
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,060
Anyone would like to

877
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,660
practice with Lin Qi Le?

878
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,580
Be careful.

879
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,460
Okay?

880
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
Yeah, I can.

881
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,660
The most cherished recollection

882
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,180
that graced the annals of your memory.

883
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,940
Nice to see you, Lin Qi Le.

884
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,980
Well, go on.

885
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,380
In a chapter of my life's narrative,

886
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,940
a friend once led me to the mountain's crest

887
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,140
to behold the splendor of the evening's

888
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,460
resplendent hues.

889
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,460
And as it was there,

890
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,940
the essence of my name

891
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,620
was pointedly infused

892
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,300
with the meaning of the vibrant sunset

893
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,740
by a companion of profound insight.

894
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
I'm sorry.

895
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,060
I don't understand what you're meaning.

896
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,780
It's okay, Lin Qi Le.

897
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,260
Jiang Xiao Xi's English is really good.

898
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,460
She used a lot of words.

899
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,100
Actually, for a senior high school student,

900
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,500
this is already a super-high-level.

901
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Please sit down.

902
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Jiang Xiao Xi.

903
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,100
Can you translate it?

904
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,260
Yes, I can.

905
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,580
In my life's narrative,

906
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,140
I've been thinking about

907
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,780
a friend once led me to the mountain's crest

908
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,380
to behold the splendor of the evening's

909
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,420
resplendent hues.

910
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,820
In a chapter of my life's narrative,

911
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,460
a friend once led me to the mountain's crest

912
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,260
to behold the splendor of the evening's

913
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
resplendent hues.

914
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,860
Look.

915
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,740
The Chinese characters point to the 795th page.

916
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,940
The second sound means the high and the low.

917
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,660
This is the west side of the highest mountain

918
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,500
with a reddish hue.

919
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,900
It's very bright.

920
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,700
I think that means

921
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,580
Jiang Xiao Xi's name.

922
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,860
The meaning of Jiang Xiao Xi's name is very good.

923
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,740
It sounds nice too.

924
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,940
Jiang Xiao Xi.

925
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,820
Look.

926
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,220
I'll shout out the name

927
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,100
and then smile.

928
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,660
Jiang Xiao Xi.

929
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,060
Jiang Xiao Xi.

930
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,380
It's really there.

931
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,340
My name

932
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,860
was given to Cai Xia by a friend

933
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,180
who has a good sense of direction.

934
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,980
Very good.

935
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,580
Sit down, please.

936
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,620
Teacher He.

937
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,020
Please.

938
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,180
I'm sorry.

939
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,460
I just realized

940
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,980
that I said something wrong.

941
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,900
Lin Qi Le and I

942
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,100
should use

943
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,780
nice to meet you.

944
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,500
This is the first sentence

945
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,780
when we first met.

946
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,700
But I just used

947
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,860
nice to see you.

948
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,140
This sentence

949
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,220
is generally used to repeat the meeting.

950
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,220
I'm very happy

951
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,020
to see you again.

952
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,580
Okay.

953
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,500
Please sit down.

954
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,740
He was right.

955
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,580
The meaning of these two sentences

956
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,700
is to show that

957
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,900
I'm very happy to see you.

958
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,820
But the first sentence

959
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,580
is used in a formal occasion.

960
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,700
The second sentence is used in an unofficial occasion.

961
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,660
We are now opening the textbook.

962
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
It's okay, Lin Qi Le.

963
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
The learning is very hard.

964
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,700
I don't know what he's talking about.

965
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,740
It's not embarrassing.

966
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,900
What do you mean?

967
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,340
Why are you so hard?

968
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,540
I can't forget you.

969
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Or I don't want you to forget him.

970
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,340
Or you can forget him.

971
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,220
It's written in the young books.

972
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Do you think I can talk to you?

973
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Xiao Xiao Xi.

974
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,220
Who is the person

975
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,220
you told to say in English class?

976
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
An important person.

977
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,540
Do you think they are

978
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,220
very talented and brave?

979
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Do you think they are very popular?

980
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
Du Huo.

981
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,220
I think you are very popular.

982
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,220
Lu Huo.

983
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,220
It's none of my business.

984
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,820
But isn't your name

985
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,220
a poem?

986
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,100
Wan Hu, Qian Men, Jiang Qiang Xi.

987
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,220
They are all beautiful and powerful.

988
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,220
I don't like them.

989
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,220
Actually, I like to watch the sunset too.

990
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,220
If you have time,

991
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
let's go to the beach together.

992
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,820
I may not have time.

993
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Classmate.

994
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,220
I just forgot to take the water card.

995
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,220
Can I borrow yours?

996
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,220
Are we very familiar?

997
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,820
I forgot to introduce myself

998
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,220
when I was practicing English.

999
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,020
My name is Jiang Qiang Xi.

1000
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,220
Nice to meet you.

1001
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,220
I'm not too happy.

1002
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,220
And I don't

1003
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
want to borrow your water card.

1004
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,220
Look at the moon,

1005
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,220
the prince rides the white horse.

1006
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
Looking at the sky,

1007
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,220
the distant clouds are not speaking.

1008
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
The quiet boat

1009
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,220
is waiting for an answer.

1010
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,220
The green night,

1011
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,220
gently caresses my face.

1012
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,220
The shy past

1013
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,220
is gone.

1014
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,220
The blue sky,

1015
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,220
the pieces of yearning are lying in the grass.

1016
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,220
Unexpectedly,

1017
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,220
the moon is standing beside me.

1018
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
The sun will rise,

1019
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,220
and the moon will say goodbye.

1020
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
A little cat

1021
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,220
is walking with me.

1022
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Many years have passed,

1023
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,220
the appearance of the past is blurred.

1024
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,220
I hold a pen on my finger

1025
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,220
and draw a little magic.

1026
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,220
I sing with you

1027
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,220
on the hill.

1028
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:42,220
We met by accident.

1029
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
I want to hold you

1030
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,220
like a mountain.

1031
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,220
The sun is about to rise.

1032
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,220
You are in my eyes.

1033
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
I look at you,

1034
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,220
and you are in my mind.

1035
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,220
At this moment,

1036
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
I understand

1037
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,220
peace and freedom.
