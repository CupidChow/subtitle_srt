Episode 1

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Lin Yitong.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you here alone?

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm asking you.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't want to go with him.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Who?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No one. It's not important.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're so angry with someone who is not important?

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who is it?

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll call Jiang Xiaoxi.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let him comfort me.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why should you call him?

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My own business

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
has nothing to do with him.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Tell me.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why did Jiang Xiaoxi make you angry?

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why doesn't she answer my call?

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jiang Xiaoxi, what's wrong with you?

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nothing.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She said she wants to go somewhere.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Did she say where she wanted to go?

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,240
Jiang Xiaoxi.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
No.

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
Jiang Xiaoxi.

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,040
Sorry, Jiang Xiaoxi.

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,800
I didn't know you didn't tell Lin Xing

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
that you were going to study abroad.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
You're going to study abroad?

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
Why didn't we know?

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Did Ying Tao know?

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
You didn't tell Ying Tao either.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,840
How could Feng Letian know?

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,960
You should let Ying Tao

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,000
know that you're going to study abroad from Feng Letian's mouth.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
I heard it in the teacher's office.

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Jiang Xiaoxi, you...

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
Do you know what Ying Tao is most afraid of?

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,080
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,680
What does his business have to do with me?

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,720
He doesn't want to talk, so he doesn't talk.

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
Anyway, I'm used to it.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,240
We've been like this since we were young.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
He and I are just

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,880
friends who eat at my house recently.

51
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
We're in the same school.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,040
We're neighbors at home.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,560
Really?

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Maybe.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,680
Maybe Jiang Xiaoxi thinks so.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,600
But I promise you, you won't think so.

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,160
I think so.

58
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,840
I've seen it very clearly.

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,720
My relationship with him

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,920
is the same as your relationship with him.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,120
If you think so,

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
what are you angry about?

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
He didn't tell me.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,680
Look at me.

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,160
Don't I look angry?

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,000
Where are you going?

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,360
With whom?

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,520
I....

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,520
Hello.

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
Even that totally seems meaningless.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,840
Alright, I got it.

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
Wait in Beijing

73
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,200
Jawed by the rowan

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,180
Cigrints

75
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,260
A bunch of

76
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,140
tourists

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,820
We also met

78
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,220
The old wine

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,000
I haven't eaten

80
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,020
Can you give it to me

81
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,140
Give it to me

82
00:05:48,140 --> 00:06:13,980
Put some

83
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,460
Are you hungry?

84
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,420
Let's ask the playwrights to join us

85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,400
Enjoy it.

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:40,340
We're just talking about

87
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,140
Mr. Lei,

88
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,780
Beef.

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,540
I'll do it.

90
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,980
Eat it.

91
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,580
You eat it.

92
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,580
I'll eat the meat.

93
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,300
I'll eat it.

94
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,820
Do you think

95
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,700
the beef is better than home-cooked ones?

96
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,420
It's not bad.

97
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,740
How about this?

98
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,060
Here, the cucumber.

99
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,100
If you go abroad,

100
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,060
you'll have less chances to eat cold dishes.

101
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,780
Ying Tao.

102
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,380
I know you're mad at me.

103
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,300
I'm not.

104
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,620
If I were you,

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,820
I'd be mad too.

106
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,460
But I'm not...

107
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,300
If you're mad,

108
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,420
why are you still doing this?

109
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,780
See what I mean.

110
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,820
Jiang Tao Xingyi didn't tell us.

111
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,140
Right?

112
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,100
I don't know about it.

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,020
Neither do we.

114
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
I didn't hear about it.

115
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,140
We don't know it either.

116
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,620
That's right.

117
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,460
When I used to look at you,

118
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
I thought about it.

119
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,900
But in fact,

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,340
everything has been arranged.

121
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
You just didn't tell us,

122
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,460
right?

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,980
Yes.

124
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,140
Just like you gave up

125
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,700
all the time in the beginning.

126
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,580
You didn't tell us.

127
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,340
It's okay. I can understand.

128
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,940
But now you're going to study abroad.

129
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,780
We know it from others' mouth.

130
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,220
Do you know what it means to me?

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,340
It means

132
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,380
it's not important to you.

133
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,700
You have your own plan.

134
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
You have so many ideas and plans.

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,420
But I always thought you need me

136
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,380
and their support.

137
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
But in fact,

138
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,260
even without us,

139
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
you're still Jiang Tao Xi.

140
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
Without you,

141
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,180
I'm Lin Ying Tao.

142
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,060
Du Shang is also Du Shang.

143
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,820
Right?

144
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,220
Eat now.

145
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,740
Eat.

146
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Eat.

147
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,580
How much is the car?

148
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,460
120 yuan.

149
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,420
Hello, Mingkang.

150
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,420
Mingkang.

151
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,940
Mingkang.

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,900
Mingkang.

153
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,780
Wait till I'm done.

154
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,980
Just say it.

155
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,500
Say it.

156
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,540
Going to study abroad is my thought.

157
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,860
When I was in Qun Mountain,

158
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,660
I've made this decision.

159
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,620
And this decision

160
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,980
will never change.

161
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,260
You made this decision when you were in Qun Mountain?

162
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,300
Jiang Qiao Xi,

163
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,740
you hid from me for eight years

164
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,100
for such a big plan.

165
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
In these eight years, you have countless chances

166
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,340
to tell me that you...

167
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,220
You ate so much at my house.

168
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,340
You ate so much at my mom's house.

169
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,940
You didn't tell me about my family and the breakfast bun.

170
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,500
My parents were so worried about you these days.

171
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,340
My dad is so ungrateful.

172
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,060
He tried to reason with you.

173
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,260
And you didn't tell him.

174
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,460
You just kept it from him.

175
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,340
He never told me about my dad.

176
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,260
You lied to me.

177
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,700
You think our family is a joke, right?

178
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,860
Mingkang, you have to go with me.

179
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,540
Three years.

180
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,460
Two years at the earliest.

181
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,740
I'll take you with me.

182
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,420
It's a matter after seventeen years.

183
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,060
In the future,

184
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,100
we'll talk about it.

185
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,580
Are you serious?

186
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,420
Yes.

187
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,260
China

188
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,220
So...

189
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,580
And you didn't mean to hide it from me,

190
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,820
didn't want to tell me it's the last time,

191
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,820
You want me to go with you?

192
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,820
You want me to stay?

193
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,820
You want me to stay?

194
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
You should go.

195
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Will you go with me?

196
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I haven't thought about it.

197
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
But no matter what,

198
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,820
my path seems to be gone.

199
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,820
But Jiang Qiao Xi, you should fly out.

200
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,820
You will fly very high and very far.

201
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
No matter where I go,

202
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
you must come to me.

203
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
I will definitely come to pick you up.

204
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
We should at most separate and break up.

205
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Break up time.

206
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
You don't move at all?

207
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Of course I want to be with him.

208
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,820
But he has his own things to do.

209
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I have my own things to do.

210
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,820
And I know he is actually afraid.

211
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
But he is going abroad in the future.

212
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
What about you two?

213
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Anyway, he told me what he thought.

214
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
I also told him what I thought.

215
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
I don't know what's going to happen next.

216
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
I will take a step at a time.

217
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
You are so good.

218
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
In this case,

219
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
you should prepare for your college entrance examination.

220
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
You are not like him.

221
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
You have so many things to learn.

222
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
I think he has nothing to learn.

223
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Go.

224
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
peanuts

225
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,340
Being in conceived soundly I'll keep waiting for him to answer

226
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,140
Be Incorrect

227
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,060
Here you go

228
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,460
A blue sky makes us day vast

229
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,940
Laying in the grass

230
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,780
I see him.

231
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,420
He's series out in real life.

232
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,660
Also,

233
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,060
Tsier is in the hide.

234
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,420
No wonder she還有身穿皮 Three of you

235
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,260
Are together.

236
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,340
Brother-in-law,

237
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,220
Zeyi is young.

238
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,780
He may be camped in railway station for short career.

239
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,660
I want you see.

240
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,380
I want you see the reaction together.

241
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,500
Zeyi don't want it.

242
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,660
I won't leave again.

243
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,380
You seem a arbitrationinger.

244
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,980
I have to try abroad.

245
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,260
But this time I have no choice.

246
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,900
I will seduce you every time I see you.

247
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,780
You're like a cat and I'm like a wolf

248
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,220
How many times does B mean?

249
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
M can be just one time

250
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,540
Actually the question is

251
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,420
When the AP reaches what degree?

252
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,380
AP power will be just right to Mg

253
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,580
So we just have to calculate the formula of Mg and F

254
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,500
Then we can get to the love

255
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,380
Question

256
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,260
You see

257
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,580
The formula he gave

258
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:27,060
Ay

259
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,900
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,700
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,900
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,300
I'm so sorry.

291
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,420
I'm so sorry.

292
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,620
Here has something I want to tell you.

293
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,140
I need to call you,

294
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,780
and then I'll come to your flat inスイート.(It's slowly becoming night and popular around the city.)

295
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,660
There's no need

296
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,300
to speak to me the same way

297
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,380
you talk to me.

298
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
You have to speak like a father to me.

299
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,300
You have to speak like a father to me.

300
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,380
Don't speak too snippy.

301
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,220
It's the exam remember my parents.

302
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,980
My parents would say

303
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,460
my parents were more considerate.

304
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,300
I'm not.

305
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,260
Whatever.

306
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,580
It's not like you, Lin.

307
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,820
What's wrong?

308
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,900
Are you in a bad mood?

309
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,060
Did Jiang Qiaoxi make you angry again?

310
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,700
I'm not.

311
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,900
She's going to Hong Kong for her entrance exam soon.

312
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
If she doesn't go,

313
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,540
I don't think she'll come back.

314
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,820
Who says she won't come back?

315
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,340
Of course.

316
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,180
The exam is over.

317
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,740
According to the rules,

318
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,660
she should have left long ago.

319
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,980
If she doesn't come back,

320
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,540
she won't rent the house.

321
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,020
Rent the house?

322
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,300
You don't know?

323
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,220
She's renting the house.

324
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,700
That day, she came to my house

325
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,340
and posted the rent information.

326
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,100
She told my dad and Mrs. Shuang Yan

327
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,820
to keep an eye on her.

328
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,900
Why would she rent the house?

329
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Didn't she live with you?

330
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,740
It seems that Jiang Qiaoxi's mom

331
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,020
is starting to get angry again.

332
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,860
I think she can't stay at home anymore.

333
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,380
But she wants to stay with you longer.

334
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,340
I should have known

335
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,900
what she would face if she stayed.

336
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,380
Here.

337
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,020
The vermicelli is hot, right?

338
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,940
Is the fire burning?

339
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,620
I'll drink this.

340
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,340
I'll drink this.

341
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,340
It's okay. It's a small fire.

342
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,020
Come on. Try it.

343
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,780
It's delicious and hot.

344
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,700
Friends,

345
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,340
do you know why I called you here today?

346
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Because I have something to discuss with you.

347
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm thinking

348
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,140
if we should take her back to Qunshan together.

349
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,500
Back to Qunshan?

350
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,340
The construction site there has been demolished.

351
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,980
I'm afraid we can't find the way back.

352
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,420
The school hasn't been demolished yet.

353
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,420
I heard that

354
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,860
the school hasn't been demolished yet.

355
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,220
Only the students are not in class.

356
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,340
If you want to go back, go back.

357
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,020
I've always wanted to go back and see it.

358
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,820
Go back.

359
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,100
The train is now passing by.

360
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,140
It will arrive at two o'clock.

361
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,140
We'll leave early tomorrow.

362
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,020
We'll be back at night.

363
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,060
Back to Qunshan.

364
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,820
Open the door.

365
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,780
Back to Qunshan.

366
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Back to Qunshan.

367
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,820
Back to Qunshan.

368
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,900
Back to Qunshan.

369
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,860
Back to Qunshan.

370
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,780
Back to Qunshan.

371
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,300
Back to Qunshan.

372
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,460
Back to Qunshan.

373
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,220
We're here!

374
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,980
Let's go back.

375
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,540
Let's go back.

376
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,260
Let's go.

377
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,140
Are you familiar with this place?

378
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,020
Do you remember this place?

379
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,100
Tai Feng Yuan.

380
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,020
You must remember this place.

381
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,820
That time,

382
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,220
Uncle Cai took slippers

383
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,300
and drove you back to the construction site

384
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,860
through the game hall.

385
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,260
Lin Yitang, how dare you say that?

386
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
Don't pretend that you don't know.

387
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,860
You are the one who is cheating on me.

388
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,660
It's all your fault.

389
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,260
You had to bring Jiang Yao Ji here.

390
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,060
You didn't learn well and left her behind.

391
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,260
Lin Yitang, don't think Jiang Yao Ji is too good.

392
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
Her performance is great.

393
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,660
You don't know how happy she is.

394
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,260
Jiang Yao Ji, you say it yourself.

395
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,060
It's because you guys are too bad at drinking.

396
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
I gave you the 80 points.

397
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,060
You still didn't beat me.

398
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,460
What are you talking about?

399
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
I played the 80 points.

400
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
I played the game of the gods.

401
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
How could I lose?

402
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
You must have heard it wrong.

403
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,260
I remember this.

404
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,460
Jiang Yao Ji always started off with a defense.

405
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,060
She attacked us from the beginning.

406
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,460
She was fighting us.

407
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
How could we beat her?

408
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
No wonder.

409
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,060
Your play is so sinister.

410
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,260
It's too sinister.

411
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,660
Geng Xiao Qing.

412
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,060
Why are you here?

413
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,260
Why are you back?

414
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,660
Who is this?

415
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,060
Why are you so pretty?

416
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Geng Xiao Qing.

417
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,460
I met a classmate in the middle school.

418
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,260
Tong Zhuo.

419
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,060
Geng Xiao Qing.

420
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Hello, everyone.

421
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,260
I didn't dare to recognize you.

422
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
I saw you for a few times.

423
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
You don't look like you used to be.

424
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,460
I didn't change much.

425
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,860
I'm just like you.

426
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,460
And I didn't leave the group for a few years.

427
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,860
I'm not talking about your appearance.

428
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,260
I'm talking about your whole personality.

429
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,660
You were smiling so happily just now.

430
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,860
You talked so much.

431
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,060
I doubted you.

432
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,460
Why did you change so much?

433
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,860
Classmate.

434
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,460
You might have mistaken me.

435
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,060
I don't like to talk or laugh.

436
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,460
How could I be Ning Xi Le?

437
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Liu Er Mi Hou.

438
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
He's the leader of the village.

439
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,060
What the hell, Cai Feng Yuan?

440
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,860
Where are you?

441
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,260
Shut up.

442
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,460
Hurry up.

443
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,860
There's a light here.

444
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
There's a light.

445
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,660
Okay.

446
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
Okay.

447
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
No.

448
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
No.

449
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
My goodness.

450
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
The light is on.

451
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
Okay.

452
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,660
You can't hold it, right?

453
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
You can't hold it?

454
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
You can't hold it?

455
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Let's go.

456
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,660
Come on.

457
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Come back.

458
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Let's go.

459
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,460
One, two, three.

460
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Ning Xi.

461
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Love, love me in the light

462
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,460
You will see the flowers bloom

463
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Every minute, every second

464
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,460
I will be with you

465
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,460
Fly over the sea of sky

466
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,460
No regrets can stop me

467
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,460
This is the most precious and firmest

468
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,460
I'm here for you

469
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,460
I'm here for you

470
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
We can fly

471
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
No limit of expectation

472
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Let's cross the moon together

473
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,460
To the mountains and the sea

474
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,460
You are by my side

475
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,460
It's the best arrangement

476
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Love me in the light

477
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,460
You will see the flowers bloom

478
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Every minute, every second

479
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,460
I will be with you

480
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
Fly over the sea of sky

481
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
We are back.

482
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,700
Our mountain

483
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,460
Congratulations.

484
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Jiang Shaoxi is back.

485
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Lin Yintang, I'm back.

486
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
Listen to me.

487
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,460
You are the one who has seen the flowers bloom

488
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
Come on.

489
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Come on.

490
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,460
You are the one who has seen the flowers bloom

491
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
Come on.

492
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,460
You are the one who has seen the flowers bloom

493
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,460
I used to think this mountain is so high

494
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460
and hard to climb.

495
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Now I find you are like this.

496
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
Everything has changed.

497
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,460
You have gone far away.

498
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Xiaoxiao is quite sad.

499
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
Silly.

500
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460
What are you talking about?

501
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
People are sad when they see the wrong things.

502
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,460
Look at us.

503
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
We are not human beings.

504
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,460
We are not human beings.

505
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,460
We deserve to be singing.

506
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Do you understand?

507
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
Jiang Shaoxi

508
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Look how beautiful you are.

509
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
You are beautiful too.

510
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,460
Are you going to keep looking at me like this?

511
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,460
I mean looking at Wanxia.

512
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Mom.

513
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
You keep staring at Wanxia.

514
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
You will find that

515
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
they leave so fast.

516
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
They disappear in a blink of an eye.

517
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,460
I know.

518
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,460
They are not leaving.

519
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,460
They are on their way back.

520
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
When they see each other again,

521
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,460
they will be in the same boat.

522
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Yintang.

523
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,460
Actually I know

524
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
why you came to Junshan.

525
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Actually I can leave later.

526
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
You...

527
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
You are really a good boy.

528
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
I will see you in the future.

529
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Yintang.

530
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Aren't you scared?

531
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,460
Don't tell me

532
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,460
your wish since childhood

533
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
is to have a sense of separation between us.

534
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
I am going to be the one who left first.

535
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
This time

536
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,460
I won't treat your departure as a farewell.

537
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
When you left home,

538
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,460
I thought you were on your way home.

539
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
So Jiang Shaoxi,

540
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
can you promise me

541
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
and promise Chunru

542
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,460
to come back home soon?

543
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Go home.

544
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Go home.

545
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,460
Okay.

546
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
I promise you.

547
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,460
I promise Chunru

548
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
to come back home soon.

549
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
Okay.

550
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
I promise you.

551
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,460
I promise you.

552
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Lin Yintang.

553
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,300
I'm sorry.

554
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,900
What does that have to do with anything?

555
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,820
It's the heart.

556
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,260
Jiang Qiao Xi is leaving.

557
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,460
Don't you think it's good for her?

558
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,460
Why are you giving her away like this?

559
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,460
She's leaving.

560
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,940
She's sad too.

561
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,260
So I can't make her sadder.

562
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,980
What about you?

563
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,420
Jiang Qiao Xi is leaving tomorrow.

564
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,540
Why don't you cry?

565
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,340
What are you doing?

566
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,740
Compared to thinking that

567
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,060
she's leaving tomorrow,

568
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,660
I hope that

569
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,140
she can stay one more day.

570
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,060
She can stay one more day and be happier.

571
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,380
So I don't want to cry in front of her.

572
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,780
You said you weren't sad.

573
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,140
Hello?

574
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,180
Hello, Yin Tao.

575
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,620
I'm at your door.

576
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,060
Is it convenient for you to come out?

577
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,380
Who is it?

578
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,500
You... You're fat.

579
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,660
I'm going out.

580
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,860
Jiang Qiao Xi.

581
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,300
What's wrong?

582
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,900
I'm giving you this.

583
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,980
You're giving me this?

584
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,580
What is it?

585
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,540
Take it out and take a look.

586
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,180
Why are you spending money on gifts?

587
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,580
My cousin-in-law

588
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,140
picked this for me in Hong Kong.

589
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,700
I spent all my money

590
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,980
on my Olympic gold medal.

591
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,460
I can buy whatever I want.

592
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,540
Take it.

593
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,100
I'm going to buy it.

594
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm going to buy it.

595
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,420
I'm going to buy it.

596
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,380
I'm going to buy it.

597
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,140
Take it.

598
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,620
High-heeled shoes?

599
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,820
Is this horse suitable?

600
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:40,980
Yes.

601
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,420
How do you know my horse's number?

602
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,300
I saw a pair of shoe cabinet in your house.

603
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,220
It should be this horse.

604
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,220
How about this?

605
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,940
How is it? Is it suitable?

606
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,300
Just right.

607
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,220
Be careful.

608
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,020
Be careful.

609
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,540
Wow.

610
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,060
I just got a new pair.

611
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,900
Jiang Qiao Xi.

612
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,700
Look.

613
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,220
I look like this now.

614
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,380
I'm as tall as you.

615
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,580
It's so pretty.

616
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,700
It's for you.

617
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,380
Is it lipstick?

618
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,140
Do you want to try it?

619
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,100
No.

620
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,220
Why did you

621
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,740
give me lipstick

622
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,900
and high-heeled shoes today?

623
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,140
My sister-in-law told me

624
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,660
that it was the first time

625
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,820
she wore high-heeled shoes

626
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,460
and put lipstick on.

627
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,820
Then she realized

628
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,220
that she had grown up.

629
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,660
Leader.

630
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,100
I may miss your eighteen years old.

631
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,860
But I don't want to miss

632
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,500
the moment when you become an adult.

633
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,900
What about boys?

634
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,820
When do boys feel

635
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,900
they have become adults?

636
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,740
Jiang Qiao Xi.

637
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,660
When do you feel

638
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,460
you have become an adult?

639
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,980
When I

640
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,380
feel

641
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,780
each departure

642
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,940
Jiang Qiao Xi.

643
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,700
Do you not like me now?

644
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,140
Oh relationship

645
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,100
Don't be like this.

646
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,980
At times like this,

647
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,220
we should be happy.

648
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,220
We won't see each other again, right?

649
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,820
So we should be happy.

650
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,980
Be happy.

651
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,220
Be happy.

652
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,780
Yin Tang.

653
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
Actually,

654
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,980
it's not just because of my words,

655
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
that I bought you a lipstick with a high-end shape.

656
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,100
I always think that

657
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,260
if you wear high-end shoes and put on lipstick,

658
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,980
you will look very good.

659
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,140
I think it's the first time I've seen it.

660
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
Help me put it on.

661
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,220
I can't see it myself.

662
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,460
I'll try.

663
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,520
You look at this.

664
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,180
Does it look good?

665
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,220
Did youبر planning to buy it?

666
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,500
Did you put on lipstick?

667
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,660
No.

668
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,180
It looks good.

669
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,060
Although high heels and lipstick are too tight,

670
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,700
don't you feel scared, Lin Yitang?

671
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,060
Scared of what?

672
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,020
Scared of what?

673
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,700
He said that to you,

674
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,860
and then he left.

675
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,700
There are still many uncertainties in the future.

676
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,900
Don't you feel scared

677
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
to give your true feelings away?

678
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,660
Scared.

679
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,420
But it's something I'm afraid of and want to do.

680
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,700
Sometimes I want to be like you,

681
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,300
being bold and silly.

682
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,700
I said I'm not silly.

683
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,300
You hit me when you're not silly.

684
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,620
I'm the captain.

685
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,740
Then you give up.

686
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,620
Anyway, the function of strength is the effect.

687
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,540
Give me that.

688
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,020
Give me that.

689
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,980
Why are you calling me silly?

690
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,780
Come on.

691
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,460
It's late, why are you reading?

692
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,300
I want to finish reading the ending.

693
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,220
How's the ending?

694
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,780
I'll be there tomorrow.

695
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,340
The ending must be good.

696
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,660
Yu Qiao said

697
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,540
we won't see Jiang Qiaoxi off tomorrow.

698
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,820
You can go by yourself.

699
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,300
We'll leave Jiang Qiaoxi's last time

700
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,340
to you.

701
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,100
What do you mean by last time?

702
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,260
In the future, I and Jiang Qiaoxi

703
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,420
will have a lot of meetings.

704
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,540
How's it going?

705
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,460
The nestling has grown a lot.

706
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,740
You two have phenomenal relationship.

707
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,300
Yes.

708
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,580
You two will have

709
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,820
many chance in the future.

710
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,180
It's us who want to adopt Dr. будj학.

711
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,620
Let's keep a distance, OK?

712
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,260
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,100
I've read Harry Potter's ending.

714
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,060
Do you want me to tell you

715
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,140
the story like before?

716
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,060
Is the ending good?

717
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,180
At the end of the story,

718
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,140
Harry defeated the Merman.

719
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,780
Justice defeated evil.

720
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,860
Light defeated darkness.

721
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
He defeated hate.

722
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,420
Memories float in the air.

723
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,180
Pass through the window of time.

724
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,380
The cherry blossoms in summer

725
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,820
are in the distance.

726
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,580
The wish I made that year

727
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,660
became longer because of the familiar.

728
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
And then?

729
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,380
Then Harry became an Oro,

730
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,860
and he was with Rowen and Mitten.

731
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,380
He married Jin Mi.

732
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,980
They had a happy family.

733
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,740
And three children.

734
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,540
He sent them to Hogwarts.

735
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,260
The scenery in the waterfall

736
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,100
is like yesterday.

737
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,580
The reality is in front of us.

738
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,780
The future is in our hands.

739
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,380
You're the key to who I am.

740
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,300
Be with me and become myself.

741
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
He's so happy.

742
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,100
The night sky is long.

743
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
Yes.

744
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,100
His scar has been gone for 19 years.

745
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,700
I'm like a dream.

746
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,100
You're the key to all I dream.

747
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,100
Be with you and become yourself.

748
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,500
Everything is peaceful.

749
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,500
This is the ending.

750
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,300
The story is flourishing.

751
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,300
You're back.

752
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Ying Tao.

753
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,900
Hello, Uncle.

754
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,900
Hello, Uncle.

755
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,100
You don't remember me?

756
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,900
Mr. Wang,

757
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,500
all the gifts are here.

758
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,500
Okay.

759
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,300
Thank you, Xiao Zhang.

760
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,100
Wait for me downstairs.

761
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Okay, Mr. Wang.

762
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Uncle Wang.

763
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,500
Uncle Wang.

764
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,500
You remember me?

765
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Uncle Wang is back to visit his family.

766
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
He's here to see you.

767
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,100
Ying Tao.

768
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,500
You didn't recognize me.

769
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,300
Uncle Wang is going to be sad.

770
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,900
No.

771
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,700
I...

772
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,500
I'm so tall.

773
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,100
If you meet me on the street,

774
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
you may not recognize me.

775
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Ying Tao.

776
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm sure Brother Tang will pick him up at the airport.

777
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,100
He will.

778
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Don't worry.

779
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,100
He's familiar with Hong Kong.

780
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,700
They've arranged everything.

781
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,900
Everything is fine.

782
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,900
I'm worried about you.

783
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,100
Are you okay?

784
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,500
I'm fine too.

785
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Jiang Qiao Xin is going to do something big.

786
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,100
I'm happy for her.

787
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Brother Zhi.

788
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,300
You have to come and visit me more often.

789
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,500
You should come too.

790
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,500
We will all go to see you.

791
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Ying Tao.

792
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,900
You have to be safe and happy.

793
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,500
Be safe, everyone.

794
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,700
Uncle Wang.

795
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,500
A bull on a high mountain.

796
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Two bulls on a high mountain.

797
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Ying Tao.

798
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,500
Study hard at university.

799
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,100
Contact me if you need anything.

800
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,700
I treat you as a good friend.

801
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,500
I also treat you as my goddaughter.

802
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,500
Brother Zhi.

803
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,900
We have to meet and call each other often.

804
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,500
Until today,

805
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,300
we can be sincere brothers.

806
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,300
We can be sincere brothers.

807
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,900
There are few left.

808
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,300
Contact me often.

809
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,900
I'm also your brother, Uncle Wang.

810
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
You...

811
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,900
Call me one.

812
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Brother.

813
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,700
Brother.

814
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,500

815
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500

I'm sorry.

827
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I'm sorry.

828
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500

I'm sorry.

872
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,500
I want to forget the path

873
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
of ordinary growth

874
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
and get dizzy

875
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,500
and look far away

876
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,500
Once in a dream

877
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I smell

878
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
the scent of white night flowers

879
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,300
on the road

880
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Through the darkness

881
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
the extraordinary power

882
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,300
my dream

883
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,300
I want to let go

884
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
I want to let

885
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,300
I want to let you see

886
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,300
my heart shining

887
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,300
I want to sing

888
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,300
I want to sing for you

889
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,100
My loneliness and confusion

890
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,100
I want to forget

891
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
I want to forget the path

892
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,100
of ordinary growth

893
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
and get dizzy

894
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:18,100
and look far away
