00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,800
yarn

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
goodbye

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,800
To love To heal

4
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Episode 18

5
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
This is ready.

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Okay.

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Okay.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Let me help you.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
You're back.

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
You're not happy?

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Go and have a look.

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll go and have a look.

13
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Hello.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
What's wrong?

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Is this a performance suit?

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Have a look.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
It's pretty.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Why did you bring two sets home?

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:52,400
There's a set of

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
How's it going?

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
I have something to tell you.

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
That's okay.

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll do it for you.

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I'll do it for you.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
We'll be best friends from now on

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'll never talk to him

37
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Cai

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,000
What's wrong?

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Why are you still talking?

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
It's the same as when you were a kid

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
When you were a kid

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,200
Every time we fight

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
You can't beat Yuan Yuan

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Just say this kind of angry words

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
I didn't say angry words

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Okay, okay

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,800
What's wrong?

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Wait a minute

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,200
What's wrong?

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Cai Jin called me today

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,800
He said something happened to Qin

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,000
He went to the hospital

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Is it serious?

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
I don't know

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's go take a look

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Hospital

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,200
The hospital

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't need to be hospitalized at all

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,000
Really

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000
You

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Help me persuade the hospital

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Let him not listen to the doctor's nonsense

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,600
I don't need to be hospitalized

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
You let me go

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Dad

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Brother Qin

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
You have to listen to the advice

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
If you really think about Yunyun

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Then you have to treat it well

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,200
Then we just met Yunyun at the door

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
The kid said

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
You are good, he is good

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
You say you are now making it difficult for the child

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Yes

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
You have such a good daughter

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
You don't treat it well

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,200
You say you are so stubborn

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
You don't let Yunyun be difficult

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Someone just said

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Say I'm lucky

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Have a good daughter

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Just 17 years old

83
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Just like an adult

84
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
I don't like to listen to this

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
From childhood

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,000
He never had a child

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Since his mother left

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
The big and small things in the family

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
He is the one listening

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
I

91
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't do anything for him

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Lao Cai

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,800
Come

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,200
I just want to give him some money

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Let him live a better life in the future

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't waste money in the hospital

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,600
Besides, my legs are not well treated at all

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Brother Qin

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Don't think about the expenses

100
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Your leg is a public injury

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All the hospital expenses

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We can pay in the factory

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Don't move, don't move

104
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Don't move, don't move

105
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
What are you doing

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Lao Cai

107
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
I hurt

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
The unit changed its name once

109
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Can this be paid

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
Can this be paid

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
This is a new policy

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,400
You don't know

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,200
You don't know

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,400
You don't believe Lao Lin, Lao Yu

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
New policy

116
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Correct

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Yes, new policy

118
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,400
New policy

119
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,000
New policy

120
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Resuscitation

121
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,600
This is all the old injuries from decades ago

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Resuscitation

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
There must be no problem

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
You just listen to me

125
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,600
I put the number here

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Let's eat well, right

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Yes yes yes yes

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,000
Take care of it

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Take care of it

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,400
No problem

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Come and eat some fruit

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Let's let him rest early

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
看来 wagon

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
What are going to become

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Go

137
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
You don't know how to pack up.

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,280
Then you...

139
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,840
Ouch!

140
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Don't use your hands.

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,160
It's stuck.

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Let me help you.

144
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm not angry today.

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,160
You're not mad at me, right?

147
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
Why would I be angry at you?

148
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,960
I knew you were busy

149
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,000
and didn't come.

150
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,240
You wouldn't be angry at me

151
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
because of this.

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,400
Besides,

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm not angry at you.

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm going to send you the clothes.

155
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,360
I'll send them myself.

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,440
Lin Yintang,

157
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
you didn't do anything wrong, right?

158
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,280
I've made you unhappy these days.

159
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,800
Actually, I should say sorry to you.

160
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,040
But now,

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,400
I want to say thank you to you.

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,280
You want to thank me?

163
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Actually,

164
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm a little angry today.

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,680
But just a little.

166
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
A little angry.

167
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,040
Then I have to thank you.

168
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
What are you angry about?

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,520
You want me to send you the clothes

170
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,040
or to pack up your things?

171
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,160
Lin Yintang,

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
promise me one thing.

173
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Say it.

174
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,400
I'll promise you.

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
Don't go to school by yourself tomorrow.

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,640
Go with them.

177
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
Actually,

178
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,080
it's a misunderstanding

179
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
that Yu Qiao likes you.

180
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
The tacit understanding between you and Yu Qiao

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
was actually sent by Yu Jing.

182
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
This little kid,

183
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
she wants you to be her sister-in-law.

184
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,920
Yu Jing sent it?

185
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm just kidding.

186
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,920
How is that possible?

187
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
You know it was sent by Yu Jing.

188
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Then why are you still angry with me?

189
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
You're so inhuman.

190
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,880
Well,

191
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,840
I only found out last night.

192
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,040
Yu Jing bought bubble rolls in the shop.

193
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,480
He told me himself.

194
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Yu Jing is really a kid.

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
She's just a kid.

196
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
Yu Qiao is also a kid.

197
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,160
She couldn't take her phone well

198
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
and asked someone else to take it.

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll go back and scold her later.

200
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,080
You...

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,480
You pretend not to know about this.

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,280
Fine.

203
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,240
I know.

204
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
I'll pretend not to know.

205
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,280
Then they're brothers.

206
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,600
I had to suffer so much for nothing.

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,040
I had to suffer so much for nothing.

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,920
Yes, only they two are wrong.

209
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
I'll get the bag.

210
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,800
Yu.

211
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,360
Listen to me.

212
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,720
We've paid off your dad's hospital bills.

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,840
I asked the doctor.

214
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
He said it should be enough for your dad to be discharged.

215
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,320
Then you can pay us back

216
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,080
after the money is paid off.

217
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't worry.

218
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,160
Uncle Cai.

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,880
Can the old-age re-invention fee be paid off?

220
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
Uncle Cai is the manager.

221
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,400
Can the manager lie?

222
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,640
Don't worry about money in the future.

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,520
It's not a big deal.

224
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,160
Uncle Cai, how much do you want?

225
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,760
I'll go to the bank to get it for you.

226
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
Yu, no need.

227
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,080
We know your dad well.

228
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
The money he saved must be in the short term.

229
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,080
It's not worth it if you take it out now.

230
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
Yes, the interest is not much.

231
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Yes.

232
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,320
Then I'll thank you first.

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,360
No, no.

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,680
Yu.

235
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
You're still in school.

236
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,800
You have a heavy task to learn in high school.

237
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,880
I usually do some part-time jobs and sell fried skewers.

238
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
Now the field is getting cold.

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
It's hard to sell fried goods.

240
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,840
How about this?

241
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,680
I'll take care of your dad in the daytime.

242
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
You just study hard.

243
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,560
After you come back from school,

244
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
we'll change jobs.

245
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,800
Why do you believe Aunt Shuang?

246
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,760
It's too much trouble for you.

247
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,960
What trouble?

248
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,000
Uncle Cai and others gave me a salary.

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,520
It's higher than the average hospital's cost of care.

250
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,880
And the money can't be paid off.

251
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,800
Yu, it's a good arrangement.

252
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,720
Think about it.

253
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
If your dad has someone to take care of,

254
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
you can go to school with peace of mind.

255
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,720
And your Aunt Shuang can make money

256
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
and make a lot of money.

257
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,920
That's right.

258
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
Don't you want to make money for Aunt Shuang?

259
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,800
No, Aunt.

260
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,560
Then I'll thank Aunt Shuang.

261
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,040
I have to thank you for making money for the caretaker.

262
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,480
How is your brain working?

263
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,240
It's fine.

264
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,400
What a miscellaneous heart.

265
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:16,400
T впер angles,

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,760
It's losing a shot.

267
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,360
The uniform you wear on our calculating time is very beautiful.

268
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,760
We can get it for your class to wear in class.

269
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,080
You said so and it comes true.

270
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
It's great.

271
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
You two are so noisy.

272
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,440
You're making us three angry.

273
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
We're not in the same team.

274
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,840
You've been fighting since you were little.

275
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,040
When did we get involved?

276
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,640
No matter what you're noisy about,

277
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,040
you're not allowed to play with us.

278
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,640
Who wants to play with you?

279
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,040
It's not all bad.

280
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
What's bad?

281
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,840
You're ugly.

282
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
You're ugly, but you don't play with us?

283
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
You don't even say it

284
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,640
in such a big thing.

285
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Qin Yanyuan, you're too much.

286
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
I'm not happy about this.

287
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,440
And me.

288
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
And me.

289
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,240
You guys are so annoying.

290
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,640
Go home and sleep.

291
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Don't send us off.

292
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
Go back.

293
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
We'll watch you go in.

294
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
We'll talk about it later.

295
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,440
We must be more careful in the future.

296
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,640
Why?

297
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,040
Qin Yanyuan is like that.

298
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,240
The more she's in trouble, the more she's holding back.

299
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,640
If she doesn't want to tell us,

300
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,240
we'll find out.

301
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,240
Come on, everyone, gather.

302
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,040
The sports meeting will start tomorrow.

303
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm very confident in your performance.

304
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,240
Next, all you have to do is go home and rest.

305
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,840
Keep a good physical strength.

306
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,440
Looking forward to your wonderful performance tomorrow.

307
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,240
The game.

308
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Okay.

309
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Lin Qiang.

310
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Lin Qiang.

311
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Lin Qiang.

312
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,240
I have a big news for you.

313
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
Good news.

314
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
What good news?

315
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
The teachers of Qingbei University

316
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
will meet students who will participate in the math competition.

317
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,240
So Zhang Qiaoxi will definitely come to the school tomorrow.

318
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,640
Zhang Qiaoxi is really a good dancer.

319
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,840
Lin Qiang.

320
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,040
I can see your wonderful performance.

321
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,640
Thank you, dear Miss Jian.

322
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,040
You even made me a steamed bun and lotus root.

323
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
Thank you.

324
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay.

325
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,240
Your classmates are also very happy.

326
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,640
You like to eat lotus root and steamed buns, right?

327
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Yes.

328
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,640
This is my favorite.

329
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,440
You can make something else later.

330
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Okay.

331
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,640
Add some sugar.

332
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,640
That's enough.

333
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,440
It's too much.

334
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
It's not enough.

335
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,040
No, it's too sweet.

336
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,440
It's too sweet.

337
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
I knew it.

338
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,840
You should have told me

339
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,240
that you made it for Qiaoxi.

340
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,840
I wouldn't have made it for her.

341
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,520
I have to make it sweet.

342
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,820
Xiaoxi loves it.

343
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,120
Han Xing.

344
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,040
She loves exceptional spices.

345
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,240
Softung spices.

346
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,400
And delicious lately

347
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,840
D camino.

348
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,040
Like it, I have to make it touch my heart.

349
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
It's so nice to see you two together.

350
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,840
Such a happy time.

351
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,600
How is your father's mood now?

352
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,400
If you have any difficulties,

353
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
you must tell me.

354
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
Don't be polite, okay?

355
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,440
My father is fine recently.

356
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,000
Yueyue.

357
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,880
Take this.

358
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,720
No need, uncle.

359
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,360
It's too troublesome.

360
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,840
Listen to me.

361
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,680
I really don't need uncle.

362
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,320
Take it.

363
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,120
Uncle Zeng.

364
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,960
My father is sick this time.

365
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,080
Can't we take it back?

366
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,520
Yueyue.

367
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,120
Yueyue.

368
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,320
Your father

369
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
was injured more than ten years ago.

370
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,520
It's complicated.

371
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,280
It depends on the current condition.

372
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,680
So we can't take it back.

373
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,280
Don't worry too much.

374
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,360
Uncle and aunt will figure out a way

375
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,520
to help your family

376
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,840
get through this difficult time.

377
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,880
Miss.

378
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,440
Gu Yang.

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,680
What's wrong, uncle?

380
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,640
Your father

381
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,760
hasn't come out

382
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
in the toilet.

383
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,560
He doesn't know how to...

384
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,960
You...

385
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
How can I knock?

386
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,760
He doesn't know how to open the door.

387
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,080
Dad.

388
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,640
Dad, open the door.

389
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,120
Dad.

390
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,760
Dad.

391
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,160
You come and open the door.

392
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,960
Go back with me.

393
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,040
I...

394
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll be out soon.

395
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,720
I'll be out soon.

396
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,160
I'll go find someone to open the door.

397
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,760
Guangjiang, don't go.

398
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,760
You stay here and watch.

399
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,720
I'll go find someone.

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,920
Dad, open the door.

401
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,480
Dad.

402
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,280
Yueyue.

403
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,160
What about me?

404
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
How about we go back today?

405
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't think my dad

406
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
wants to see you today.

407
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,480
Nurse.

408
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,760
Nurse.

409
00:19:49,960 --> 00:20:16,860
Procedure of wet

410
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,880
The price of the car is 300,000 yuan.

411
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,560
The house is 500,000 yuan.

412
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,080
The development area in the east.

413
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
The future is good.

414
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
The wind and water are good.

415
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Today, Yun Yun said

416
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,200
that the small sales department can purchase and sell

417
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,240
magic small business cards.

418
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Many of her classmates like it.

419
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
With ten-year-old birthday wishes,

420
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,120
she wants to have her own tree.

421
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,240
Yun Yun, come here.

422
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Go inside and help me.

423
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm going to advertise.

424
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,920
Yes.

425
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
I'll get you two more.

426
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,760
Yun Yun's 13-year-old birthday wish

427
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
is to perform with a female star.

428
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
I asked the big sister of the committee

429
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,160
to plan a concert for Yun Yun.

430
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,760
Big sister is only concerned about fun.

431
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
She doesn't want to be on the stage.

432
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,160
I'll send Yun Yun an album.

433
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I don't know if she likes it.

434
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:48,960
Wait here.

435
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,160
Come back.

436
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,360
Come back and enjoy.

437
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,560
Happy birthday!

438
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,480
Qin Ye Yun.

439
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,320
Why are you sleeping here?

440
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,640
Get up.

441
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
You need to change your clothes and put on makeup.

442
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,720
Did you sleep well last night?

443
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,080
I didn't sleep well last night.

444
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm fine.

445
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,840
I'm fine.

446
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,680
I'm fine.

447
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,800
Can you do it?

448
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,160
Yes.

449
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
After I go back to the school today,

450
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,800
I'll send you back to the training camp

451
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,440
after I see the teachers in Qingbei.

452
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,600
Don't stay at the school.

453
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,480
The training camp is about to start.

454
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,800
You can't be late for the training.

455
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Do you know?

456
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,560
Yes.

457
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,600
Well,

458
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
when you get to the school,

459
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,880
I'll go in with you.

460
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,480
No need.

461
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,280
I can do it myself.

462
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,160
I need to meet the teachers in Qingbei.

463
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
I need to be with them.

464
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,680
I can't talk to you, Mr. He.

465
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,240
Today is the school's sports day.

466
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,920
Your classmates must be playing with each other.

467
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm worried

468
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,680
you're also playing with each other.

469
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,680
Hurry up.

470
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Hurry up.

471
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,320
What's the hurry?

472
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,720
Take a picture of your hands later.

473
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,440
Qi Yanbin used to be in the team.

474
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,600
They're all similar.

475
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
They don't know each other after changing their horses.

476
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,120
Lin Yintao.

477
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,800
Oh, no.

478
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,400
Oh, no.

479
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,160
I just realized today

480
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
that He Yintao is two different people.

481
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
Yu Cheng.

482
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,000
Da Fengyuan.

483
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,320
What are you doing here?

484
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,240
You're gathering here.

485
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,520
Lin Qi Le.

486
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,960
I didn't expect that.

487
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,320
That's Lin Qi Le.

488
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,920
I didn't expect that.

489
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
Lin Qi Le's classmates

490
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,360
are just as good-looking in my heart.

491
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,120
Monitor,

492
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,440
people are beautiful.

493
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,360
Don't say that again.

494
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,800
I didn't say that.

495
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
It's true.

496
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,560
Stop looking.

497
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,840
Jiang Qiuxi is probably in the school's office.

498
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,600
Come on.

499
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Who is it?

500
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
It's me.

501
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,240
Before the show,

502
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,920
we'll rehearse one last time.

503
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,600
Everyone, keep in shape.

504
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Remember,

505
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,120
you're the most beautiful.

506
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,800
And,

507
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,960
after the show,

508
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,560
don't change your clothes in a hurry.

509
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,480
We're going to the principal's office

510
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,440
to take a picture with the teachers from Qingbei.

511
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,760
He can't come to you,

512
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,040
but you can go to him.

513
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,080
Or wear this shirt.

514
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,360
Don't forget

515
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,240
you're alive and well.

516
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,040
What am I doing?

517
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,200
I feel everything.

518
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,280
This city is my love.

519
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,720
It's so scary.

520
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,560
Except you.

521
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm so scared.

522
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I'm not hurt.

523
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Then I'm not hurt.

524
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,240
Are you okay?

525
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,880
I'm fine, Qianyu.

526
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,040
Did you fall?

527
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,920
Let her rest for a while.

528
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,320
Let her rest for a while.

529
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,640
Don't stand up yet.

530
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,360
Qianyuan,

531
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
why did you make such a mistake?

532
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Coach,

533
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,160
I just accidentally took a move.

534
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,600
I won't do it again.

535
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Okay.

536
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,880
You take a break.

537
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
Let her sit there for a while.

538
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

539
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,760
Sheng Xia,

540
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,960
let's take a break.

541
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
Be careful.

542
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,160
Let's do it again later.

543
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,040
Okay.

544
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
I can't stand it anymore.

545
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,120
Qianyuan,

546
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,160
you didn't sleep at night.

547
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,640
Can you eat well?

548
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,320
Mom,

549
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,200
I didn't sleep at night.

550
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,920
I can't sleep at night.

551
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,960
Okay.

552
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I'll go to bed.

553
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
You didn't sleep at night?

554
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,120
What's going on?

555
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,640
Coach,

556
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm just a little nervous and insomnia.

557
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,240
But the situation just now

558
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,160
was unexpected.

559
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm fine.

560
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,840
Your performance is small.

561
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,240
Your safety is great.

562
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,640
If you still act like that later,

563
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,560
you should fall back when you fall forward.

564
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,400
What if you fall and fall?

565
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,200
What will you do?

566
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,840
Coach,

567
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,560
I...

568
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,640
Safety first.

569
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
Qin Yeyun,

570
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,560
you can't

571
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
do it anymore.

572
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,320
Coach.

573
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,200
Coach.

574
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,360
I know it's my fault.

575
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,520
I should take responsibility.

576
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,880
I can't do it this time.

577
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,240
But the other three members

578
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,400
of our drag team

579
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,080
shouldn't be responsible for my mistake.

580
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
It's not realistic for three people to drag.

581
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,920
Can you arrange a new move for them?

582
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,040
Yes, coach.

583
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,720
We've been practicing for so long.

584
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,800
If we don't let them go up,

585
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
it's a loss for us.

586
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,640
But one member of your team

587
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
will affect the overall coordination.

588
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,720
It's okay.

589
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
Luckily, you don't have to go up.

590
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,080
The rest of the members

591
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
should rehearse their formation.

592
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,800
It's the main task to complete the performance.

593
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,200
Don't drag everyone down

594
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,600
and affect the overall morale.

595
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,840
Just do as Xiaoman said.

596
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,240
Come on, everyone.

597
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Come on.

598
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Gather around.

599
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,360
Hurry up.

600
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Come on.

601
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Go.

602
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
You're the first one.

603
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,400
You, stand in front.

604
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
It's okay.

605
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,440
Come on.

606
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,960
You, five members in the back.

607
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,720
Here.

608
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
I'll do it first.

609
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
You, stand here.

610
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Here.

611
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Come on, the back.

612
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,400
Here.

613
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
It's okay.

614
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Okay.

615
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Come on, the third member.

616
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm sorry.

617
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
Qin Yanyuan.

618
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,320
Is it useful to apologize?

619
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,800
We've been practicing for so long.

620
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,280
Just because of you,

621
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,840
we don't even have a chance to perform.

622
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
Is there such a reason?

623
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,920
I know you're angry.

624
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,320
But Qin Yanyuan didn't mean it.

625
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,200
She's been working hard

626
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,360
lately.

627
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,040
She didn't want to do this.

628
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,280
Lin Qi Le.

629
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,840
Why are you still talking for Qin Yanyuan?

630
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,960
You've been practicing with the same hands and feet.

631
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,400
You know how hard it is.

632
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,040
Now, because of Qin Yanyuan,

633
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,080
you don't even have a chance to perform.

634
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,640
Aren't you sad at all?

635
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Why are you still talking for her?

636
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,720
Then, between Qin Yanyuan and the performance,

637
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,240
I'll definitely choose Qin Yanyuan.

638
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,680
I'm sorry.

639
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,520
I didn't mean to make a small group.

640
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,280
I was in a hurry.

641
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,720
I know we can't perform.

642
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,360
You're very sad.

643
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
I'm sad now

644
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,520
not because I can't perform.

645
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,240
I'm because

646
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,280
no one has ever said

647
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,680
that I'm sad.

648
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I'm sorry.

649
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm sorry.

650
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I'm sorry.

651
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm sorry.

652
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I'm sorry.

653
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
I'm sorry.

654
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,600
No one has ever said that to me.

655
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Wu Shuang.

656
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,560
If you're sad for Ceng Xiao Man,

657
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,120
you'd better be mad at me.

658
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,680
You two are actually...

659
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,280
Actually what?

660
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,480
We're not friends, right?

661
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,400
I didn't mean that.

662
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,880
Actually, I know.

663
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,880
I'm with Ceng Xiao Man.

664
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,480
As long as I can walk,

665
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
I'll stop.

666
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
He won't wait for me.

667
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,880
He needs me

668
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
just because

669
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,080
he's a popular student.

670
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,480
I need him

671
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,480
just because

672
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,480
I want to be a popular member of the group.

673
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,480
You know it very well.

674
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
What else can you talk about?

675
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,080
But if I were him,

676
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,280
I wouldn't leave my friend

677
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,080
because of a girl I hate.

678
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,880
I'd consider for him.

679
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,680
So,

680
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
you shouldn't be sad.

681
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
You're being serious with him.

682
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,480
If he's not serious with you,

683
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,080
it's his loss.

684
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
He should be sad.

685
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,280
Thank you.

686
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,480
Actually,

687
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
there's a way.

688
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Maybe we can go on the stage.

689
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,880
Listen up, everyone.

690
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,680
Remember the new formation.

691
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Don't be confused.

692
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,480
Don't be nervous.

693
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
Just do it.

694
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Coach.

695
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Don't be nervous.

696
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,880
Just do it.

697
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,080
I think it's not good.

698
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,880
Coach.

699
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,480
I think it's not good to change formation.

700
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
Although it looks easy,

701
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,680
if one person makes a mistake,

702
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
it'll be a mess.

703
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,880
Wushuang.

704
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,480
Coach.

705
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
We did a good job.

706
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,880
Coach.

707
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
We've changed the formation.

708
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,480
We've practiced many times.

709
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,680
It's okay.

710
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
We won't make a mistake.

711
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Please believe me.

712
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,280
Wushuang.

713
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,880
Can you do it so suddenly?

714
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,680
Coach.

715
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,880
Even if we're not good,

716
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,080
it's the last mistake

717
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,680
we make.

718
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
We're a team.

719
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,280
Wushuang.

720
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,880
You can't be so absolute.

721
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,680
You have to be responsible for your safety.

722
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,080
We've rehearsed for so long.

723
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,480
Now you suddenly join us.

724
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,080
What if someone gets hurt?

725
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,480
Okay.

726
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,080
You four.

727
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,480
Go back to your team.

728
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Thank you, coach.

729
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Thank you, coach.

730
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,880
Thank you, coach.

731
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Guys.

732
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,480
I've been a coach for so many years.

733
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,080
I know the little thoughts

734
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
between you girls.

735
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,280
Today is just a performance.

736
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,080
No matter how good or bad you perform,

737
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,680
all the audiences will forget it tomorrow.

738
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
Because it's not important to them.

739
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
But this performance

740
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,280
is very important to you.

741
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,080
As long as you do your best

742
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,680
and don't leave yourself with regrets,

743
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,880
that's the most perfect.

744
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,080
Do you understand?

745
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,480
Yes.

746
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
Come on, guys.

747
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,280
Let's cheer up for ourselves.

748
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Come on.

749
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,480
Three, two, one.

750
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,280
Go for it!

751
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,280
Here's your bracelet.

752
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,080
I don't need it anymore.

753
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
You don't want it?

754
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Many people want it.

755
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Don't regret it.

756
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,680
I want to go back to school today.

757
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I must come to see you.

758
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,480
Thank you, Mr. He.

759
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,080
You're welcome.

760
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,280
It's our teacher's achievement

761
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
to teach such an outstanding student

762
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,880
like Jiang Qiao Xin.

763
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,280
This way.

764
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,480
Come on!

765
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,880
Come on!

766
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,680
Sir,

767
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,680
I need to use the bathroom.

768
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
Go ahead.

769
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,080
Come on.

770
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,820
eny

771
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
ату

772
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,400
And you

00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,300
Jared's out!

776
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
I'm not good at singing

777
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
I'm not good at anything

778
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
I'm not good at anything

779
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
I'm not good at anything

780
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
I'm not good at anything

781
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm not good at anything

782
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
I'm not good at anything

783
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
I'm not good at anything

784
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
observed

785
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,080
See you soon

786
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,380
Be careful

787
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,380
This seat

788
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,220
I'm so happy.

789
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,020
I'm here.

790
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,140
Of course.

791
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,380
You are the key to who I am

792
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,380
Be my own

793
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Be my own

794
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,380
The night sky is long

795
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,380
My stubbornness is growing

796
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
I can't stop running

797
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,380
The only dream is to be alone

798
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:54,380
You are the key to all I dream

799
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,380
I will be your own

800
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,380
The story is growing

801
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Loneliness will be embraced and melted

802
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I am always here

803
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Don't be shy

804
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
Look up

805
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,380
You are a beauty today

806
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380
When am I not a beauty?

807
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,380
Come

808
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
Aunt Liang

809
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,380
What?

810
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,380
This is our school's cheerleading team

811
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
No, no

812
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
The kids have been practicing for a long time

813
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
That was Jiang Chaoxi's mother, Aunt Liang

814
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Is she beautiful and has a temperament?

815
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
Xiaoman

816
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
You are so close to Jiang Chaoxi's mother

817
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,380
You are so close

818
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
Yanqi

819
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
You and Jiang Chaoxi

820
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Have you read books in Qunshan?

821
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,380
You should know Jiang Chaoxi's mother, right?

822
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
I think so

823
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,380
Say something

824
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Look

825
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,380
I want to look at your straight eyes

826
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,380
I look good

827
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Can you look at me?

828
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
You can say it louder

829
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,380
Hey guys

830
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,220
Guys,

831
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,620
let's take a photo of Mr. Jiang.

832
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,260
I'll go to the school.

833
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,420
Smile.

834
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,380
Here you are.

835
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,140
This way.

836
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:17,940
Qiao Xin.

837
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,860
Come on.

838
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,820
Here.

839
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,620
Wait.

840
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,580
I'll wait.

841
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
Zhou Jie, it's okay.

842
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,100
I'll take a photo of a beautiful teacher.

843
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,820
Here.

844
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,620
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,540
You can stand here.

846
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,020
Come on.

847
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,900
Let's take a photo.

848
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,900
The second row,

849
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,260
please kneel down.

850
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,180
Okay.

851
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,420
Ye Qing Le,

852
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,620
look at me.

853
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,700
You stepped on me.

854
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,140
Sorry.

855
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,460
Come on.

856
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,380
Let's clean up your clothes.

857
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,740
Do you have a hat?

858
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Smile.

859
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,740
Be happy.

860
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,940
What are you looking at?

861
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,380
I didn't see it.

862
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,180
I saw it.

863
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,380
I felt it.

864
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,100
I didn't.

865
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,420
Come on.

866
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,500
Smile.

867
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,220
Three, two, one.

868
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,780
I'll take a photo of you.

869
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,300
Okay.

870
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,940
Come on.

871
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,900
Qiao Xin,

872
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,100
the school is over.

873
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,380
You can go now.

874
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,060
Come on.

875
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,780
Hurry up.

876
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,380
Hurry up.

877
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,820
Hurry up.

878
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,900
I can't see you.

879
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,700
Jiang Qiao Xin,

880
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,940
I've collected the study materials

881
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,020
for you.

882
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,940
I'll change my clothes.

883
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,700
I'll take it for you later.

884
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,220
Okay.

885
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,100
Mr. Le,

886
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,060
I'll go back first.

887
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,260
I'll get something for Jiang Qiao Xin.

888
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,140
Thank you, Xiao Man.

889
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,740
It's okay.

890
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,460
See you in Qingbei.

891
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,300
Okay.

892
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,260
I'll go first, Mr. Jiang.

893
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,820
This is nice.

894
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,580
This way.

895
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,220
Let's go.

896
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,180
What should I do?

897
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,220
I saw it.

898
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,500
But I haven't given it to him yet.

899
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,420
I have a lot to say.

900
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,140
I didn't say anything.

901
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,540
Jiang Qiao Xin.

902
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,580
Hello, Ms. Lin.

903
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,100
Hello, Xiao Man.

904
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,060
This is the study materials

905
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,580
I've collected for you.

906
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,340
Thank you.

907
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,900
Okay, let's go.

908
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,420
Okay.

909
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,220
See you.

910
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:26,660
Bye.

911
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,260
Bye.

912
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
I don't think there's any way out.

913
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,540
What way?

914
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,220
What are you talking about?

915
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,780
What did you see in the dream?

916
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,340
News andimagination.

917
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,660
Of us changing our clothes.

918
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,900
Your topic at 9 a.m.

919
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,140
I saw Shen energy starting

920
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,740
from the morning when I was sleeping.

921
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,460
That is when I saw it.

922
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,460
Good morning, bro.

923
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,140
Sure.

924
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,300
I thought I heard a girl wash her clothes.

925
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,180
I didn't know.

926
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,380
8 b.m.

927
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,820
Under five red light years old.

928
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:15,820
Through the darkness, the extraordinary power

929
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:22,820
My dream, I want to release

930
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,820
I want to let, I want to let you see

931
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,820
The light that shines in my heart

932
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,820
I want to sing, I want to sing for you

933
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,820
My loneliness and confusion

934
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,820
I want to forget, I want to forget the past

935
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,820
The past is a normal growth

936
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,820
In the clouds, in the distance

937
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:03,820
Once in a dream, I smell the fragrance

938
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Like the white night sky on the way to the morning

939
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,820
Through the darkness, the extraordinary power

940
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:24,820
My dream, I want to release

941
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,820
I want to let, I want to let you see

942
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,820
The light that shines in my heart

943
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,820
I want to sing, I want to sing for you

944
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,820
My loneliness and confusion

945
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,820
I want to forget, I want to forget the past

946
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,820
The past is a normal growth

947
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:54,820
In the clouds, in the distance
