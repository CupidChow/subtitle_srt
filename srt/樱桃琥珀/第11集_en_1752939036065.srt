Episode 18

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Auntie Liang.

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is Jiang Qiao Xi's medical fee.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you have anything to say to me?

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Auntie Liang.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Jiang Qiao Xi and I are classmates.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I want to be her friend.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Be her friend?

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Is there anything more important in your life?

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your life goal is to make friends.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My daily life is my life goal.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Friends, family, and study are all my goals.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But Jiang Qiao Xi's goal is to be an Olympic athlete.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She was chosen by math.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She is destined to go on the international Olympic stage.

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Will this affect me being her friend?

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This will affect me being her mother.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When you were young, you tricked me into your backyard.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You told me that you loved Jiang Qiao Xi more.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can you promise me that

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
if Jiang Qiao Xi goes back to Shuang City with you,

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you will love her more.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She doesn't like black letters that much.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She likes rabbits the most.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She likes to eat steamed buns.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you make it for her,

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
remember to add some milk in it.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That way, it will be more fragrant and delicious.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I thought it was ridiculous for a child to tell me that.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When I gave birth to Jiang Qiao Xi,

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I had 36 pairs of shoes.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I drained all the blood that I had.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No one loves her more than I do.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like her brother,

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
when Jiang Qiao Xi was very young,

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
she showed her math talent.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So my task is to help her go on the international Olympic stage,

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
protect her from all obstacles.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To ensure that she can reach that goal.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But you...

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
are the one who made her biased.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I never thought about her grades.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She resisted me for you,

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
without a second thought.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Lin Tao, if you really care about her,

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
please hope that she will be fine.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Please stay away from her, okay?

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Otherwise, because of you,

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
she may not be able to reach the stage she should go to.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
More importantly,

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you will affect our relationship.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
By then, I will lose this son.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And Jiang Qiao Xi,

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you will lose her mother.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I...

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I won't...

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I won't...

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I won't...

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Lin Tao,

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you won't.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You are a sensible child.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When you were young,

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you made the right choice.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now,

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you know what to do.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right?

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I...

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
More importantly,

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you will affect our relationship.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
By then,

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will lose this son.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And Jiang Qiao Xi,

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you will lose her mother.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hello?

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hello, Lin Tao.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Jiang Qiao Xi?

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Can you call me?

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They are not at home.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How is your wound?

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Does it hurt?

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Lin Tao,

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I am at home for recovery.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't have to go to class.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Can you give me some breakfast after school tomorrow?

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I...

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I...

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will see you tomorrow.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You should rest early and sleep early.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Take care of your wound.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am going to sleep too.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Bye.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will see you tomorrow.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I will see you tomorrow.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Bye.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Lyricist reconstructed

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yu Xiao!

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yu Xiao, come on!

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Yu Xiao!

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,000
Power!

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yu Xiao!

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yu Xiao!

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now he wins!

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,200
No, I'm happy too.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
What's going on?

111
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
I'll go in.

112
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,320
Hello, Mrs. Shuang Yan.

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,880
Nice.

114
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,160
Xie Yu.

115
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
Yu Qiao, congratulations.

116
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
I have something to do. I'll go home first.

117
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll go with you.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
Why is Xie Yu's face so pale?

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,640
Did something happen to Qin Shu?

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,040
I think so.

121
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,000
Mrs. Shuang Yan called me just now.

122
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
Let's go over there.

123
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Rong Xiao, don't worry. My mom is there.

124
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,400
Besides, something happened to Xie Yu's family.

125
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,080
She definitely doesn't want so many people to follow her.

126
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
You're right.

127
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,800
Although the school entrance to the sports club is still free,

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,360
we should stay

129
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
and help Yingdao and Xie Yu cover up.

130
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
Brother Qin,

131
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,720
didn't we agree

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,920
to go home and just sleep in the bed?

133
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,040
You're moving around.

134
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,880
What if you have serious leg pain?

135
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,680
It's fine.

136
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,680
It won't happen.

137
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,400
Don't listen to those doctors.

138
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm in good health.

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm fine.

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,080
My leg is just like this.

141
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
If I still go to treat it,

142
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,720
it'll be a waste of money.

143
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,680
My Yun is getting bigger.

144
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,080
I can't afford to delay it for a day.

145
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll spend all my money on it.

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,200
Sit down.

147
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
Why are you here?

148
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
You should be at school.

149
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,920
Go back to school with me.

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,800
Go back to school.

151
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,640
I can't stop you.

152
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,960
I can only tell Yun.

153
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
I heard you were out of the hospital.

154
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
I was worried and ran back.

155
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,160
I'm fine.

156
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
Go back to school.

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,840
You have to go back with me.

158
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I'll call an ambulance to pick you up at 120.

159
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
You're a kid.

160
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,720
You're talking nonsense.

161
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,480
It's a waste of medical resources.

162
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,720
It's good to have a friend.

163
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
I understand.

164
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,440
Go.

165
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Dad.

166
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,200
Enjoy it.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,680
Drink it.

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
Dad, I want to go back to school.

169
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,240
What did you say?

170
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,760
Say it again.

171
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
I'll go to work tomorrow.

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,720
What did you say?

173
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,680
I can't be a kid.

174
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,360
I want to be a kid.

175
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
What are you doing?

176
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,440
Yun.

177
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,280
What are you doing?

178
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,880
Yun.

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,640
Don't touch me.

180
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
You can't do this.

181
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm so annoying.

182
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
Dad, you're so tired of me every day.

183
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't need it.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
What are you doing?

185
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,920
Why are you reading that book?

186
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,200
Don't care about that book.

187
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,600
What are you doing?

188
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you doing?

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,760
These are my own business from now on.

190
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,960
I promise you.

191
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,920
I'll realize what you wrote.

192
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,040
Qin Yan Yu.

193
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,640
How old are you?

194
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,200
I'm your father.

195
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
I shouldn't have to bear it for you.

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
But I'm also your daughter.

197
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
I don't need you to bear the responsibility for me.

198
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,800
You're hurt like this.

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,280
I should come out early

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,920
to take care of the family and me.

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,040
And

202
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,760
I want you to rest in peace.

203
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,280
Have a good life.

204
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm an eggplant.

205
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,920
But other people have children.

206
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,320
I have a daughter.

207
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,360
Yun.

208
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,840
It's okay. Let's go.

209
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,520
Let's have a good talk.

210
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
Make it clear.

211
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,720
Mom.

212
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
Have you and dad

213
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,720
expected

214
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,280
what kind of person I would be in the future?

215
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,280
Yun Qi Le.

216
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
Qi Le Rong Rong.

217
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,840
Your father wanted you

218
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,640
to be a person who could be happy all the time.

219
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
Is that all?

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,760
Yes.

221
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,040
What if I don't fulfill this mission?

222
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,440
You can't be happy forever.

223
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
If you're not happy,

224
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
you're not our daughter anymore?

225
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,720
But

226
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,960
the best thing I've done

227
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,760
is to get into the 18th grade of the first grade of the experiment.

228
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,160
Other than that,

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
I have nothing special.

230
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,920
Don't you and dad feel disappointed?

231
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,160
Do you know

232
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,880
what the best thing I've done is?

233
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,560
It's you.

234
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,280
You chose to make me your mother.

235
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
Thank you.

236
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,440
Thank you for being my mother.

237
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,320
Enough.

238
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
Go and open the door and cook.

239
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Go.

240
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,680
I know.

241
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
What do you know?

242
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,560
I know. I know.

243
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,720
I know.

244
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
No matter what kind of person I become,

245
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,400
I won't lose you and dad.

246
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
Go.

247
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,720
Aunt Lin.

248
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,400
This is for Jiang Qiao Xi

249
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,160
and for you and Uncle Jiang.

250
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,200
I want to have breakfast with steamed buns.

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,200
Do you know what you are doing?

252
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
If there is a possibility

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,520
that Jiang Qiaoxi will lose her mother's love

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,080
in this world,

255
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,080
I should be by her side more firmly.

256
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,840
Let's go.

257
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
The shadow of the familiar is getting longer

258
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Your outline is so gentle beyond the sight

259
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Time is turning

260
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,160
The breeze is blowing

261
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,160
The scenery in the window

262
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,160
is like yesterday

263
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,160
The reality is in front of you, the future is in your hands

264
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,160
You're the key to who I am

265
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Be with me and become myself

266
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,160
The night sky is full of stars

267
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,160
My strong wind is blowing

268
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
I can't stop running

269
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
What is the call of the dream?

270
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,160
You're the spark in all my dreams

271
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Be with you and become yourself

272
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
The boundary is breaking

273
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
The rain will be melted by the hug

274
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm always here

275
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,160
The shadow of the familiar is getting longer

276
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Your outline is getting longer

277
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Your smile is running too fast

278
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
It's also accidentally kept

279
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
You're still mad at Uncle Qin?

280
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
You're still mad at Uncle Qin?

281
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
You're so angry that you haven't made up with him yet

282
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
How do you know?

283
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I asked Du Shang

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Du Shang asked him

285
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Why are you so unhappy?

286
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I'm not unhappy

287
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,160
I'm going to run 3,000 meters tomorrow

288
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm a little anxious

289
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,160
I know why you're unhappy

290
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Why?

291
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Because of Jiang Qiaoxi

292
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Why me?

293
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Because of Jiang Qiaoxi

294
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Why?

295
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Because of Jiang Qiaoxi

296
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm not happy

297
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Because of Lin Yintao

298
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I have no thoughts about Lin Yintao

299
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Don't talk nonsense

300
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
What thoughts?

301
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I didn't say what you thought about him

302
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Why don't you make up with him?

303
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
What am I looking for?

304
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
You...

305
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
How can you know that?

306
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
You don't know

307
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
you don't know

308
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
You don't know

309
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I don't know

310
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
How do you know?

311
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
How do you know?

312
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
How do you know?

313
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
I don't know

314
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Qianyuan

315
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
How do you know?

316
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
and treat her as someone she likes.

317
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,920
Qi Yanyu.

318
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,800
Don't worry.

319
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,760
I'll keep it a secret for you.

320
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,280
No.

321
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
I just want to ask you.

322
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
If it were you,

323
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
would you do it?

324
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
I did it.

325
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,160
Based on your 산 wie evidence dry

326
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,080
I think he's in a good mood.

327
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,520
Come in, iyi Normally

328
00:20:59,680 --> 00:20:59,700

329
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,620
볼�인데

330
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,040
sleeping

331
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,520
will

332
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:07,780
always be

333
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,280
beautiful

334
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,520
Mom.

335
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,920
I didn't see seine spin that day?

336
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,320
that you feel lonely

337
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,780
I

338
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,060
Look,

339
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,720
He's really famous bluetooth beauty,

340
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,240
right,

341
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,080
uler's

342
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,220
I'm

343
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,200
I don't mind

344
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,680
you being friends.

345
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,560
But after ten years,

346
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,280
twenty years,

347
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,680
you'll realize you're not on the same side.

348
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,120
Even when

349
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,120
you don't know each other,

350
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
you'll understand.

351
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,120
Mom,

352
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,640
Lin Yintao and I

353
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,800
will still be friends

354
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,720
even after ten years.

355
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm not sure

356
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,840
if I can be friends with you.

357
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,080
I thought so

358
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,240
when I was your age.

359
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,280
I thought

360
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,320
I could be friends with my friends forever.

361
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,600
But after graduation,

362
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,040
we stopped contacting each other

363
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,080
with mutual understanding.

364
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,200
Now,

365
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,760
you're the only one I have.

366
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,880
I'm not sure if I can be friends with you.

367
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,280
But I'm sure

368
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,520
you can be friends with me.

369
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,120
Mom,

370
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,320
you're just

371
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,680
classmates.

372
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,360
Real friends

373
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,560
won't be like this.

374
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,280
You know more and more now.

375
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,200
You're getting more capable.

376
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,400
I don't care

377
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,440
what kind of classmates you are

378
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
or what kind of friends you have.

379
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,000
This time, you must

380
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,000
do your best.

381
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,760
What if

382
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,400
I don't?

383
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,680
No ifs.

384
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,140
Hey,

385
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,200
are you happy now?

386
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,000
Mom,

387
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,720
means to look down upon the bias.

388
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,480
¡¯·

389
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,760
You're under arrest now.

390
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,640
Wave to the people.

391
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,700
You can jump a couple times.

392
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,000
I won't do it.

393
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,480
I went to the school this morning.

394
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
I'm going to run 3,000 meters today.

395
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,040
You're so hardworking.

396
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,480
He runs every day.

397
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
He's the best.

398
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,240
How is Qin Yuanyuan?

399
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
How is Wenbo?

400
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,800
You guys didn't go to see him last night.

401
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,640
So boring.

402
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
You're so kind.

403
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Don't mess with us as soon as you come up.

404
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
We really went there yesterday.

405
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,800
He sold us when we just arrived at the gate.

406
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
He's just so good.

407
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,200
It's your contribution to make him angry.

408
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Are you ready?

409
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
Now, listen to my strategy.

410
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
We'll break through the enemy's wall.

411
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Let's go.

412
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Uncle Qin.

413
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Uncle Qin.

414
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Uncle Qin.

415
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Uncle Qin, do you have milk?

416
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Yes, yes, yes.

417
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes.

418
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
Give me the milk.

419
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Uncle Qin, do you have spicy strips?

420
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you have chicken drumstick bread?

421
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
Do you have pickled ginger and fennel?

422
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,800
Yes.

423
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
You don't know what I have.

424
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Take it.

425
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Give them all.

426
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
No need.

427
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
We don't want these.

428
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
What?

429
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,800
What do you mean?

430
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
My parents have told me

431
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
that if Uncle Qin doesn't rest well,

432
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
we can't come here to buy things.

433
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,800
Yes, I agree.

434
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
No business, no harm.

435
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,800
What harm?

436
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,600
What harm?

437
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You don't sell Uncle Qin's stuff.

438
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
That's the harm.

439
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,600
Sorry, Uncle Qin.

440
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
We're just following orders.

441
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
You're so thoughtful.

442
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Qin Ye Yun.

443
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Just smile.

444
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,000
If you don't go back to class, you'll cry.

445
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,800
You didn't listen to the news.

446
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
No matter how poor you are, you can't be a poor kid.

447
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,800
No matter how poor you are, you can't be poor in education.

448
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,000
Exactly.

449
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Play and play, make trouble.

450
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Don't make fun of studying.

451
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Today is the last day of the sports meeting.

452
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,000
You can skip class.

453
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
If you don't go tomorrow,

454
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
you'll miss the class.

455
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
High school is so tight.

456
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
If you miss a class,

457
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
you won't be able to keep up.

458
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Stop it.

459
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,600
You think Qin Ye Yun doesn't miss it?

460
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
No, he does.

461
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,200
But Uncle Qin doesn't listen to the advice.

462
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,400
But Bai Shan Xiang is the first.

463
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,600
In ancient times,

464
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,640
the

465
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,800
Today, Yu Qiao sent a thousand miles.

466
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,200
Are you really not going to cheer for him?

467
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Let's go to school.

468
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
Goodbye, Uncle Qin.

469
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Go.

470
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,600
Go.

471
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,400
When Jiang Xiang Xi comes back,

472
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,000
will she go to school with us?

473
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
How can we let her go easily?

474
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
What about going to school with us?

475
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
You forgive her.

476
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,600
I haven't forgiven her.

477
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
What do you mean?

478
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,400
She didn't contact you

479
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,600
or us.

480
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,800
When she asked you to make up,

481
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
yes, she showed her sincerity.

482
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
But what about us?

483
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
She didn't show her sincerity to us.

484
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
What are you doing?

485
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
I've already made up with her.

486
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
You can't make up with her.

487
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Jiang Xiang Xi is your side product.

488
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
If you don't make up with her,

489
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
we won't make up with her.

490
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,600
If you make up with her,

491
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
we have to make up with her.

492
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
You said it.

493
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
It makes sense.

494
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm the one who stands in the right direction.

495
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
We did

496
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,200
treat her as a friend.

497
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
She hasn't contacted me for years.

498
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
I feel bad about it.

499
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,400
I can understand her.

500
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Last time, I was in the wrong.

501
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,600
Brother Wu.

502
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,800
What are you doing?

503
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
See you by the sea on Saturday night.

504
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Let her find a way to move us.

505
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Come on.

506
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,200
Brother Qin.

507
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
You're just standing there.

508
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,400
It's a waste of time

509
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,800
and your time.

510
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Yes.

511
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I've thought it through.

512
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm not going to stand there anymore.

513
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,200
To be honest, my legs

514
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
are really useless.

515
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,800
If I move a little,

516
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm going to die.

517
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
I've realized

518
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
my mistake.

519
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
You know you're wrong.

520
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,400
Then change it.

521
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,600
This is your fault.

522
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,400
Do you want your child

523
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
to talk to you?

524
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
How can I?

525
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I'll change it.

526
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,800
I'll change it.

527
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm thinking of a way to change it.

528
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
There is a way.

529
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Shuyi.

530
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,800
You're still selling out.

531
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
How about this?

532
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Don't sell out.

533
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,000
Just come to my shop

534
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and help me.

535
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,800
I'll give you a monthly salary.

536
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
The salary will be more than you

537
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
when you're out.

538
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,200
You don't have to work hard.

539
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Brother Qin.

540
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,200
This won't do.

541
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
How much money do you have left?

542
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Give me the salary.

543
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
How much can you have left?

544
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,800
It's too tight.

545
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
Let me see.

546
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No.

547
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Okay.

548
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
How about this?

549
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,800
Open the stall

550
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,400
next to my shop.

551
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,200
You can bring customers

552
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,400
to take the money from your stall.

553
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,800
You can also take the money from the shop.

554
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,600
It's good for everyone.

555
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Okay.

556
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,200
Okay.

557
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Okay, Shuyi.

558
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,800
We have a deal.

559
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
I'll go to the shop.

560
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Okay.

561
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
Aunt Shuyi.

562
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,600
Where are you going?

563
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
To school.

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
Help me check.

565
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,800
Do you have a plate

566
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
for this kind of pattern?

567
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Yes.

568
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,000
But now

569
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
there's something more important than buying a plate.

570
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
What do you mean?

571
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,800
Yu Qiao is going to run 3,000 meters today.

572
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,000
We're going to cheer for him.

573
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Are you going?

574
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

575
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

576
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,200
You can do it.

577
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
You can do it.

578
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,800
He's crazy.

579
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
He's not a hero.

580
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,000
He's so cool.

581
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
Of course.

582
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Come on.

583
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,600
I still very much agree

584
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
with the director Feng's creative power.

585
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
As the CEO of the website,

586
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
and the director of CF,

587
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
I'm determined to go back and ask him for advice.

588
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Don't always be in a hurry.

589
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,000
At least write something like

590
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
a meeting of courage

591
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
and a fruit of hard work.

592
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Human is just a piece of cake.

593
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

594
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

595
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,800
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

596
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

597
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

598
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Yu Qiao, you can do it.

599
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Where's Yu Qiao?

600
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What's wrong?

601
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Yu Qiao.

602
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
Why are you here?

603
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,000
Let me see.

604
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Let me see your Yu Qiao.

605
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,600
Are you okay?

606
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,000
Yu Qiao.

607
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Are you okay?

608
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm fine.

609
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,600
Where's Yu Qiao?

610
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Is he too nousy for functions?

611
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,200
Yu Qiao, go for it!

612
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,900
Yu Qiao, you can do it!

613
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,300
Yu Qiao, you can do it!

614
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,600
Yu Qiao, go for it!

615
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,800
Yu Qiao, you can do it!

616
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,380
Lin Jia

617
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
licensing me.

618
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yu Qiao, you can do it!

619
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
In those lovely days,

620
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,600
I was sure magic will once again

621
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,840
come back to life.

622
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,280
Which makes me happy.

623
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,700
S Melissa Crystal

624
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,740
May I?

625
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,020
Thank you.

626
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,760
Will you please please

627
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
Jiang Xiao.

628
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,520
Gao Yuan.

629
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,360
Let's wait for him in the middle.

630
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,360
Go.

631
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,160
Don't put too much pressure on Yu Xiao.

632
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,360
Right.

633
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,760
We have Jiang Xiao Xi anyway.

634
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,520
Go.

635
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,320
Don't rush.

636
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,280
Just finish it.

637
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
Go, Yu Xiao.

638
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,720
Yu Xiao.

639
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,920
Go, Jiang Xiao.

640
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,480
Go.

641
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Just look ahead.

642
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,040
Walk every step at the end of the corner.

643
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,640
You'll reach the end soon.

644
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,640
Go, Jiang Xiao Xi.

645
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,640
Hurry up.

646
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,760
Just look ahead.

647
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,720
You'll reach the end soon.

648
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
You'll reach the end soon.

649
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,040
Right?

650
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,280
At the four-year sports meeting,

651
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
I told you.

652
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,600
Right.

653
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,320
Now it's my turn to tell you.

654
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,600
Go.

655
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
Don't think that

656
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,160
I'll give you the half-winded hand.

657
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,760
It's okay.

658
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,080
You can give it to me later.

659
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,200
Go, Yu Xiao.

660
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,640
Hold on.

661
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,480
Go.

662
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Go.

663
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:25,960
Go.

664
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,400
Yu Xiao, go.

665
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Go.

666
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,320
Slow down.

667
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,800
Go.

668
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,840
Yu Xiao.

669
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,720
Jin Shi Ming.

670
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Jin Shi Ming.

671
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,800
Are you okay?

672
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,520
Slow down.

673
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,320
What's wrong?

674
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,360
Go to the bathroom.

675
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,560
Go to the bathroom.

676
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,360
Be careful.

677
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,320
Slow down.

678
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,880
Be careful.

679
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Thank you, teacher.

680
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,920
Be careful.

681
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,320
Are you okay?

682
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm fine.

683
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,440
How is it?

684
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,640
Are you ready?

685
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,080
Slow down.

686
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,200
Actress Qin.

687
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,120
She speaks so well.

688
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,440
Are you okay?

689
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,040
I'm fine.

690
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,640
I just sprained my ankle.

691
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,120
I'll be fine in a few days.

692
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,080
Where is Jiang Xiao Xi?

693
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
She went back to do the homework.

694
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
She's going to the Donglin Camp in a few days.

695
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,000
But she's relieved to see you're okay.

696
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,360
She shouldn't have come here today.

697
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,760
The competition was so tense.

698
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,840
Her head is injured.

699
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,240
She should stay at home and recuperate.

700
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,600
Why did she come to school?

701
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,680
You're joking.

702
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,040
You should be the first.

703
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,600
She ran around with a broken head.

704
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,400
She's an adult.

705
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,560
She doesn't know how to care for herself.

706
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
Are you caring for Jiang Xiao Xi?

707
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,080
Don't talk nonsense.

708
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,240
How is that possible?

709
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,640
What can I care about her?

710
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,840
Jiang Xiao Xi.

711
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,720
Jiang Xiao Xi.

712
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,320
Are you clear now?

713
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,960
How is your wound?

714
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,040
Are you feeling better?

715
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,800
Didn't my mother tell you?

716
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm just worried about you.

717
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
We're like friends.

718
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,840
You don't know what friends mean.

719
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,360
Real friends can help each other out.

720
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,000
It can make your relationship better

721
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,640
without hurting yourself

722
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
or vice versa.

723
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,760
My friend doesn't hurt me.

724
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,480
I'm willing to be hurt for her.

725
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,680
Besides,

726
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,920
I'm getting better

727
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,920
and better now.

728
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,840
Can you report these to my mom?

729
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,120
Jiang Qiaoxi,

730
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,480
stop being so stubborn.

731
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,960
How's Yu Qiang's foot?

732
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,800
He said he was slightly injured.

733
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
He's fine.

734
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,560
He's the first one to run every year.

735
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,520
But he ran the last one this year.

736
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,880
He won't be sad, will he?

737
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,400
You know he's the first one every year?

738
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,800
How could I not know?

739
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,480
I also know that

740
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
Yu Qiang wants to be an air force pilot.

741
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,800
So he cares about his vision.

742
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,600
Du Shang wants to study medicine.

743
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,720
So he often reads medical books when he's free.

744
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,600
From the beginning of high school,

745
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,400
Cai Fang Yuan is going to set up his own website.

746
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,520
So you've been secretly following them.

747
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,480
Of course.

748
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,000
But

749
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,160
what I can do is only to follow.

750
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,920
You went to the summit with Yu Qiang today.

751
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,520
It's very commendable.

752
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,680
Ding.

753
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,760
What commendable?

754
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,520
I'm a person who can pee.

755
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,440
But I didn't have a chance to show it before.

756
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,840
Then you have to work hard.

757
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Cai Fang Yuan and Du Shang

758
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,360
are cold-hearted.

759
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,360
It's hard to tell if they can take you back to the team.

760
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,520
Really?

761
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,440
Really.

762
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,360
It's useless to persuade me.

763
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,400
It's okay, Ying Tou.

764
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,360
Don't worry.

765
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,760
I'll try to make them accept me.

766
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,280
If it doesn't work, you can do it.

767
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,320
Mr. Lin, teach me.

768
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,520
You can always handle these problems.

769
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,280
They asked you to go to the beach on Saturday.

770
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,360
It depends on your ability to accept them

771
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,040
and warm their hearts.

772
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,520
Only this once.

773
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,480
Okay.

774
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,320
I'll work hard.

775
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,920
I'll do my best.

776
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,760
Why are you laughing?

777
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,440
Why are you serious?

778
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,040
Look at you.

779
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,480
You're teasing me.

780
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,440
Look at your expression.

781
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,560
They're teasing me.

782
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,840
But who am I?

783
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm so smart.

784
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
I won't be fooled.

785
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,080
I know they asked you to go to the beach

786
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,040
to welcome you back to the team.

787
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,240
So it's a welcome.

788
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,200
I'm going to accept their challenge.

789
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,480
I've decided.

790
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,880
We'll go to the beach to put fireworks on Saturday.

791
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,240
We'll make up for the fireworks we didn't see before.

792
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,580
Pull over.

793
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,480
Unannya

794
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,240
Li Yindeng

795
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:10,800
What's up?

796
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,720
Isn't the Lightning dont' look good?

797
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,480
Yes

798
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:14,840
It is

799
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,520
Really

800
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,240
Why do I have to look good?

801
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,720
You become too annoying when you see someone looking good

802
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,000
Why do you look so good?

803
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,400
Because...

804
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm sorry, Zhang Qiao Xi.

805
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,960
Don't cry, Lin Hao.

806
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,160
You can't cry.

807
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
It's been seven years.

808
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,160
We've been together for seven years.

809
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,920
It's over.

810
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,640
Zhang Qiao Xi.

811
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,920
In the future,

812
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,240
we have many more seven years to spend together.

813
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,360
Yes.

814
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,720
In the future,

815
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,360
we have many more seven years to spend together.

816
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,520
Once in a dream,

817
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,960
I want to look at the sea

818
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,800
but I hear the sound of the dream

819
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,680
crossing the darkness.

820
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,280
The extraordinary power

821
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,520
of my dream

822
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,600
I want to let go.

823
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,720
I want to let you see

824
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,680
the shining light in my heart.

825
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,440
I want to sing

826
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,520
to let you hear

827
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,480
my loneliness and confusion.

828
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,160
I want to forget

829
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,360
the ordinary growth

830
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,360
in the past.

831
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,240
I'm floating in the clouds

832
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,160
and looking afar.

833
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Once in a dream,

834
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,600
I smell the fragrance

835
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,600
like the white fireworks on the way to the early morning.

836
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Crossing the darkness,

837
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,600
the extraordinary power

838
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
of my dream

839
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,600
I want to let go.

840
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I want to let you see

841
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,600
the shining light in my heart.

842
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I want to sing

843
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
to let you hear

844
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,600
my loneliness and confusion.

845
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
I want to forget

846
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,600
the ordinary growth

847
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,600
in the past.

848
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,600
I'm floating in the clouds

849
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
and looking afar.

850
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,600
Looking afar.
