His Lordship, if you enjoys
Lady Yulou's company,

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,140
and speak with no intent

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,130
of taking her as a concubine,

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,820
then may Lady Yulou

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,020
return home with me

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,130
and marry as soon as possible.

36
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,050
I do not intend to take a concubine.

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,900
Lady Yulou, please

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,290
return home with me.

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,890
I'll grant two counties

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,060
as Lady Yulou's personal fief,

41
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,170
along with double
Governor of Taozhou's betrothal gifts,

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,820
to present to Lady Yulou

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,730
as my formal proposal.

44
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,220
I, Liu Yan,

45
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,610
sincerely wish to marry Lady Yulou

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,340
and make her my wife.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,260
And the Lady of Liangya

48
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,500
to share my honor and disgrace,

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,290
blessing and misfortune.

50
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,690
My Lord, you're noble and graceful.

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,620
Naturally,

52
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,340
I am willing.

53
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,410
No woman should have two husbands.

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,730
What will the Su Clan decide?

55
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,410
Your Excellency,

56
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,500
what do you think?

57
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,980
My Lord,

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,030
Lady Su bears the peony mark.

59
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,610
Marrying her secures the Central Plains.

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,060
Your time has come.

61
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,500
Wushan will spare no effort

62
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,290
to arrange your wedding.

63
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,180
(Mansion of the Lord of Liangya)

64
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,140
My Lord,

65
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,980
all betrothal gifts are ready.

66
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,540
My Lord,

67
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,260
this is the wedding dress for the Lady.

68
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,290
Please have a look.

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,660
Come on.

70
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,610
Send a team with me.

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,180
I want to go up the mountain myself

72
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,810
and hunt a lynx for her.

73
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,940
Yes.

74
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,260
Lady Yulou.

75
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,940
My Lord.

76
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,130
You're just in time.

77
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,060
Come and look.

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,410
Are these all to your liking?

79
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,660
I've sent off the envoy from Wushan.

80
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,570
No need for you to keep up the act.

81
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,170
It's time we turn

82
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,610
to real business.

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
The Yongning Canal is going smoothly.

84
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,340
You must act without delay.

85
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,420
(Xue Tai, Juejun)
I'm willing to assist with 50,000 troops

86
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,340
to show my sincerity.

87
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,410
If you

88
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,850
have such sincerity,

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,850
then I

90
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,660
shall flatten Wei

91
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,850
and share it with you.

92
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,020
My Lord,

93
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,230
you'll surely triumph.

94
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,700
Prepare the troops.

95
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Let's go.

96
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,460
(Yujun, Wei State)

97
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,980
(Wei Mansion, Wei)

98
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,730
We'd better hurry over too.

99
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,410
If we're late, we might miss it.

100
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,420
Alright.

101
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,490
Lady Xu

102
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,540
is so kind to us.

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,940
My Lady.

104
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,410
What are they happy about?

105
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,880
Lady Xu is preparing
your mourning end rites.

106
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,220
She's making new clothes for you.

107
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,220
Since summer's coming,

108
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,220
she thought

109
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,290
it'd be nice

110
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,930
to gift everyone a new set.

111
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,590
Everyone's happy

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,900
and thanking Lady Xu.

113
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,780
She just sent word,

114
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,580
asking you to go get measured.

115
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,100
Make sure it's accurate,

116
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,780
so the clothes fit properly.

117
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,850
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,780
When I was young,

119
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,730
my figure was just like hers.

120
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,900
Women at each age

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,290
have their own kind of beauty.

122
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,730
For a woman's life,

123
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,610
wisdom and character matter most.

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,580
Family is the most reliable.

125
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,980
That may be true,

126
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,930
but Grandmother and Mother,
you were surely

127
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,170
great beauties in your youth.

128
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,100
How else could you have birthed

129
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,540
someone as handsome as the Lord?

130
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,050
You hear that?

131
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,900
In one short sentence,

132
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,460
she managed to flatter all of us.

133
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,550
Yes.

134
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,100
Such a sweet-talker.

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,170
It's fine
if the clothes are a little loose.

136
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,140
It'll be more comfy.

137
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,800
Once the mourning period ends,

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,640
you and Zhonglin
can consummate your marriage.

139
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,410
If you become pregnant,

140
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,220
you won't fit into the clothes anyway.

141
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,660
My Lady,

142
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,900
the Lord is here.

143
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,170
Grandmother, Mother.

144
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,850
We were just talking about you.

145
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,050
In a few days,

146
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,700
once the mourning period ends,

147
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,730
you two should consummate your marriage.

148
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,810
Your grandmother and I are waiting
for a grandchild.

149
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
Mother,

150
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,020
you've worked hard preparing

151
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,930
the mourning end rites.

152
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,850
Please take some time to rest.

153
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,210
Grandmother,

154
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,080
I have something
to discuss with the Lady.

155
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,460
We'll excuse ourselves for now.

156
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,300
Alright.

157
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,810
Why must you bring up that?

158
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,850
It's a good thing.

159
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,410
A year ago,

160
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,780
when we were about to get married,

161
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,700
your grandfather passed away,

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,410
yet we had no choice.

163
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,220
It's been a hard year for you.

164
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,460
My Lord.

165
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,410
This whole year,

166
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,660
I never dared speak of Grandfather

167
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,460
for fear of reminding you

168
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,220
of how he betrayed you.

169
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,100
But...

170
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
I miss him so much.

171
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,890
Manman,

172
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,700
from now on,

173
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,640
you can talk to me about anything.

174
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,980
(Spirit Tablet of Qiao Gui,
My Late Grandfather)

175
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,060
(Spirit Tablet of Qiao Gui,
My Late Grandfather)

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,060
(Spirit Tablet of Qiao Gui,
My Late Grandfather)

177
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,570
My Lady.

178
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,570
My Lady.

179
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,820
Have you read the silk scroll

180
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,320
at the bottom of your dowry chest?

181
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,940
No.

182
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,660
The one Lady Ding put

183
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,420
at the bottom of the chest.

184
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,370
My Lady,

185
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,420
it's time you read it.

186
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,100
I've looked into it.

187
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,980
The Lord has never had a concubine.

188
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,180
He must be
inexperienced and inconsiderate.

189
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,460
He's also a bit reckless.

190
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,700
I'm afraid he might hurt you.

191
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,010
I'll read it.

192
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,300
I'll read it now, okay?

193
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,340
Enough about this.

194
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,300
I'll go get it.

195
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,850
Forget it. I'm not eating.

196
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,540
Saddle the horse. We're going back.

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,140
Are you afraid?

229
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,650
No.

230
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,130
Then I'm not either.

231
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,370
Back then, you had no choice

232
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,010
but to marry me

233
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,850
yet still allowed me a year of mourning
for Grandfather.

234
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,340
Thank you.

235
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,690
It was the least I could do.

236
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,340
A year ago when I married you,

237
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,940
we couldn't stand each other.

238
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,820
There was only mistrust.

239
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,130
How could we have shared a bed?

240
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,180
What about now?

241
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,660

245
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,290

My Lord!

284
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,120
Stop shushing. I heard it.

285
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,940
I have urgent news to tell you.

286
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,770
What is it?

287
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,810
It's urgent military news.

288
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,000
My Lord, please open the door.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,670
Whatever it is,

290
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,630
wait till tomorrow.

291
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,050
Yanzhou is under siege.

292
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,170
What?

293
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,390
Liu Yan has 200,000 troops with him.

294
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,900
But Liancheng is backed by mountains.

295
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,460
Once in, no one comes out.

296
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,710
So,

297
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,450
(Xiaogang, Panyi)
let's strike from Xiaogang

298
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,480
and have Qiao Ping march

299
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,590
from Kangjun.

300
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,660
Then we'll crush them.

301
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,060
Yes.

302
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,130
Report!

303
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,220
My Lord,

304
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,770
Liu Yan has taken Xiaogang by surprise.

305
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,220
He's now sending 100,000 troops

306
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
toward Panyi.

307
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,730
How did he get to Xiaogang
in half a day?

308
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,730
What?

309
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,660
The Liangya army reached Xiaogang
in just half a day?

310
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,360
According to Wei Liang,

311
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,730
Liu Yan discovered a secret path

312
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,060
between Xiaogang and Liancheng.

313
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,220
I must inform the Lord
of the secret path.

314
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,610
No need.

315
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,460
I already know.

316
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,490
Xiaotao, leave us.

317
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,260
I need to talk with the Lord.

318
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,010
You said we needed to talk?

319
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,650
Go ahead.

320
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,250
I asked Bi Zhi

321
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,620
to secretly build that secret path

322
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,980
under the pretense of mining.

323
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
I don't know if you still remember.

324
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,940
When

325
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,700
I took Boya,

326
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,940
you went off to attack Xiaogang.

327
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,700
I built the secret path

328
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,180
to set up a defense line.

329
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,220
So, are you saying

330
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,620
it's my fault?

331
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,730
It's my fault.

332
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,220
I never wanted you

333
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,490
to be badly hurt today.

334
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,530
But right now,

335
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,570
we should first figure out
how to repel the enemy.

336
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,910
If you want to punish me later,

337
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,650
I can bear it.

338
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,570
Repel the enemy?

339
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,530
Where can we repel them?

340
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,010
Liu Yan is attacking Yanzhou

341
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,950
and then marching on Wei

342
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,980
through your secret path.

343
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,390
Where do you want me to repel them?

344
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,770
I never thought

345
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,290
you'd be so wary of me.

346
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,530
What do you mean?

347
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
Do you doubt my feelings for you?

348
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,140
That secret path was built before,

349
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,570
not now.

350
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,330
You claimed you wanted
to kill the Qiao Clan.

351
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,980
We married under such circumstances.

352
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,490
How could I not guard against you?

353
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,660
But at Grandmother's birthday banquet,

354
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,220
when you said you trusted me,

355
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,620
I knew I had long fallen for you.

356
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,860
You know everything after that.

357
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,140
Yet you never intended to tell me this.

358
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,850
Yes.

359
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,860
You were afraid of me
when you married me,

360
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,800
so you were wary of me.

361
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,980
Yet when you loved me,

362
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,490
you still didn't want to tell me.

363
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
I've always thought I was a cold man.

364
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm grateful you came to warm me.

365
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,460
But I never expected

366
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,220
I'm not the only one
who can't be melted.

367
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,380
Have you truly let go

368
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,730
of the desire for revenge then?

369
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,090
If you hadn't married me,

370
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,940
would you still refuse
to attack Yanzhou?

371
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,570
How can you say that?

372
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,760
I accompanied you
to honor your grandfather.

373
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,660
I sent gifts to your cousin.

374
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,700
I mingled with your family
like a relative.

375
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,180
How can you say that to me?

376
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,010
Did you do all that
because you married me

377
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,330
and wanted to please me,

378
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,700
or because you have let go
of your hatred?

379
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,900
That deep hatred?

380
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,010
That was merciful of you

381
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,090
to overlook my background

382
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,810
and marry me.

383
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,290
But feelings can change.

384
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,940
What if one day you tire of me

385
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,320
and want to wipe out the Qiao Clan?

386
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,530
If you say those words again,

387
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,460
I'll take Yanzhou first

388
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,520
and then wipe out Liangya.

389
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,700
This is

390
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,420
indeed my fault.

391
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,770
But if I don't tell you

392
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,730
these things,

393
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,530
I fear you'll only doubt me more.

394
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,460
The sun and moon can bear witness
to my feelings for you.

395
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,700
For you, I would give everything,

396
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,460
- even my life.
- Enough.

397
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,090
We're facing a great enemy.

398
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,620
The enemy hasn't even attacked,

399
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,100
yet we're already hurting ourselves.

400
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,700
You've always been eloquent.

401
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,430
If you want me to save Yanzhou,

402
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,770
you can say whatever you want.

403
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,980
My Lord.

404
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,820
Rest assured.

405
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,860
Only Wei Liang and a few others
know of this.

406
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,040
Your reputation will remain intact.

407
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,220
My Lady,

408
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,660
the Lord is waiting outside.

409
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,050
Ask him to come in.

410
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,090
Yes.

411
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,500
Sorry to disturb you so late.

412
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,350
This is important.

413
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,330
Have a seat.

414
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,460
Let's play a game of Go first.

415
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,900
Look at this game.

416
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,330
Make your move.

417
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,300
Before,

418
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,090
I played Go with Lady Qiao once.

419
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,010
I told her

420
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
that when a couple lives together,

421
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,220
there's no need to keep score.

422
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,810
Look at today's game.

423
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,900
It's the endgame from last time.

424
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,460
Grandmother,

425
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,250
I came so late

426
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,620
for an urgent matter.

427
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
Liu Yan has split his forces

428
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,380
to attack Panyi
and Liancheng separately.

429
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,490
Because of the canal repairs,

430
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,700
our forces have weakened.

431
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,940
He's forcing me to make a choice.

432
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,330
So,

433
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,980
what will you decide?

434
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,380
Panyi concerns

435
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,380
the water source of the Yongning Canal,

436
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,460
which is vital to Wei's survival.

437
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,730
Liancheng

438
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,010
is crucial for Yanzhou's fate.

439
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,010
For state affairs,

440
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,420
we allied with the Qiao Clan.

441
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,570
We agreed to jointly defend
the Yongning Canal.

442
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,250
For personal affairs,

443
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,330
Yanzhou is Lady Qiao's hometown.

444
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,660
It's hard to let go.

445
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,900
Do you have other reservations?

446
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,490
I have a question.

447
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,980
Can we really send troops

448
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,140
to help the Qiao Clan?

449
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,460
Can we truly put aside

450
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,940
all the past blood feuds?

451
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,530
Of course.

452
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,980
If we don't send troops now,

453
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,730
how are we different

454
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,010
from Lord Qiao

455
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,460
who broke his promises back then?

456
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,860
You don't have to worry about me.

457
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,770
When I accepted this marriage,

458
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,220
I already prepared myself for this day.

459
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,660
Let's repay hatred with kindness.

460
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,490
My Lady,

461
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,810
are you still upset?

462
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,180
Duang told me today

463
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,180
that the Lord stopped monitoring
your letters long ago.

464
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,620
It means he truly loves

465
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,090
and trusts you.

466
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,810
He's sincere with me,

467
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,330
but I never trusted him.

468
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,140
I was the one who upset him.

469
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,250
I have Yanzhou to defend,

470
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,530
and he has Wei to protect.

471
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,940
If he wants to give up Liancheng,

472
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,490
I won't blame him.

473
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,930
My Lady,

474
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,090
just now, Nanny Zhong sent a message:

475
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,660
The Lord is sending troops
to help Liancheng.

476
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,860
Mother,

477
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,700
did you hear that right?

478
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,330
He's helping Liancheng,

479
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,700
not attacking it?

480
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,940
Come on.

481
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,460
How could I have heard it wrong?

482
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,570
They said they'd leave
at the Chen hour tomorrow.

483
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,730
My Lady, let me do this.

484
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,290
Don't strain your eyes.

485
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm fine.

486
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,700
After I leave with the Lord,

487
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,140
you must patrol

488
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,380
day and night,

489
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,420
keep guard seriously,

490
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,280
and don't slack off.

491
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,330
Yes.

492
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,080
Duang.

493
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,980
Xiaotao.

494
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,620
Let me wipe your shield.

495
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,090
Here.

496
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,700
Don't worry.

497
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,050
I'm good at fighting.

498
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,010
I won't get hurt.

499
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,050
When you're on the battlefield,

500
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,220
be brave to kill the enemy,

501
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,290
and take back Liancheng.

502
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,740
Liancheng, Liancheng...

503
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,280
You're always talking about Liancheng.

504
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,430
Aren't you worried about me?

505
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,480
Of course, I am.

506
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,490
The Lord's right.

507
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,290
You Yanzhou girls...

508
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,050
What about us?

509
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,290
What's wrong with Yanzhou girls?

510
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,310
Last night, the Lady stayed up all night
sewing the Lord's battle boots.

511
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,140
Her eyes even became red.

512
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,050
Fine.

513
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,090
You could just give it to me.

514
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,220
Why wipe my shield?

515
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,090
That's tiring.

516
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,700
What's wrong?

517
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,420
You...

518
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,090
Come back safe, okay?

519
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,220
I'm waiting for you

520
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,140
to ask for the Lady's approval
for my marriage.

521
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,220
Who wants to marry you?

522
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
The shield.

523
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,010
Don't worry.

524
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,660
I've got your safety charm.

525
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,750
Even if I get injured,

526
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,770
I'll come back and ask
for your mother's approval.

527
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,490
Pah, pah, pah.

528
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,940
You won't get injured.

529
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,700
Pah, pah, pah. I won't get injured.

530
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,900
Pah, pah, pah.

531
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,380
He won't get injured,

532
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,460
but it's time to set off.

533
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,420
You three,

534
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,700
stay safe too.

535
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,340
(Wei)

536
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,860
What are you doing here?

537
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,930
The road to the battlefield is long.

538
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,380
I sewed a pair of battle boots for you.

539
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,140
Now, the soldiers of Wei

540
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,490
will fight for Yanzhou.

541
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,490
Are you satisfied now?

542
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,460
Your forces are far fewer
than Liangya's.

543
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,660
If Liu Yan brings reinforcements,

544
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,700
it'll only get worse.

545
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,770
But don't worry, My Lord.

546
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,250
I'll go to Boya
to ask for reinforcements

547
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,330
and guard your rear.

548
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:05,700
(Wei)

549
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,900
I've decided

550
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,300
to protect both Panyi

551
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,210
and Yanzhou.

552
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,100
Wei Xiao.

553
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes.

554
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,790
You are in charge of guarding Yujun,

555
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,610
leading 50,000 stationed troops

556
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,010
to defend Yujun to the death.

557
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,010
Yes, My Lord.

558
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,570
Wei Qu, Wei Duo.

559
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

560
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,050
You two follow me

561
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,300
to Panyi

562
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,860
to repel the Liangya army.

563
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,980
Yes, My Lord.

564
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,700
Wei Liang.

565
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,190
Yes.

566
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,460
You lead 50,000 troops

567
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,490
to Liancheng.

568
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,130
Prepare to march immediately.

569
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,220
Yes, My Lord.

570
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,780
Bring the wine.

571
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,130
Lead the mighty men of the Wei Clan

572
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,460
to the battlefield.

573
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,860
I await your victorious return.

574
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,150
Grandmother, don't worry.

575
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,210
I will

576
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,210
return soon.

577
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,170
You won't return until we triumph!

578
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,980
We won't return until we triumph!

579
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,530
We won't return until we triumph!

580
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,130
We won't return until we triumph!

581
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,090
Zhonglin,

582
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,050
you were born blessed.

583
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,460
The day before you were born,

584
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,340
I saw a strange omen

585
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,780
of a celestial deer.

586
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,210
That's when I knew

587
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,610
you were destined for greatness.

588
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,780
I know

589
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,420
you will triumph.

590
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,940
I'll be at home,

591
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,340
waiting for your return.

592
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,380
Don't worry, Mother.

593
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,780
Help Lady Zhu leave.

594
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,050
My Lady, slowly.

595
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,890
Slowly.

596
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,260
Let's go.

597
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,170
My Lord, please see the Lady once more.

598
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,800
Sir, when did you become so sentimental?

599
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,680
He can see her
when we come back with triumph.

600
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,570
How unseemly.

601
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,410
It's...

602
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,010
Very unseemly.

603
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,620
Let's go.

604
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,060
(Wei)

605
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,340
Grandmother, Mother.

606
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,260
I have a request

607
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,940
that I hope you will grant.

608
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,260
What is it?

609
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,340
I want to go to Boya.

610
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,130
Zhonglin just left.

611
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,090
He risked everything to send troops

612
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,490
to save Yanzhou,

613
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,170
and now you want to leave?

614
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,740
I'm not going for fun.

615
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,570
I want to go to Boya
to bring reinforcements.

616
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,530
This time, the Lord's forces are divided

617
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,260
to head to Liancheng and Panyi.

618
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,540
But we're outnumbered,

619
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,900
and the chance of victory is slim.

620
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,650
So, I want to bring help from Boya

621
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,690
to support the Lord.

622
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,980
I hope you two will allow it.

623
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,050
If you truly

624
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,340
bring reinforcements

625
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,300
and let Zhonglin return safely,

626
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,490
from then on,

627
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,740
I will grant all your wishes,

628
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,980
big or small,

629
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,490
in this household.

630
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,460
The road to Boya is far,

631
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,010
but for Zhonglin,

632
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,170
I must let you go.

633
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,260
I have 500 guards,

634
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,010
and I will send General Wei Xiao

635
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,420
to escort you.

636
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,940
With them by your side,

637
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,050
you can go to Boya

638
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,940
at ease.

639
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,580
Yes.

640
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,050
Go then.

641
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,650
Thank you, Grandmother, Mother.

642
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,900
I will not let you down.

643
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,210
Be careful on the road.

644
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,700
Xiaotao,

645
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,690
go to Kangjun and send word to Ci.

646
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,860
Tell him to support the Lord

647
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,570
in Liancheng.

648
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,340
With both forces,

649
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,460
we'll surely win.

650
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,210
My Lady, rest assured.

651
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,060
(Danjun, Bianzhou)

652
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,660
Young Master.

653
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,530
Liangya's troops

654
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,090
have besieged Panyi and Liancheng.

655
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,340
Bianzhou should help them asap.

656
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,130
Yanzhou and Wei are besieged,

657
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,860
but what's that got to do with Bianzhou?

658
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,010
Bianzhou and Wei are allies,

659
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,130
jointly building canals.

660
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,690
- We should help, right?
- Shiyuan.

661
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,610
This is the Chen Mansion

662
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,570
in Bianzhou.

663
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,090
You, a Chen,

664
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,540
should not favor Wei

665
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,400
in your words.

666
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,650
I'm a Wei, not a Chen.

667
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,670
- Young Master.
- You...

668
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,570
Lend me 100,000 troops.

669
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,090
I'll make up

670
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,420
for any losses.

671
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,740
Make up?

672
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,300
How?

673
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,980
With the Wei people?

674
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,610
Or the Yanzhou people?

675
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,330
Shiyuan,

676
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,480
even if you dared make up the numbers,

677
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,420
I wouldn't dare use them.

678
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,930
You...

679
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,170
We've won. Good job.

680
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,610
Generals, I toast to you.

681
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,610
Good, good.

682
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,130
Thanks to you,

683
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,740
Bianzhou

684
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,940
remains safe.

685
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,780
You flatter us.

686
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,620
- Here.
- Cheers.

687
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,300
The Lord was brave.

688
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,170
Why did he have

689
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,460
such a useless son?

690
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,310
What does that have to do with the Lord?

691
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,650
The Wei Clan from Wei should be blamed.

692
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,050
They let him live a loose life

693
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,300
and become a good-for-nothing.

694
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,420
He's not even a Chen, growing up in Wei.

695
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,380
How can he lead our army?

696
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,580
Anyway,

697
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,050
I will never

698
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,490
recognize him as my lord.

699
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
I'll go challenge him.

700
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,780
Mr. Wei,

701
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,850
you've been in Bianzhou
for a while now, right?

702
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,170
I'm wondering

703
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,690
if you can accept my challenge.

704
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,750
You're not worthy to be my rival.

705
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,180
I'll go.

706
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,260
You're only rake,

707
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,900
always using dirty tricks.

708
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,300
Why don't you come at me together?

709
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:29,580
What?

710
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,370
Do you want to take advantage
of my injury?

711
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,780
You're both virtuous and gifted.

712
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,570
We will obey your orders from now on.

713
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,610
Young Master.
