30
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,100
You two,

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,770
I suggest you surrender.

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,970
This is Yanzhou.

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,620
How can a Liangya man be in charge?

34
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,330
Soldiers, you might not know,

35
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,539
but your governor

36
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,740
was killed in Panyi
by the Lord of Liangya.

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,210
Liangya is hiding this

38
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,930
to divide Yanzhou later.

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,450
Really?

40
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,420
My brother is dead?

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,210
Qiao Yue is dead.

42
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,930
So, the prefect is

43
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,020
the governor now.

44
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,180
Are you sure

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,330
you want to fight him now?

46
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,410
Don't listen to him.

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,570
Seize these two immediately.

48
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,350
The Lord of Liangya
offers a heavy reward.

49
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,010
The Wei army will soon crush Panyi.

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,960
The Lord of Liangya
can barely protect himself,

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,810
let alone you.

52
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,579
Think carefully.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,860
Will you listen to a Liangya man

54
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,810
or your prefect?

55
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,940
What should we do now?

56
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,810
Yeah.

57
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,250
Exactly.

58
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,210
What should we do?

59
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,300
What now?

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,810
Soldiers.

61
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,530
My brother

62
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,210
has been foolish for too long,

63
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,770
which led Yanzhou to this state.

64
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,460
If you don't betray me,

65
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,740
I won't

66
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,860
let your trust down.

67
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,930
Is the governor really dead?

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,810
I heard the same.

69
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,140
Even if he isn't,

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,300
I support the prefect.

71
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,740
The people believe him.

72
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,650
I support the prefect.

73
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,579
Me too.

74
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,810
Are you planning to rebel?

75
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,770
Seize that Liangya man.

76
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,530
Pass on my order:

77
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,360
Yanzhou will no longer

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,420
cooperate with Liangya.

79
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,900
Order Liancheng

80
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,090
to mobilize all troops

81
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,810
and retake Panyi.

82
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,460
Yes.

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,250
Prepare the finest coffin

84
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,930
for General Wei Liang.

85
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,810
Yes.

86
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,840
(The Governor of Yanzhou has defected,
planning to retake Panyi)

87
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,620
What can Qiao Ping do?

88
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,740
It's like an ant shaking a tree.

89
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,980
My Lord, you'll surely win.

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,940
However,

91
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,540
we can't

92
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,060
act rashly.

93
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,340
We have Daqiao.

94
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,980
Without Bi Zhi,

95
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,900
Yanzhou is not a threat.

96
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,180
Besides,

97
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,460
I have a special gift

98
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,780
for Wei Shao.

99
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,659
(Yujun City, Wei State)

100
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,460
My Lady,

101
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,420
Yujun lacks troops as expected.

102
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,660
Give me half a month,

103
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,040
and we can break through the gates.

104
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,900
You really are a fierce general.

105
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,780
Try your best to attack
with the Zhongzhou army.

106
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,420
Deputy Liu Xiao and 5,000 elite troops

107
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
will be under my command

108
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,540
to conserve our strength.

109
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,240
Yujun's troops were outnumbered,

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,340
but each one fought bravely.

111
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,820
This battle was thrilling.

112
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,660
Their bravery didn't matter.

113
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,860
They still lost.

114
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,540
General, you don't know.

115
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,700
The real thrill

116
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,060
is here.

117
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,370
(Trapped in Yongning)

118
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,180
Wei Shao was trapped
in Yongning City for days

119
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,540
with reduced forces.

120
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,700
Two days ago, he broke out,

121
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,340
leading his leftover troops

122
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,700
to Panyi.

123
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,500
Wei Shao actually gave up Yujun

124
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,620
for Panyi?

125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,020
Guess what would happen

126
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,020
if Lady Qiao knew
where Wei Shao had gone

127
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,980
when Yujun was under attack?

128
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,780
The Lord didn't abandon us.

129
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,380
He did what a lord should do.

130
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,580
Zhonglin has his mission.

131
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
Yujun

132
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,860
is counting on us now.

133
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,580
But Yujun's not the only one
that's trapped.

134
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,900
They're seriously outnumbered in Panyi.

135
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,180
It's extremely dangerous.

136
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,380
If I can buy the Lord some time

137
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,900
and hold back some troops,

138
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,860
he can take Panyi,

139
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,220
and peace will return.

140
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,380
But Yujun

141
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,100
already lacks troops.

142
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,780
It might not hold out much longer.

143
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,220
Well...

144
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,820
My Lady.

145
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
How's the battle going?

146
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,140
General Wei Xiao, General Qiao Ci, and I

147
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,380
are guarding three city gates,

148
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,900
but Xue Tai's forces are strong,

149
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,720
and there's no capable commander
in the city.

150
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,240
I fear we won't be able
to hold out for long.

151
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,220
What should we do?

152
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,320
Who says there's no capable commander
in the city?

153
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,660
I understand your concern
for the Wei Clan,

154
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,500
so I didn't take the chance
to attack Wei.

155
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Don't make

156
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,980
more requests.

157
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,300
Young Master.

158
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,580
Please leave.

159
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,540
We have sworn to follow you

160
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,620
so we'll only obey your orders.

161
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,100
We'll only obey your orders.

162
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,740
We're ready to go to battle with you.

163
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,780
Grandmother,

164
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,060
I'm back.

165
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,420
Shiyuan.

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,620
Shiyuan!

167
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,340
Shiyuan.

168
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,100
Shiyuan is back.

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,540
Lady Xu of the Wei Clan,

170
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,580
today,

171
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,260
Wei and Bianzhou

172
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,620
have formed an alliance

173
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,220
over the canal project.

174
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,220
Now,

175
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,300
with Yujun under siege,

176
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
I hope you can provide troops for me

177
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,820
to fight outside the city

178
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,060
and defend Yujun together.

179
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,500
Good.

180
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,940
Good!

181
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,140
I will give you troops.

182
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,419
Shiyuan,

183
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,340
you truly are the blood

184
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,220
of the Wei Clan.

185
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,540
(Wei Mansion)

186
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,620
Who are they?

187
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,000
They are soldiers from Bianzhou

188
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,420
coming to help Yujun with me.

189
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,700
They belong to Chen Pang?

190
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,660
Yes.

191
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,020
In the rush to help Yujun,

192
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,260
I neglected this.

193
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,620
If you care about their identities,

194
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,580
I will send them back.

195
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,420
Shiyuan.

196
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,020
Bianzhou and Wei

197
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,100
have old grudges,

198
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,380
but that's personal
between Chen Pang and me.

199
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,460
Today, all of you

200
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,020
(Wei Mansion)
followed Shiyuan here,

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,780
risking your lives

202
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,140
to support Yujun.

203
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,540
You are the saviors of Wei.

204
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,180
Please accept

205
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,860
my gratitude.

206
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,860
We chose to follow Mr. Wei,

207
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,500
so we'll do our utmost

208
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,740
to live up to your trust.

209
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,740
Please rise, everyone.

210
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Grandmother,

211
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm going.

212
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,660
Be careful.

213
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,140
(Wei Mansion)

214
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,580
Let's hope they can return safely,

215
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,140
and eternal peace may come.

216
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,940
When the Lord triumphs,

217
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,140
the grand scene you spoke of

218
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,260
will surely come true.

219
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,300
(Panyi City, Yanzhou)

220
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,980
(Qiao)

221
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,540
(Qiao)

222
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,340
Hyah.

223
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,860
(Panyi)

224
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,940
Hyah.

225
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,220
Whoa.

226
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,820
Do we

227
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,420
have to fight today?

228
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,260
You treat me like family,

229
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
but I have to fight against you

230
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,220
because my wife

231
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,460
is held hostage.

232
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,300
Bi Zhi!

233
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Wei Shao.

234
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,860
My Lord, ignore our relationship.

235
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,540
Attack.

236
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,420
Bi Zhi,

237
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,580
what are you waiting for?

238
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,260
Strike!

239
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Bi Zhi, no!

240
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,980
Bi Zhi is a fitting name.

241
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,020
He's like

242
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,340
a filthy animal.

243
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,060
Look.

244
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,140
Does he look like a beast,

245
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,460
mindlessly controlled by others?

246
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,740
Bi Zhi,

247
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,580
if you don't hurt Wei Shao,

248
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,220
I'll hurt your wife instead.

249
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,020
How can you do this to him?

250
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,140
We can only do this to him

251
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,060
because of you.

252
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,340
Let go!

253
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,540
(Yujun City, Wei)

254
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,620
Kill them!

255
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,300
General Xue is dead!

256
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,420
Run!

257
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,500
General Xue is dead!

258
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,420
Run!

259
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,160
Retreat!

260
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,100
Retreat!

261
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,260
(Yujun)

262
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,100
That green-eyed beast

263
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,540
really is fierce.

264
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,780
My Lord,

265
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,300
if Bi Zhi always serves you,

266
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,500
I believe

267
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,420
the realm

268
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,740
will eventually be yours.

269
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,860
Fierce or not,

270
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,180
he's just a wild animal.

271
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,020
Yes.

272
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,420
Bi Zhi,

273
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,820
if you don't disable his limbs,

274
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,460
I'll break your wife's.

275
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,340
Bi Zhi!

276
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,340
Stop being their puppet!

277
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,380
Don't mind me!

278
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,060
Bi Zhi is brave.

279
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,460
If the world is divided,

280
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,820
he'll surely have a place.

281
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,900
Sadly...

282
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
Sadly, he's foolish

283
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,660
to be tied down by a woman.

284
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,220
Don't talk like that about him.

285
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,180
Fool!

286
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,780
If you don't do it,

287
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,460
I'll push her down!

288
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,420
Do it!

289
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,540
I'll push her down!

290
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,060
Bi Zhi!

291
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,420
Bi Zhi, stop fighting!

292
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,940
Because in this world,

293
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,100
no one says we must always do
the right thing.

294
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,940
Manman.

295
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,860
I'd die for you

296
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,940
because you're my dearest cousin.

297
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,100
But I can't

298
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,620
ask Bi Zhi to die for you.

299
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,540
I can't use love to force him

300
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,740
to protect my family,

301
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,900
even you.

302
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,740
I won't regret it.

303
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,300
I can't use love to force him

304
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,060
and make him die

305
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,180
for my family

306
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,860
or even me.

307
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,000
The only person I want to protect

308
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,940
has always been just you.

309
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,940
I will never regret it.

310
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,660
Bi Zhi!

311
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,500
You're my lover,

312
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,060
not a beast to be controlled.

313
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,220
Darling,

314
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,420
if you ever

315
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,860
think back on today,

316
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,420
just remember:

317
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,140
I never regret it.

318
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,980
Don't jump!

319
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,180
Fan...

320
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,140
Fan...

321
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,060
Fan...

322
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,660
Fan...

323
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,940
Fan, wake up.

324
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,300
I don't want to be some commander.

325
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
Fan,

326
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,100
don't die.

327
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,460
Please don't die.

328
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,820
If you die,

329
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,140
what should Li and I do?

330
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,620
As long as you come back,

331
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,300
I'll do anything.

332
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,100
Fan!

333
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,660
Fan!

334
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,060
Fan!

335
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Liu Yan,

336
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,300
I will make you

337
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,140
pay in blood!

338
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,540
I thought you could hold on longer,

339
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,780
but it seems you're useless after all.

340
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,860
So what if you two join forces?

341
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,700
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

342
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,020
That's more than enough

343
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,500
to handle you.

344
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,300
Xue Tai is dead.

345
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,180
Liangya is defeated.

346
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,660
Everyone, run for your lives!

347
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,340
Retreat!

348
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,300
Run!

349
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,540
- Retreat!
- Run!

350
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,540
Hurry, move faster!

351
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,100
- She's coming back!
- Yes!

352
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Hurry. There's also this.

353
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,100
Pack this up.

354
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,100
You want to betray me too?

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
We outnumber her.

356
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,420
No need to fear her.

357
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,980
Xue Tai is dead.

358
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,300
No one can protect her now.

359
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,460
Let's go

360
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,420
and kill her.

361
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,500
What are you doing?

362
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,660
How dare you!

363
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,940
What are you doing?

364
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,620
What are you doing?

365
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,620
She's really disfigured!

366
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,780
She's disfigured!

367
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,860
Your face...

368
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,180
Your face is ruined!

369
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,220
She's really disfigured!

370
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,460
You've all seen it.

371
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,340
Don't expect to live.

372
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,940
None of you can survive.

373
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,300
Be careful!

374
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,020
Don't kill me.

375
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,420
Lady Yulou.

376
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,260
Lady Yulou...

377
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
Why?

378
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
You've seen

379
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,580
my face.

380
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm here to escort you away.

381
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,460
No need.

382
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,940
No need.

383
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,420
If Liu Yan knew

384
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,380
I looked like this now...

385
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,620
The Lord already knows.

386
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,900
Lady Yulou,

387
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,140
everything you eat, wear,

388
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,580
and use in Liangya

389
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,500
was arranged by the Lord.

390
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
How long

391
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,820
could you have kept it a secret?

392
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
The Lord said

393
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,420
if we lost this battle,

394
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,900
I should escort you to a safe place.

395
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,300
He's arranged an escape for you.

396
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,820
You...

397
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,740
Impossible.

398
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,580
You said no one in this world
cared for you,

399
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,260
but my brother loved you.

400
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,340
Impossible.

401
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,700
He cherished you.

402
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,220
When he was dying,

403
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,980
he entrusted me to take care of you.

404
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,580
Chen Xiang

405
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
truly cared for you.

406
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,860
He built you a tall tower

407
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,060
and indulged you
in seeking profits for Wushan.

408
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,140
Impossible.

409
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,980
Liu Yan's love for me can't be real.

410
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,060
You ignore all these acts

411
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,140
of kindness.

412
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,540
Instead of blaming the world
for being unfair,

413
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,380
you should think about why you ignore

414
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,140
and shut out the care of others.

415
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,630
It's over.

We've won

427
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,220
this battle.

428
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,540
We've won.

429
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,380
Well done.

430
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,220
(May the Lord win.)

431
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,620
Kill them!

432
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,980
Kill them!

433
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,860
Hold the flanks.

434
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,700
Don't let them climb up.

435
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,540
Yes.

436
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,300
My Lord.

437
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,060
Bi Zhi and Wei Shao have gone mad.

438
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,980
This place isn't safe.

439
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,260
You should retreat to the rear.

440
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,340
What?

441
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,000
Do you think my army is weaker
than Wei Shao's?

442
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,340
No.

443
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,700
We outnumber Wei Shao's forces

444
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,020
by several times.

445
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,180
Even facing him head-on,

446
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,580
I'm not afraid.

447
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,300
Of course, you're not afraid.

448
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,540
But you needn't get hurt over this.

449
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,300
If you hadn't sent 5,000 guards

450
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,020
and General Liu Xiao
to protect the Lady,

451
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,340
I wouldn't be this worried.

452
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,740
You don't want me to favor the Lady?

453
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,220
Women pampered grow arrogant.

454
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,540
Please listen to my advice.

455
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,380
Shut up.

456
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,500
I swore to the Lady

457
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,940
that I'd kill Wei Shao in this battle.

458
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,540
Foolish.

459
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,420
Whoever conquers the world

460
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,180
cannot be controlled by a woman.

461
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
- Guards!
- Yes!

462
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,020
Take the Lord away.

463
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
Move aside!

464
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,740
I told you

465
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,500
that my uncle is dead.

466
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,620
If you can't accept that,

467
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,180
then go die.

468
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,820
If I kill Wei Shao,

469
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,740
the realm will be mine.

470
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,540
I'll be the Lord of Central Plains.

471
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,140
Soldiers of Wei are fierce.

472
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,380
Wei Shao,

473
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,020
even if you kill me,

474
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,020
Wei will still drown in floods.

475
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,020
You can't win against me.

476
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,900
You can't win!

477
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
My Lady,

478
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,540
I have broken my promise.

479
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,620
When all states prosper,

480
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,020
the world will have peace.

481
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,760
The water from the Yang River
is accessible

482
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,920
thanks to the Yongning Canal,

483
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,940
which runs

484
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,420
over 700 li,

485
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,900
chasing the sun across the sky.

486
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,100
The mighty stag

487
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,940
leaves north and goes south

488
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,500
straight to Yujun.

489
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,180
The mountains and rivers
stretch across the world,

490
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,620
nurturing all living things.

491
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,380
It's misty, yet there's no smoke.

492
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,300
With the sun and moon reflecting in it,

493
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,300
the spiritual energy from all directions

494
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,820
gathers on Central Plains,

495
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
turning swords and blades

496
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,780
to dust.

497
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,020
The canal links nine states.

498
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,340
It starts at Panyi,

499
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,100
goes through Xindu,

500
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,940
and stops at Rongjun,

501
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,020
improving the traffic condition,

502
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,940
encouraging peace,
and driving away the spiteful.

503
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,460
The next year after the completion,

504
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,980
Wei Shao, Lord of Wei,

505
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,580
and Liu Yan, Lord of Liangya,

506
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,980
fought here.

507
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,180
Scattered scars

508
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,340
were lost in the long river.

509
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,260
Good.

510
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,340
Master Zhenshi,

511
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,140
this poetic exposition

512
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,580
is a masterpiece.

513
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,300
But the 700 li

514
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,220
was from Panyi to Xindu.

515
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,220
Now that it reaches Rongjun,

516
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,700
it's probably over 2,000 li.

517
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,130
Not to mention

518
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,860
the full length to other states.

519
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,300
My Lord, if you're not satisfied,

520
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,980
shall I write another exposition

521
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,780
detailing the battle at Panyi that day?

522
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,860
No need.

523
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,740
These two lines

524
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,780
are enough.

525
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,900
Your exposition is so excellent

526
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,820
that deserves to be carved
on stone tablets.

527
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,220
But many things

528
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,100
shouldn't be depicted in detail.

529
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,540
No matter how fierce the war was,

530
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,540
people tend to remember

531
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,940
the beautiful memories

532
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,500
and those they truly liked.

533
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,260
How wise and insightful.

534
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,620
Your words make sense.

535
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
Tomorrow,

536
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,740
we'll offer the deer as a gift

537
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,300
to honor Wei as the leader.

538
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,940
My Lord,

539
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,900
please don't refuse.

540
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,900
We'll honor Wei as the leader.

541
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,380
Alright.

542
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,260
I won't fail your trust.

543
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,420
I will lead the people

544
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,140
and create lasting peace.

(Yujun)

547
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,580
I heard

548
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,060
Chen Pang failed to bring Mr. Wei

549
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,620
back to his family before he died.

550
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,100
It's a pity

551
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,420
he died of asthma.

552
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,340
That was mercy for him.

553
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,660
Shiyuan is now the Lord of Bianzhou.

554
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,340
Don't mention

555
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,140
these things again.

556
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,780
Yes.

557
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,060
Whoa.

558
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,060
Grandmother.

559
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,060
Shiyuan.

560
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,660
Congratulations on the succession.

561
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,900
May Bianzhou and Wei

562
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,420
remain forever friendly

563
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,540

593
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,139
we brought good wine

I water it

00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,020
every day.

602
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,179
It's growing well now.

603

I'm the one bringing the orchid

to propose to you.

these little weapons

613
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,740
represent us.

614
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,220
We weren't born on the same day

615
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,980
and probably

616
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,220
won't die on the same day.

617
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,740
But one day,

618
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,500
if we're all gone,

619
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,740
with these weapons buried together,

620
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,260
we'll always be brothers.

621
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,340
Seeing it

622
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,380
will be like seeing me.

623
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,980
Is this a sign

624
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,500
to stop fighting?

625
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,700
How did you manage to say that
in such a circumstance?

626
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,380
Sir.

627
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,340
Has the Lord been found?

628
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,480
He's not at the office.

629
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,700
Sir.

630
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,000
Not the training ground.

631
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,380
Sir.

632
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,220
Lady Xu also said

633
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,260
she hadn't seen the Lord.

634
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,840
The deer offering ritual
is about to start.

635
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,540
Without the Lord,

636
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,860
how can the ritual be completed?

637
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,700
Go fetch Lady Xu.

638
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,940
Only she can accept the deer

639
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,220
on behalf of the Lord.

640
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,540
- Hurry.
- Yes.

641
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,140
Don't cry.

642
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Stop crying.

643
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,140
Don't cry.

644
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,020
The ritual has started.

645
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,580
Mr. Gongsun couldn't find you

646
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,060
and brought Grandmother there.

647
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,940
- Why are you here?
- Well.

648
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,220
Feifei has been crying nonstop.

649
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,420
I couldn't go.

650
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,340
Alright.

651
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Good girl.

652
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,180
Come on.

653
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,900
Go to your mother.

654
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,820
Don't cry.

655
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,860
You're amazing.

662
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,380
(can be understood another way.)

663
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,140
(Whether it's to live a life)

664
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,700
(or conquer the world,)

665
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,580
(both sides working together)

666
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,540

669
