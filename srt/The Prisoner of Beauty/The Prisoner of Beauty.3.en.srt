Do you think I'm easy to fool?

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,060
The Qiaos are too naive,

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,460
wanting this engagement

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,250
to offset fourteen years of hatred.

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,340
Do you truly believe your beauty alone

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,140
could enchant me?

36
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,060
That old fox Qiao Gui

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,930
played his cards well,

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,580
sending a granddaughter here

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,210
to act all gentle and sweet

40
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,810
just to trick me
into allying with Yanzhou.

41
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,180
He fooled my grandfather
in the same way back then.

42
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,090
Let me tell you,

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,650
we won't fall for

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,580
the Qiaos' tricks again.

45
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,140
Lord Wei,

46
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,090
are you breaking off the engagement?

47
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,580
No.

48
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,180
I'm just exposing your robbery-like deal.

49
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,460
For the sake of this seal,

50
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,690
I'll spare your life.

51
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,690
However,

52
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,530
pack your things immediately

53
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,690
and get out of Xindu.

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,420
Oh,

55
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,650
and tell your family to wash their necks

56
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,240
and wait. I'm coming for them.

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,770
- Guards.
- Here.

58
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,020
Drag her out.

59
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,210
Don't touch me!

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,740
I misjudged you.

61
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,940
(Yuyang Courtyard)
Everyone, hurry up!

62
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,700
General, what exactly is going on?

63
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,020
Why are you taking my quilt?

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,900
Give it back.

65
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,260
Mom, why are they taking our things?

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,010
- What's going on?
- What happened?

67
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,900
- Hurry up!
- Stop!

68
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,140
That's my chest.

69
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,610
Wait.

70
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,460
What are you doing?

71
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,500
We're moving things out.

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,700
By whose orders?

73
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,290
Mom, take this and that chest.

74
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,170
- Quickly!
- Yes.

75
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,140
- Hold on.
- Yes.

76
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Wei...

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,090
Don't move, don't move.

78
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,340
Wei...

79
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,610
Duang.

80
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,500
Duang who?

81
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,650
My name is Wei Liang.

82
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,970
Whatever.

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,610
Why are you taking our things?

84
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,650
General Wei Liang.

85
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,700
Didn't we agree we would discuss marriage?

86
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,500
Why are you expelling us from Xindu?

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,940
So many questions.

88
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,460
- Take these away.
- Hurry up!

89
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,460
Come on.

90
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,580
- Hurry.
- Get up.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,380
Take it away.

92
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,970
What are you doing?

93
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,290
Stop, Xiaotao.

94
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,290
- Stop, Xiaotao.
- Stop.

95
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,970
- Let go, Let go.
- Don't fight.

96
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,260
General Wei Duang.

97
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,110
What Wei Duang?

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,170
It's Wei Liang. Wei Liang!

99
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,580
There must be some misunderstanding.

100
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,460
Miss Xiaoqiao has gone to see Lord Wei.

101
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,380
Surely soon,

102
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,260
Lord Wei will order the marriage.

103
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,780
Expelling you from Xindu

104
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,050
was exactly his order.

105
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,210
This chubby girl is quite strong.

106
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,050
What?

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,850
Hurry and send them away.

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,900
I...

109
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,500
Why are they expelling us?

110
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,780
No idea.

111
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
Miss Xiaoqiao fell into their trap.

112
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,900
How can I face the lord now?

113
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,970
What should we do?

114
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,340
What if Miss Xiaoqiao comes back?

115
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,460
Quick, load the carts.

116
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,300
Okay.

117
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,450
This, this...

118
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,490
Don't...

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,700
(Panyi Annals)

120
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,580
My Lord.

121
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,520
(Humanities; Situation)
This isn't good, right?

122
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,410
We've exchanged the Letter of Marriage.

123
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,290
We should proceed with
the marriage as agreed.

124
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,460
What's not good about it?

125
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,850
The Qiaos can break promises,

126
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,780
but our retraction is not allowed?

127
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,820
But they have already offered Panyi.

128
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,020
Even if they didn't offer it,

129
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,260
I could take it myself.

130
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,970
That's true.

131
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,970
Moreover,

132
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,460
she wasn't sincere in
offering it to me anyway.

133
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,460
She is just compromising

134
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,260
to bind me in marriage to her.

135
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,780
If I don't expel her,

136
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,260
they'll only push further.

137
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,820
Do they really think

138
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,700
this overwhelming hatred

139
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,970
can be wiped away so easily?

140
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,210
That makes perfect sense.

141
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,290
What do you think?

142
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,290
No problem.

143
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,580
Makes some sense.

144
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,900
- It's reasonable.
- Indeed.

145
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
But she is after all a woman.

146
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,210
Get out of Xindu!

147
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,580
Don't come back!

148

150
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
That's nonsense!

151
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
In family matters,

152
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,700
we must never let women decide.

153
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,780
Xiaotao.

154
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,730
The urgent matter now
is planning the next step.

155
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,290
Find a way to go to Panyi

156
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,410
and oppose Wei Shao.

157
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,850
Protect Miss Xiaoqiao!

158
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,020
Charge!

159
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,290
Kill them!

160
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,970
It's Young Master Liu.

161
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,410
He came to save us.

162
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,140
- Kill them.
- Kill the traitors!

163
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,380
Young Master?

164
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,260
Young Master, the Wei rebels
have been cleared.

165
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,700
He's not a good person either.

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,500
He might be here to take advantage.

167
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,140
Are we just going

168
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,260
from the frying pan

169
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,820
into the fire?

170
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,100
My Lady.

171
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,650
What should we do then?

172
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,660
Xiaoqiao,

173
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,700
I'm late.

174
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,090
Were you frightened?

175
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,580
Go check it out.

176
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,580
Yan.

177
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,440
Xiaoqiao.

178
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,290
I knew

179
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,140
- Xiaoqiao.
- you would come to save me.

180
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,980
Xiaoqiao, don't be afraid.

181
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,290
Am I not here now?

182
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,460
But...

183
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,220
it's all my fault.

184
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,860
I delayed the marriage between us

185
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,170
because of family matters.

186
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,740
Now I was driven out of Xindu
by Wei Shao.

187
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,330
Fortunately, you didn't abandon me

188
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,810
and was willing to come save me.

189
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,530
But I fear if Wei Shao
learns of your actions,

190
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,860
he might take it out on Liangya

191
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,900
and start a war.

192
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,530
That's not what I want.

193
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
Yan,

194
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,170
why don't we

195
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,140
take down Wei Shao in one move

196
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,020
to eliminate future troubles?

197
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,170
Xiaoqiao,

198
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
we are a fated couple,

199
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,780
sharing glory and shame.

200
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,060
For now,

201
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,500
let's first settle in Panyi,

202
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,810
then plan carefully.

203
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,690
But I lost Panyi's seal.

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
Xiaoqiao,

205
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,450
you are the seal.

206
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,740
With you here,

207
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,170
we can enter the city.

208
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,650
You're right.

209
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,480
You must be tired from travel.

210
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,810
Rest in the carriage first.

211
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,100
We'll depart immediately.

212
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,650
Okay.

213
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,570
She's just some dumped woman.

214
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,690
Why are you so hung up on her?

215
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,860
She's not some dumped woman.

216
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,290
She's a treasure in this world.

217
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,690
Rest assured, Uncle.

218
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,650
I won't forget our priority.

219
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,380
Good that you know.

220
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,010
Remember,

221
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,100
none of the Qiaos

222
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,900
are any good.

223
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,450
They judge people by their status.

224
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
In marrying you,

225
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,650
they wouldn't even offer 10,000 gold taels.

226
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,020
Yet in marring Wei Shao,

227
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,860
they gave away the entire Panyi.

228
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,810
My Lady, you learn and apply quickly.

229
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,020
Quite impressive.

230
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,220
Your hypocritical act

231
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,810
is the same as Lord Wei's.

232
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Xiaotao.

233
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,380
Looks real, right?

234
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Let's go.

235
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,660
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

236
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
Say that again.

237
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,260
Where's my sister?

238
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,380
She went back to Panyi
with Young Master Liu.

239
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,290
She sent me back

240
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,050
to report to her grandfather.

241
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,020
What did she say?

242
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,310
She said

243
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,290
Panyi is a gateway to Yanzhou.

244
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,170
She won't hand it over willingly.

245
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,780
Why bother?

246
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,650
Why compete with Wei Shao?

247
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,100
Even if Panyi is lost,

248
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,530
I wouldn't blame her.

249
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,690
- Indeed.
- This...

250
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,050
Why bother?

251
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,930
Yue,

252
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,170
we should send troops to Panyi

253
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,100
and bring Manman back.

254
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
This...

255
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,620
This isn't necessary.

256
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,900
Manman has a stubborn streak.

257
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,220
She can't be stopped.

258
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,250
But...

259
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,580
Aunt,

260
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,900
I won't fool around from now on.

261
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,450
I'll study hard.

262
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,140
I'm so incompetent

263
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,690
that I couldn't protect my two sisters.

264
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,450
Ci,

265
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,530
as long as you have ambition,

266
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,740
unlike

267
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,380
your weak-willed uncle,

268
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,500
you could become one of Yanzhou's finest.

269
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,940
(Outskirts of Yanzhou, Yanzhou)

270
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,290
Sit.

271
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,260
Have some water first.

272
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,450
I miss my mother somewhat.

273
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,410
Don't know how she is now.

274
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,860
I also miss my younger sister Manman.

275
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,810
These past few days,

276
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,290
I've thought many things through.

277
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,050
She must've lied about

278
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,650
wanting to marry Lord Wei.

279
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,330
I wonder how she's doing now.

280
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,250
Fan,

281
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,500
when passing by

282
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,550
a nearby teahouse, I heard

283
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,430
she was expelled from Xindu by Lord Wei.

284
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,500
She went toward Panyi with Liu Yan.

285
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,290
If you're worried,

286
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,020
let's go to Panyi to find her.

287
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,650
Or...

288
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,260
if you want to

289
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,780
reunite with family,

290
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,220
I can send you back to Kangjun.

291
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,840
As much as I want to stay with you,

292
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,050
I can't bear to see you

293
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,300
in tears every day.

294
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,010
Fan,

295
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,410
rest assured,

296
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,740
I'll always be there for you.

297
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,490
Bi Zhi,

298
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,100
then let's go to Panyi.

299
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,620
If you say Panyi,

300
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,930
then Panyi it is.

301
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,900
Things in Xindu are pretty much settled.

302
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Tell the soldiers,

303
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,100
we officially take over Panyi Tomorrow.

304
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

305
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,130
My Lord.

306
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,980
Why so flustered?

307
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,930
Report from Panyi,

308
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,650
Liangya's Young Master Liu Yan

309
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,650
has entered Panyi last night

310
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,220
and took over city defense.

311
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,100
What did he use to open the city gates?

312
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,020
Lady Qiao.

313
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
Which lady?

314
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,450
The one you drove out.

315
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,410
I should have killed her long ago.

316
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,810
Pass on my order.

317
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,810
Lady Qiao has eloped with Liu Yan

318
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,170
and are hiding in Panyi.

319
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,810
Tell the soldiers

320
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,810
to follow me in another battle.

321
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,860
Yes.

322
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,930
My Lord, wait.

323
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,170
In my view, this matter is suspicious.

324
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,050
We might get it wrong.

325
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,860
We should find Lady Qiao and ask her first.

326
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,290
You're right.

327
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,260
Find Lady Qiao

328
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,980
and kill her to boost morale.

329
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,890
Wake up.

330
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,380
Having nightmares?

331
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,290
I won't let this dream come true.

332
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,980
Have some water.

333
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,680
My Lady,

334
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,980
Young Master requests a meeting.

335
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,580
Young Master.

336
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,650
Xiaoqiao,

337
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,410
Xiaoqiao.

338
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,530
It was late yesterday,

339
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,050
and we only met briefly
before we hurried on.

340
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,050
Now that we've settled in Panyi,

341
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,660
I've come to speak with you

342
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,020
about our marriage.

343
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,980
I understand your intentions.

344
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,890
But such important matters

345
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,290
should not be rushed.

346
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,850
I need to consult

347
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,500
my uncle and father's opinions.

348
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,730
Can we discuss it

349
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,660
when we're back to Kangjun?

350
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,260
Miss Xiaoqiao,

351
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,460
let's not bother with

352
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,740
all these rules

353
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,220
at this point.

354
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,290
If we keep dragging on,

355
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,420
everyone will be exhausted.

356
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,700
In my opinion,

357
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,970
we'd better

358
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,790
keep it simple.

359
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,930
We've already asked
Panyi Mayor, Yang Feng

360
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,640
to represent Governor

361
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,600
and Prefect to receive the rites.

362
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,130
Simple, isn't it?

363
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,930
Isn't it perfect?

364
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,800
Now.

365
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,220
Here are betrothal gifts
from the Liangya royal family:

366
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,570
a pair of wild geese,

367
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,850
a pair of mandarin ducks,

368
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,420
one million coppers,

369
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,180
ten duan of silk,

370
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,610
ten duan of multicolored silk,

371
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,570
twelve hu of sake,

372
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,220
twelve hu of baijiu,

373
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,940
twelve hu of rice,

374
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,610
twelve hu of proso millet,

375
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,890
one lynx.

376
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,330
My uncle is a bit impatient.

377
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,330
But I'm to take control of Panyi,

378
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,370
I must marry you.

379
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,890
Only then will my claim be legitimate.

380
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,180
You're right.

381
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,290
I'll follow all your arrangements.

382
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,460
But I fear Wei Shao may come for revenge.

383
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,780
It might cause you trouble.

384
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
Rest assured.

385
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,890
I already have a perfect plan.

386
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,780
He's coming straight to his doom.

387
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,530
You rest well.

388
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,740
I won't disturb you further.

389
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,020
Guard strictly.

390
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,410
Close the gates.

391
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,220
Young Master.

392
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,500
Mayor, why are you here?

393
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,130
(Yang Feng, Panyi Mayor)

394
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,610
I heard Miss Xiaoqiao woke up.

395
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,890
I came to visit her.

396
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,570
She was badly frightened in Xindu.

397
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,660
Don't bother her unless necessary.

398
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,530
What if it is?

399
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,980
Then report to me.

400
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,530
I'll handle everything

401
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,810
for Panyi.

402
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,370
Good, there is one matter.

403
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,500
Thirty li away,

404
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,370
that Wei Shao...

405
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,460
That Wei rebel is leading troops here.

406
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,530
They will arrive soon.

407
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,530
He really came.

408
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,700
There's no chance for him to return alive.

409
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,050
Although

410
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,220
you used Lady Qiao's influence

411
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,420
to knock open Panyi's gates,

412
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,570
don't forget

413
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,530
that Wei boy

414
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,610
has Panyi's seal.

415
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,090
So

416
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,980
to completely block him outside,

417
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,330
we must mobilize the people's strength.

418
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,370
Stir them up.

419
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,810
Remember,

420
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,050
the people's power is limitless.

421
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,800
(Outskirts of Panyi, Yanzhou)

422
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,570
I heard that Wei Shao

423
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,530
has three eyes and four arms.

424
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,090
Four great generals under him

425
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,460
are all bloodthirsty.

426
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,180
If they break in,

427
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,660
they'll massacre the city.

428
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,090
He even chopped Li Su into pieces!

429
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,530
The Qiaos and Weis have generational enmity.

430
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,090
If we fall into his hands,

431
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,810
won't he skin us alive?

432
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,050
Don't let him enter the city.

433
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,540
- You're right.
- Yes.

434
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,050
With Liangya's Young Master Liu
helping defend,

435
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,260
plus our desperate fight,

436
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,780
- we definitely can win.
- Yes.

437
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,810
Young Master Liu.

438
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,610
He was chosen by Lord Qiao for Miss Xiaoqiao.

439
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,610
Liu Yan uses these rumors
to stir up civilians

440
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,960
to oppose Wei Shao.

441
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,780
To conquer the mind is no marvel.

442
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,300
But using common people to fight...

443
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,890
Isn't that somewhat unkind?

444
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,810
Greetings, Miss Xiaoqiao.

445
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
(Grain)

446
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,300
Is this the grain ordered
by Young Master Liu?

447
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,370
(Grain)
Indeed.

448
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,530
Why such a strong sulfur smell?

449
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,500
What's it used for?

450
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm just a humble mayor.

451
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,890
I can't possibly know what plans

452
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,260
Young Master Liu has.

453
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,940
Even you, miss.

454
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,810
He won't let me meet you.

455
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,090
Mayor Yang, you must be careful.

456
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,460
If he uses this thing to harm the people,

457
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,290
victory can be forgone
and Wei Shao can be spared,

458
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,700
but this must not be proceeded.

459
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,580
Yes.

460
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,810
Wasn't it you who built the Yongning Canal?

461
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,650
Indeed.

462
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,610
I haven't been there yet.

463
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,180
Can you show us the way?

464
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,370
No problem.

465
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,370
Just go straight ahead.

466
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,890
Xiaoqiao, why are you here?

467
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,330
The canal's been abandoned for years.

468
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,500
Nothing worth seeing.

469
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,810
I'm not here for the canal.

470
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,530
I went to the temple
for spirit inquiry.

471
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,100
Spirit inquiry?

472
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,050
About us?

473
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,290
About tomorrow's weather.

474
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,860
What did it say?

475
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,020
The wind will come from the southeast.

476
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,460
If you plan to use sulfur against Wei Shao,

477
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,980
remember to place sulfur southeast

478
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,240
for maximum fire effect.

479
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,560
You already know?

480
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,890
Fire attack is an unexpected tactic,

481
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,500
but you must be careful with it.

482
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,940
Don't misplace the direction

483
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,570
and harm the Panyi people.

484
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,660
You misunderstand me.

485
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,530
Panyi will be my territory.

486
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,780
They'll be my people.

487
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,700
How would I sacrifice them?

488
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,260
Then I overthought it.

489
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,610
Hope you won't mind.

490
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,260
What I seek

491
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,420
isn't just Wei Shao's life,

492
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,780
but the entire Wei State.

493
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,700
Fourteen years ago,

494
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,180
the Qiaos and Weis were friendly

495
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,950
and built the Yongning Canal together,

496
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,550
using Yanzhou water to irrigate Wei land.

497
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,390
After Xindu was captured,

498
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,940
Yongning Canal was abandoned by Li Su,

499
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,810
causing a great drought in Wei.

500
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,540
Xiaoqiao,

501
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,290
this Panyi Dam blocked water
for fourteen years.

502
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,940
If the water is released all at once,

503
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,180
what would happen to Xindu?

504
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,330
Yan,

505
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,530
the sulfur isn't used against Wei Shao

506
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,180
but used as explosives

507
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,940
to destroy the dam in Yongning Canal

508
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,460
and flood Xindu.

509
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,490
Then Wei suffers flood chaos.

510
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,290
It'll be a perfect timing to attack.

511
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,780
Wei Shao deserves death,

512
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,260
but the people are innocent.

513
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,090
It's for the greater good.

514
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,210
Blame it

515
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,260
on their being born in Wei.

516
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,260
So you only love

517
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,020
you own people.

518
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,290
When Panyi becomes my territory,

519
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,940
I'll love them as well.

520
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,980
Miss Xiaoqiao, why are you so anxious?

521
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,330
Did that single engagement with Wei Shao

522
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,090
make you believe

523
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,610
that you became part of Wei?

524
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,850
She just pities the people.

525
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,660
Even Wei Shao tore down the People's Wall

526
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,740
to comfort his people.

527
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,890
Your plan

528
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,740
is more cruel than the three-day massacre

529
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,610
of Li Su.

530
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,610
I plan all this for you, Xiaoqiao.

531
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,740
You and Wei Shao have deep hatred.

532
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,290
If I don't scheme against Wei today,

533
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,420
he'll flatten Yanzhou tomorrow.

534
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
He won't.

535
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,330
But you,

536
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,660
you're just using my name

537
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,500
to satisfy your own ambitions.

538
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:21,980
These days,

539
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,290
the city is unstable.

540
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,570
Better not wander around.

541
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,740
Escort my cousin back

542
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,810
and guard closely.

543
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,700
Though Panyi is Miss Xiaoqiao's dowry,

544
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,780
we still need to make it profitable.

545
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,940
Take her away.

546
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,780
Yes.

547
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,300
What are you doing?

548
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
Move.

549
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,610
What are you doing?

550
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,260
Young Master Liu ordered you to protect us.

551
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,090
He didn't mean to tie us up.

552
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,780
Shut up.

553
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,660
This is protection.

554
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,980
Think about it.

555
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,130
Once tied up,

556
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,980
you can't move.

557
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,810
What accidents would you have?

558
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,570
- What?
- This is the greatest protection.

559
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,980
What nonsense is this?

560
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,260
Untie us!

561
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,890
- Guard closely.
- Yes.

562
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,050
Pah.

563
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,810
My Lady, are you okay?

564
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,700
I thought Liu Yan would treat us politely.

565
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Who knows

566
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,810
he'd treat us like prisoners.

567
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,420
Might as well say Lord Wei was better.

568
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,220
Now you think Lord Wei is good?

569
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,420
Lord Wei though seems fierce

570
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,850
and speaks harshly,

571
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,050
he didn't tie us up.

572
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,850
He still expelled Miss Xiaoqiao from Xindu.

573
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,530
No matter what, Young Master Liu

574
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,740
only needs to treat Miss Xiaoqiao well.

575
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,460
It's not the time for this.

576
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,290
Think about how to escape

577
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,660
and keep your voice down.

578
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Walls have ears.

579
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,220
(Panyi, Yanzhou)
Enemy at the gates!

580
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,290
Alert!

581
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,130
Yes!

582
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,130
Wei rebels.

583
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,220
No matter the schemes,

584
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Panyi is now in my hands.

585
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,890
Fire arrows!

586
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,500
Young Master!

587
00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:02,460
Wei State!

588
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,940
Fire arrows!

589
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,570
Panyi is hard to attack.

590
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,050
Even if Wei Shao has the gods' power,

591
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,220
he won't make it.

592
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,090
Hold him up for two days.

593
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,940
When the sulfur is ready,

594
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,090
Wei will be doomed.

595
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,860
Attack!

596
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,410
My Lady,

597
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,020
let me bite it loose.

598
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,290
With your teeth?

599
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,260
How long will that take?

600
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,050
My Lady, what are you doing?

601
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,890
My Lady.

602
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
No, My Lady.

603
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,130
You'll hurt yourself.

604
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,530
Shh, the guards are outside.

605
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,500
Don't, My Lady, you'll get hurt.

606
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,530
Why suffer like this?

607
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,700
Seeing you like this,

608
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,610
I'm heartbroken.

609
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,420
Panyi is hard to attack.

610
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,780
If Wei Shao is held up for two days,

611
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,980
Liu Yan will have all the sulfur ready

612
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,420
and destroy the dam.

613
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,940
The water will flood Wei.

614
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,420
What about Wei's people?

615
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,050
If Wei Shao wants to take Panyi,

616
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,500
we must coordinate inside and out.

617
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,810
Have you forgotten
how Lord Wei treated you?

618
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,780
This is my fault.

619
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,810
I originally wanted

620
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,130
to fight fire with fire,

621
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,090
only to get burned myself.

622
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
I can't let the people die for nothing.

623
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,890
You don't even know where sulfur is.

624
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,050
That day,

625
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,460
I saw grain carts.

626
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,850
They probably carried sulfur.

627
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,780
I guess sulfur is in the granary.

628
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
You're safe here. Wait for me.

629
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,000
My Lady.

630
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,260
You can't act alone.

631
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,370
It's dangerous.

632
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,420
Come back!

633
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,810
Who's there?

634
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,460
How did you get in?

635
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,130
The granary is restricted.

636
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,980
You're not allowed here.

637
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,570
Who are you?

638
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,410
Halt!

639
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,820
What are you doing?

640
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,540
Halt!

641
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,690
Stop!

642
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,180
You search over there.

643
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,020
Yes.

644
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,740
Be careful.

645
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,690
Quick.

646
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
Quick, someone!

647
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,650
Be careful.

648
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,020
My Lord.

649
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,230
Though it's a feigned attack,

650
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,370
Panyi defenders fought like crazy.

651
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,220
Many common people joined them too.

652
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,090
Our casualties are heavy.

653
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,460
Liu Yan just arrived days ago.

654
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,050
Why do Panyi people trust him so?

655
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,180
It must be deception.

656
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,500
They must be bewitched

657
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,980
by Liu Yan and Lady Qiao.

658
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,740
That's why they take us as invaders.

659
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,530
Wheat.

660
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,940
Sulfur.

661
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,370
What happened?

662
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,940
My Lord, it's sulfur.

663
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,060
Sulfur smells strong.

664
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,180
It makes horses snort.

665
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,580
Sulfur?

666
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,100
Fire attack.

667
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,490
Fire attack!

668
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,140
It would harm civilians.

669
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,060
Liangya produces much sulfur.

670
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,330
Liu Yan plans a fire attack.

671
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,100
I expected Liu Yan to be despicable,

672
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,970
yet I never thought this vile.

673
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:34,970
Seems like there is

674
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,810
enough sulfur to burn down the city.

675
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,370
It's likely they'll ignite it all at once

676
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,620
when we enter the city.

677
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,010
If it succeeds,

678
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,010
Panyi will become hell instantly.

679
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,290
Liu Yan's cruelty

680
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,850
exceeds Li Su's back then.

681
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,450
This wretched guy.

682
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,260
Killing him would be letting him off easy.

683
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,370
My Lord, I'll order the soldiers

684
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,460
to halt the attack and wait

685
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,180
for opportunity.

686
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
Fire!

687
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,850
Quick, put out the fire!

688
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,690
Yes.

689
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,180
The granary is on fire.

690
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,180
Quick, someone!

691
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,140
- Fire!
- Put out the fire!

692
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,100
Put out the fire!

693
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,740
Quick, put out the fire!

694
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,660
The granary is on fire.

695
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,930
Come put out the fire!

696
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,330
Come put out the fire!

697
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,170
Quick!

698
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,260
The granary is on fire!

699
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,370
Quick, get water!

700
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,540
Put out the fire!

701
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,290
Report!

702
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,940
Panyi's granary is on fire.

703
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,850
It ignited the sulfur.

704
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,780
It's in chaos.

705
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,490
What?

706
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,890
It's in the granary.

707
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,740
Liu Yan reaps what he sows.

708
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,890
Liangya remnants are in chaos.

709
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,620
Heaven helps us.

710
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,180
Pass my order.

711
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,260
Full-scale attack!

712
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,470
Yes!

713
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,060
Avenge my lord's stolen wife!

714
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,210
Go.

715
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,420
Someone!

716
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,290
Where are they?

717
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,620
Young Master!

718
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,170
Young Master!

719
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,620
Soldiers can't handle it.

720
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,450
We must abandon the city.

721
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,260
No time to hesitate.

722
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,250
No.

723
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,700
I must find Xiaoqiao.

724
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,980
Young Master!

725
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,890
Personal guards!

726
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,140
Follow me!

727
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,290
Yes!

728
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,180
Capture Lady Qiao!

729
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,410
Kill her to boost morale!

730
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,930
Capture Lady Qiao!

731
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,410
Kill her to boost morale!

732
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,290
My Lord.

733
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,650
Where's Liu Yan?

734
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,650
Not found yet.

735
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,940
What about Lady Qiao?

736
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,330
Liangya remnants aren't caught.

737
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,490
No time to find her.

738
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,970
Liu Yan fled the city.

739
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,450
He might have taken Lady Qiao.

740
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,700
We must find Lady Qiao,

741
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,060
alive

742
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,100
or dead.

743
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,010
Yes!

744
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,100
Let's go!

745
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,130
Hya!

746
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,850
Hya!

747
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,780
This is Lady Qiao's place.

748
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,100
Search it carefully!

749
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,060
Yes!

750
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,450
General Wei Liang!

751
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,010
General Wei Liang!

752
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,850
General Wei Liang.

753
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,850
General Wei Liang.

754
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,140
- General.
- I'm looking for you.

755
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,100
Where's Lady Qiao?

756
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,620
She went to set fire.

757
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,740
Her hands were still injured.

758
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,970
Please help me find her.

759
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,890
Don't let Liu Yan catch her.

760
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,140
Do you mean

761
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,810
she started the fire?

762
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,770
Yes.

763
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,060
Wasn't she eloping with Liu Yan?

764
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,370
Why help our attack?

765
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,890
Not important. Please...

766
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,810
Greetings, Lord Wei.

767
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,700
Generals,

768
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,890
I'm Panyi Mayor Yang Feng.

769
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
Miss Xiaoqiao

770
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,260
was abducted

771
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,490
by Liu Yan.

772
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,740
She was held captive.

773
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,580
Even I couldn't see her.

774
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,540
The elopement rumor

775
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,010
is false.

776
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,620
Miss Xiaoqiao learned
Liu planned to use sulfur

777
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,740
to destroy the Yongning Canal

778
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,930
and flood Xindu.

779
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,700
So she sent me to stop it.

780
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,370
Destroy Yongning Canal

781
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,620
and flood Xindu?

782
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

783
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,810
Miss Xiaoqiao cares for Lord Wei,

784
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,930
so she started a fire

785
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,330
and created

786
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,100
an opportunity for your attack.

787
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,370
Do you mean

788
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,850
she was forced?

789
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,700
Yes.

790
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,410
Lord Wei, if you doubt it,

791
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,930
please look at these betrothal gifts.

792
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,660
What a mess!

793
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,740
She even received betrothal gifts.

794
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:12,850
What's this?

795
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,660
Betrothal beast.

796
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,220
They don't want to bother to hunt a lynx.

797
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,620
So they hunted a weasel instead.

798
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,540
Lord Wei,

799
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,970
please save Miss Xiaoqiao

800
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,260
before it's too late.

801
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,010
Liu Yan's men are seeking her.

802
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,740
So do our men.

803
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,370
Why do you seek her?

804
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,830
- For morale.
- Morale?

805
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,130
Go.

806
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,490
General Wei Xiao.

807
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,890
Liu Yan plans to destroy
the dam and flood Xindu.

808
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,900
What?

809
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,180
Do you think I came to save you?

810
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,890
At Xindu Battle,

811
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,930
if the Qiao family hadn't betrayed,

812
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,780
my father and brothers wouldn't have died

813
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,410
my mother

814
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,330
wouldn't have died of grief,

815
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,380
and I

816
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,370
wouldn't have become

817
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,060
a wild child fighting wolves for food.

818
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,290
So,

819
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,980
the Qiaos

820
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,740
all deserve death.
