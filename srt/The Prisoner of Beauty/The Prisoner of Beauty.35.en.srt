30
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,650
Out of fear that the truth
would come out,

31
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,140
Liu Yan ordered a siege.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,970
We couldn't hold them off.

33
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,940
General Wei Liang fought to
get me out of there,

34
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
but he...

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,340
He...

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,060
I...

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,000
It should've been me.

38
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,810
Qiao Ci,

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,180
look at me.

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,370
Wei Liang went to fetch you, right?

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,060
Where is he now?

42
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,810
Look at me.

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,660
Where is Wei Liang?

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,850
He went to Yujun.

45
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,940
Answer me. Where is he now?

46
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,460
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

47
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,250
Where is Wei Liang?

48
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,340
Where is he?

49
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,620
It should've been you.

50
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,920
Why did it have to be him?

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,060
Why not a Qiao?

52
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,900
Wei Xiao!

53
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,970
My Lord!

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,860
Reporting!

55
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,340
Liu Yan has taken Panyi with his troops.

56
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,740
Pass down my orders:

57
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,060
All troops, stay on alert.

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,940
Tomorrow,

59
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,850
we march on Panyi!

60
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,210
Yes.

61
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,370
My Lord.

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,060
My Lord, My Lord.

63
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,130
Let me lead a team to bring him back.

64
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,810
I asked Wei Liang to go. He'll be fine.

65
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,740
He just didn't see him.

66
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,940
- Wei Qu.
- I'll get him back.

67
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,970
Wei Qu, calm down!

68
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,810
Wei Qu!

69
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,850
Let me bring him back!

70
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,930
Get up.

71
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,210
Get up.

72
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,900
My Lord, let me bring him back.

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,740
Get up.

74
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,090
Wei Liang will be okay.

75
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,850
I'll go now. I'll bring him back!

76
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,850
Wei Qu, hear my command.

77
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,340
Tomorrow, take a cavalry unit

78
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,210
to Kangjun.

79
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,530
Find Qiao Ping.

80
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,460
Bring

81
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,340
Wei Liang back.

82
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,530
I will bring him back.

83
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,060
Yes, My Lord.

84
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,100
- My Lady.
- Manman. Manman.

85
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,940
- My Lady.
- Manman.

86
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,620
- Manman.
- My Lady.

87
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,530
Lie down.

88
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,740
My Lord.

89
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,290
Don't blame yourself.

90
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,340
I just hate

91
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,340
that I can't take this pain for you.

92
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,020
You grew up with Wei Liang.

93
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,530
You weren't real brothers,

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,490
but he was like a real brother to you.

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,050
Now, he was killed because of my family.

96
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,050
Even if we paid with our lives,

97
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,580
it wouldn't ease your pain.

98
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,700
I once promised you
that I'd give you more kids

99
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,610
and restore the past glory.

100
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,580
But now I've made you lose Wei Liang.

101
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,900
And Xiaotao...

102
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,410
She's still...

103
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,290
She's still waiting for Wei Liang.

104
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,090
This isn't your fault.

105
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,900
You've tried to balance both clans.

106
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,090
It's been exhausting.

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,290
Besides,

108
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,850
Qiao Yue and Liu Yan

109
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,930
did this.

110
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,530
You had nothing to do with it.

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,140
I will never blame you

112
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,930
for this.

113
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,340
But from now on,

114
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,780
I may...

115
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,660
I understand.

116
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,410
Whether it's to avenge Wei Liang,

117
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,140
take back Panyi for the people,

118
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,020
seek justice for General Wei Liang,

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,409
or punish my uncle's betrayal,

120
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,930
you must go to war at once.

121
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,780
Don't worry.

122
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,260
I don't blame you.

123
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,090
Thank you, Manman.

124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,170
You've never failed me,

125
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,490
and I will never fail you.

126
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,700
I promise.

127
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,020
This matter

128
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,090
will not implicate others.

129
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
I give you my word.

130
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
After I leave,

131
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,970
take care of this family for me.

132
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,700
Take care of yourself

133
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,220
and Feifei.

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,090
I may not be back

135
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,850
in time for Feifei's birth.

136
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,610
That's okay.

137
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,900
This time,

138
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,020
I won't see you off.

139
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,140
Be careful on your journey.

140
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,810
Don't worry.

141
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,300
(Yujun)

142
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,100
My Lord, don't worry.

143
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,159
Wei Xiao and I will protect Yujun.

144
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,210
We'll patrol day and night.

145
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,409
Nothing will happen.

146
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,140
Lady Xu and Lady Zhu
will take care of the Lady.

147
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,409
You have nothing to worry about.

148
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,820
Good.

149
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,780
- Depart!
- Yes!

150
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,740
Hyah!

151
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,530
My Lady, take care of yourself.

152
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,080
Don't strain yourself or harm the baby.

153
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,980
How's Xiaotao?

154
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,690
Xiaotao...

155
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,780
You're really going to Yanzhou?

156
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,500
I'll go and pick a real Yanzhou orchid

157
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,170
to marry you.

158
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,450
Are you asking me to serve you?

159
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,290
No need for that.

160
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,780
Just marry me.

161
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,410
Once I've saved enough wages,

162
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,340
I'll have the Lord ask

163
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,940
for your mother's approval on my behalf.

164
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,500
He values you.

165
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,810
He's afraid he's not worthy of you,

166
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,410
so he wants to do more.

167
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,170
Only then will he feel at ease.

168
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,500
You...

169
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,660
Come back safe, okay?

170
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,170
I've got your safety charm.

171
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,080
Even if I get injured,

172
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,140
I'll come back and ask
for your mother's approval.

173
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,100
Pah, pah, pah.

174
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,530
You won't get injured.

175
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,500
Mine is a little gold dart.

176
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,410
Every time we head to battle,

177
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,410
we leave these little weapons behind.

178
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,660
I want to give this to you.

179
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Seeing it

180
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,980
will be like seeing me.

181
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Before General Wei Liang died,

182
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,780
he asked me

183
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,690
to bring this orchid to you.

184
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,620
He must not have wanted you
to grieve like this.

185
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,890
He said

186
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,450
he'd bring the orchid

187
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,660
and propose to me.

188
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,210
Tell Xiaotao

189
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,380
not to wait for me!

190
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,170
This is from him.

191
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,380
My mother said

192
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,290
he was afraid I'd suffer

193
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,860
and I'd look down on him one day

194
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,210
so he made the betrothal gifts
so complex.

195
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,100
She asked me to let him.

196
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,330
She said it was more festive.

197
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,900
(Panyi City, Yanzhou)

198
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,530
Lord Yang.

199
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,050
What's the situation in the city?

200
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,540
The defenses are weak.

201
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,780
We can't hold against Liangya.

202
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,980
Panyi has completely fallen

203
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,100
into Liu Yan's hands.

204
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,080
Lord Yang,

205
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,050
we once helped Lord Qiao
knock at the gate.

206
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,690
So now...

207
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,560
Should we have

208
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,140
to turn to Liangya now?

209
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,380
Listen.

210
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,820
(Zhongzhou has defected)

211
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,170
Lady Yulou has swayed Zhongzhou,

212
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,210
dealing a major blow to Wei.

213
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,660
Now, Wei Shao's allies
are turning to me.

214
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
I wonder how he defies me now.

215
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,410
But the Wei cavalry is still strong.

216
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,410
Even without allies,
they're hard to defeat.

217
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,150
Last time at Panyi,

218
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,380
Liangya lost to them.

219
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,530
Things are different now.

220
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,450
Wei Shao must pass this way

221
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,050
(Yongning City)
to reach us.

222
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,210
Yongning City?

223
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,330
He once built a dam here

224
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,620
to divert floods.

225
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,160
If the upper course breaks
and the lower course is blocked,

226
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,740
what do you think will happen

227
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
when he passes through?

228
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,410
Brilliant.

229
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,170
If it works,

230
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,900
this place will become Wei Shao's grave.

231
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,690
That day,

232
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,170
Lady Qiao scared off my reinforcements.

233
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,780
Today, I shall return that disgrace

234
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,690
in full.

235
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,890
Who's there?

236
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,530
Come in.

237
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,930
I'm here to deliver a report.

238
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,900
The Wei army is on the move.

239
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,290
My Lords,

240
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,780
(Zhongzhou has defected)
what to do?

241
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,900
Just as expected.

242
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,170
Lord Yang, guard the Panyi dam.

243
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,810
Be ready to release the water.

244
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,780
Yes. I'll prepare to open the gate.

245
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,860
Not to open it.

246
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,780
Destroy it.

247
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,690
Destroy the dam?

248
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,570
That can't be.

249
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,100
I've observed the clouds.

250
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,570
Heavy rains are coming.

251
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,330
If we break the dam now,

252
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,450
the flood downstream
will be catastrophic.

253
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,740
If the rain intensifies,

254
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,860
the people will be doomed.

255
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,410
The Lord of Wei...

256
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,450
Wei Shao deserves it,
but the people along the way

257
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,210
are innocent.

258
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,410
To achieve greatness,
one can't fuss over trifles.

259
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,100
Lord Yang, my late father trusted you.

260
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,330
Surely you understand that.

261
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,530
You call this a trifle?

262
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,890
Fine.

263
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
I understand.

264
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,780
Governor, My Lord,

265
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,860
I'll do as you command.

266
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,860
But the dam of the Yongning Canal

267
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,140
is made of giant stones.

268
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,500
It's hard to destroy.

269
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,860
If we use sulfur as an explosive,

270
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,980
it must be placed

271
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,780
beneath the load-bearing wooden beams.

272
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,930
Without the right method,

273
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,380
it won't work.

274
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,290
My Lord,

275
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,060
he makes a point.

276
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,450
Then please wait here.

277
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,660
I'll fetch the engineering diagram.

278
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,819
With that, it'll be more effective.

279
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,170
Very well.

280
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,410
Be quick.

281
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,609
Yes.

282
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,010
The Yongning Canal project
is very complex,

283
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,490
especially the section
from Panyi to Xindu.

284
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,450
It took years to build.

285
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,490
Now,

286
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,490
it links two major rivers.

287
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,410
I can't even tell if we're standing

288
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,660
above the Yang River

289
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,170
or the Pei River.

290
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,730
Lord Yang,
you took Wei's salary for years.

291
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,840
Do you see yourself as from Yanzhou

292
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,250
or Wei?

293
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,770
Does it matter?

294
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,170
Lord Qiao devoted years to this dam

295
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,380
to unify the land.

296
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,140
He hoped

297
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,180
for good traffic and trade

298
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,820
so the people no longer needed
to travel long

299
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
for water, food, and minerals.

300
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,820
I've seen

301
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,410
that same ambition

302
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,620
not only in Lord Qiao

303
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,790
but in the Lord of Wei, too.

304
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,100
They say you built canals in Panyi

305
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,970
and even in Rongjun.

306
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,620
Panyi wasn't always

307
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,380
a water town.

308
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,250
It used to be a flood zone.

309
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,820
Thanks to Lord Qiao's water management,
it became what it is today.

310
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,100
I just followed him around,

311
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,170
digging trenches.

312
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,490
That's how I gained a little experience

313
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,860
to fight back against the floods
of the Young River.

314
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,540
That must've been hard.

315
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,730
When this is over,

316
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,900
you'll be rewarded.

317
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,010
I'm just

318
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,410
following orders.

319
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,930
There's no hardship in that.

320
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,690
But today,

321
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,340
I'll have to fail Lord Qiao.

322
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,300
Father built the canal for Yanzhou.

323
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,170
Destroying it now

324
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,100
is to eliminate a threat to Yanzhou.

325
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,970
You won't fail him.

326
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,100
Hurry and unroll the diagram.

327
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Let's get started.

328
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,740
Sure.

329
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,060
An assassin!

330
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,250
Someone help!

331
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,930
Don't move!

332
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,250
What are you doing?

333
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,450
I couldn't kill Liu Yan,

334
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,250
but I can kill you!

335
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,100
However,

336
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,580
I'll have to fail Lord Qiao.

337
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,410
Yang Feng, are you insane?

338
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,450
How can you live after killing me?

339
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,210
Without the dam

340
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,580
and Panyi,

341
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,410
what's the point

342
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,060
of surviving alone?

343
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,770
Let him go.

344
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,620
I'll spare your life.

345
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,170
If Zhen Zhi could die for the cause,

346
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,170
so can I.

347
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,520
My Lord,

348
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,660
don't push him.

349
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,290
Fine.

350
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,450
I'm sorry, Lord Qiao.

351
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,320
(Hydraulic Engineering Diagram)

352
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,380
You...

353
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,770
My Lord...

354
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,010
Even a minor mayor dared defy me?

355
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,900
Wei Shao,

356
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,250
I'll kill you myself.

357
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,180
(Hydraulic Engineering Diagram)

358
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,660
Don't worry too much

359
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,580
about Qiao and Liu.

360
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,340
It had nothing to do

361
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,820
with you or Ci.

362
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,300
Zhonglin will handle it.

363
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,340
Has your appetite

364
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,820
become better?

365
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,170
Yes.

366
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,490
My Lady.

367
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,770
My Lady.

368
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,380
My Lady.

369
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,730
General Wei Xiao requests an audience.

370
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,820
Let him in.

371
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,660
Yes.

372
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,730
My Ladies,

373
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,770
news from the border.

374
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,640
Su Ehuang and Xue Tai

375
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,860
are leading the Zhongzhou army

376
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,700
to attack Yujun.

377
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,450
Zhongzhou has defected too?

378
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,010
How many troops are in Yujun now?

379
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
My Lady,

380
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,250
our troops

381
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,170
are fewer than 60,000.

382
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,970
Besides the border garrisons,

383
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,690
the Lord also left 5,000 each

384
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,900
in Yunzhong and Rongjun.

385
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,660
Grandmother,

386
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,660
I believe we should dispatch couriers

387
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,280
to warn the Lord,

388
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,580
so he'll be more careful.

389
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,890
They can also alert the border generals

390
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,210
to support one another

391
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,970
in case they're attacked.

392
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,080
Approved.

393
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,410
Let's do as you suggest.

394
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,490
Though the enemy comes strong,

395
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,110
the men of the Wei Clan

396
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,330
are battle-tested.

397
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,970
Heaven favors Wei.

398
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,380
We will overcome this.

399
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,410
General, please wait.

401
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
Grandmother,

402
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,730
Yujun is in grave danger.

403
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,410
We should post a notice
to call on the people

404
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,170
to defend Yujun with us.

405
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,300
Anyone who volunteers

406
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,170
can get armor and weapons in the office.

407
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,580
Also, we should open the gates

408
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,970
for two days

409
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,210
to let those who wish to go

410
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,820
leave Yujun.

411
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,540
When peace returns,

412
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,690
they can come back.

413
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,050
The Wei Clan

414
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,770
always puts the people first.

415
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,810
Do as you say.

416
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,860
- General Wei Xiao.
- Yes.

417
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,100
Escort Lady Zhu and the Lady

418
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,690
out of the city.

419
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,970
- Be quick.
- Yes.

420
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,810
Grandmother,

421
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,580
I can't leave.

422
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,380
I must stay in Yujun.

423
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,170
Before the Lord left,

424
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,410
I promised him

425
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,460
that...

426
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,450
- Lady Qiao.
- She's about to give birth.

427
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,300
Summon the physician!

428
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,410
Hurry!

429
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,930
Breathe. Breathe.

430
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,810
Hurry!

431
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,450
My Lady, please wait outside.

432
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,660
My Lady.

433
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,060
My Lady, push!

434
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,010
Come on, wipe her sweat.

435
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,380
Don't panic, My Lady.

436
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,450
Just relax.

437
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,450
Inhale. Push.

438
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,010
My Lady.

439
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,450
Don't panic. Hurry.

440
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,540
Relax.

441
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,010
Whoa.

442
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,050
Watch out!

443
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,610
Watch out!

444
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,380
- Inhale.
- Inhale.

445
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,500
Exhale.

446
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,250
Not yet.

447
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,140
Push again.

448
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,980
Exhale.

449
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,140
- Push!
- Push!

450
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,930
Push!

451
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,970
Push, My Lady!

452
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,930
Push!

453
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
Bear with it.

454
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,410
Come on, one, two.

455
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,820
Push!

456
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,300
Hurry!

457
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,490
Lift!

458
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,520
We can see the head.

459
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,540
We can see the head.

460
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,380
Push!

461
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,900
The baby is here!

462
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,070
The baby is here!

463
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,010
The baby is here!

464
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,690
- The baby is here.
- It's born.

465
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,930
Alright.

466
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,690
Congratulations, My Lady.

467
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,930
You have a child now.

468
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,420
My Lady,

469
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,580
look.

470
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,540
It's a little girl.

471
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,300
Feifei.

472
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,970
This is wonderful.

473
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,010
Wonderful.

474
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,210
Both of you are safe.

475
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,060
Mother.

476
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,930
Thank you.

477
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,450
She looks adorable.

478
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,290
How are you?

479
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,450
It must've been so hard.

480
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,660
Not at all.

481
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,690
You're soaked in sweat.

482
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,690
Report!

483
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,140
Yunzhong, Rongjun,
and Hanjun have fallen.

484
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,010
A force of 100,000 is marching on Yujun.

485
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,250
What do we do?

486
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,150
My Lady!

487
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,240
- What to do?
- Pack now.

488
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,690
Let's bring the Lady back to Yanzhou.

489
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,210
- What should we do?
- What to do?

490
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,050
Where do we go?

491
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,450
- What should we do?
- What to do?

492
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,310
Where can we go?

493
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,210
Stop panicking.

494
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,100
Grandmother,

495
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,540
the Lord left 60,000 men here.

496
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,100
How many troops does he have?

497
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,660
Building the Yongning Canal

498
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,900
cost Wei dearly.

499
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,010
We don't have many left.

500
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,380
How is he

501
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
supposed to fight?

502
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,250
What to do?

503
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,860
Good child.

504
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,100
Since Zhonglin has arranged it,

505
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,270
he must have a plan to win.

506
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,250
Get some rest.

507
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,820
I'll arrange for guards

508
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,250
to escort you

509
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,170
and Lady Zhu out.

510
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,660
I can't leave.

511
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,660
Grandmother.

512
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,620
Before the Lord left,

513
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,620
I promised him

514
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,100
to take care of everything at home

515
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,300
with no mistakes.

516
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,690
Grandmother, you are my family.

517
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,580
Yujun is my home.

518
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,820
I am the Lady of Wei.

519
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,930
I will stand with the people of Yujun.

520
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,410
I won't leave either.

521
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,010
Stop making more trouble.

522
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,770
In my whole life,

523
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
I've only wanted

524
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,860
to make you happy,

525
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,580
but I'm foolish

526
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,970
and often fail.

527
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,060
If you can see me differently

528
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,410
when I choose to stay,

529
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,250
then I won't leave.

530
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,250
Yes.

531
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,540
Though I'm

532
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,410
afraid of death,

533
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,970
my sons

534
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,690
and my husband

535
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,210
would never be deserters.

536
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,660
I will never

537
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,930
shame them

538
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,540
because of me.

539
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,530
Mother,

540
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,250
please let me stay.

541
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,820
I beg you.

542
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,850
Look.

543
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,660
These are

544
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,340
the Ladies of Wei.

545
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,060
She's smiling.

546
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,860
My Lord,

547
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,060
just as expected,

548
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,490
Liu Yan took Panyi

549
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,560
and destroyed the dam.

550
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,490
The Yang River broke free,
flooding everything.

551
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,300
He wants to trap us here

552
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,490
to miss our chance.

553
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,170
Anything else?

554
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,250
The couriers report

555
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,380
that Lord Zhen and Lord Yang
died for the cause.

556
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,620
Qiao Yue is dead.

557
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,140
How many of our men are left?

558
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,380
Fewer than 70%.

559
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,420
(Yujun)

560
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,770
(Panyi)

561
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,140
We can't delay anymore.

562
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,250
We must hurry to Panyi

563
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,590
and retake the Yongning Canal.

564
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,010
Report!

565
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,380
My Lord,

566
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,020
Lady Yulou and General Xue Tai

567
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,820
are leading 100,000 troops
to besiege Yujun.

568
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,270
They'll break through the gates soon.

569
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,580
Please come back to defend.

570
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,140
My Lord,

571
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,340
Lady Xu, Lady Zhu, and the Lady

572
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,660
are still in Yujun.

573
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,170
If the enemy breaches the city,

574
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,380
their lives will be at risk.

575
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,620
Fifteen years ago in Xindu,

576
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,380
the Wei Clan lost three generations.

577
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Must we face

578
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,170
the same today?

579
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,330
My Lord,

580
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,010
shall we march on Panyi

581
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,170
or fall back to defend Yujun?

582
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,900
Grandfather wants to keep
the people of Yanzhou

583
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,540
out of this war.

584
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,410
Whether to fail one person

585
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,140
or fail the people...

586
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,140
If it were me,
I wouldn't know how to choose either.

587
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,780
(Panyi)

588
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,610
Pass on my orders:

589
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,250
Let's march on Panyi

590
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,240
and retake the Yongning Canal.

591
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes.

592
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,450
(Government Office)
Those seeking shelter

593
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,690
with nowhere else to go,

594
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,820
regardless of age,

595
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,100
may take refuge in the hall.

596
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,580
My Lady,

597
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,250
I want to enlist.

598
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,140
The enemy

599
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,010
is at our doorstep.

600
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,970
Though I am a woman,

601
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,660
I refuse to be bullied.

602
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,340
- I want to protect my home.
- Yes.

603
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,820
I once followed the late lord

604
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,250
to fight across the land.

605
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,410
Now the enemy's children
have reached our homes.

606
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,290
Yes.

607
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,450
We must show them

608
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,930
the power of Wei.

609
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,210
- Yes.
- Drive the enemy away!

610
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,190
Defend Wei!

611
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,380
Drive the enemy away! Defend Wei!

612
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,690
I know you want to protect our home.

613
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,780
Thank you all.

614
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,660
Count us in.

615
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,100
Count us in.

616
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,860
We may fail

617
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,580
in the battle today.

618
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,300
But we stand here

619
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,900
to tell everyone

620
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,410
the Wei Clan
hasn't betrayed the Wei State

621
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,580
and never will.

622
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,980
Yes.

623
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,540
As long as the Wei Clan stands,

624
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,170
the Wei State stands.

625
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,740
As long as the Wei Clan stands,

626
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,900
the Wei State stands.

627
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,450
The Wei Clan

628
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,540
will stand with you.

629
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,730
Defend Yujun!

630
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,380
Protect the Wei State!

631
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:35,690
Defend Yujun! Protect the Wei State!

632
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,900
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

633
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,300
Cheers! Come on!

634
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,250
We're on duty. Drink less.

635
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,890
What's there to fear?

636
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,730
The battle is at Panyi.

637
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,980
Who'd come here?

638
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,770
Cheers!

639
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,050
Come on!

640
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,260
If you go to Kangjun,

641
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,050
you can bring back
the Lord's father-in-law

642
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,050
and pick up an orchid on the way.

643
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,810
Then you can marry Xiaotao
when you're back.

644
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,100
Come on.

645
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,690
Let me fill your bowl.

646
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,770
Your face wasn't harmed.

647
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,810
We're not staying here.

648
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,250
I'm here to get you, Liang.

649
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,290
I'm bringing you home.

650
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,060
Aren't you Wei's greatest warrior?

651
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,580
Why did you die here?

652
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,170
How could you die here?

653
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,210
Come on, come with me.

654
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,770
I won't draw
grass straws anymore, Liang.

655
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,540
I won't.

656
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,290
Get up. Come home with me.

657
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,660
Get up!

658
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,580
Get up. I can't carry you.

659
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,140
We won't draw grass straws anymore.

660
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,770
Xiaotao's waiting to marry you.

661
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,540
Liang, let's go home.

662
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,500
Let's go.

663
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,690
You must be cold.

664
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,530
Liang,

665
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,690
we're not staying here.

666
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,370
I'll bring you home.

667
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,620
(Kangjun Wharf)

668
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:09,060
(Wei)

669
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,300
(Wei)

670
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,140
The Wei Clan

671
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,140
still has to fight for the Qiao Clan.

672
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,770
The Lord sent me to rescue a Qiao.

673
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,580
Come with me.

674
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,730
Enemy! Reinforce the defense!

675
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,570
Yes.

676
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,690
Liang.

677
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,890
Liang.

678
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,770
I lost an arm.

679
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,850
Go to Kangjun

680
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,170
and bring

681
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,530
Wei Liang back.

682
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,690
Who's there?

683
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,620
Wei Qu, General of Wei.

684
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,850
I'm here to rescue you.

685
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,370
Thanks, General Wei.

686
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,020
Can you see anything?

687
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,890
Though I can't see,

688
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,580
I still have some basic fighting skills.

689
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,770
I won't hold you back.

690
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,850
Just give me

691
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,100
some instructions, General.

692
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,210
Hold on to me tight.

693
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,980
General,

694
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,140
who's on your back?

695
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,500
Wei Liang, General of Wei.

696
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,250
You two,

697
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,940
I suggest you surrender.

698
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,140
This is Yanzhou.

699
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,770
How can a Liangya man be in charge?

700
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,500
Soldiers, you might not know,

701
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,690
but your governor

702
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,890
was killed in Panyi
by the Lord of Liangya.

703
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,370
Liangya is hiding this

704
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,100
to divide Yanzhou later.

705
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,580
My brother is dead?

706
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,370
Qiao Yue is dead.

707
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,100
So, the prefect is

708
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,170
the governor now.

709
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,330
Are you sure

710
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,500
you want to fight him now?

711
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Don't listen to him.

712
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,940
Seize these two immediately.

713
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,660
The Lord of Liangya
offers a heavy reward.

714
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,220
The Wei army will soon crush Panyi.

715
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,160
The Lord of Liangya
can barely protect himself,

716
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,020
let alone you.

717
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,770
- Well.
- Think carefully.

718
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,020
Will you listen to a Liangya man

719
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,980
or your prefect?
