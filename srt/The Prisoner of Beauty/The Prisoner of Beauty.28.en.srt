My Lord.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,940
Yan.

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,770
Zhonglin, you're here.

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,380
You can tell everyone

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,380
why I'm protecting these spies,

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,180
why Bianzhou wants me as a hostage,

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,180
and whether I belong to Wei or Bianzhou.

38
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,610
Release them.

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

40
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,220
Wherever you belong,

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,730
you are always my cousin.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,260
But in this world,

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,690
a cousin should never
love his cousin-in-law.

44
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,850
This isn't the time for that.

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,890
I'll find out who started the rumor

46
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,940
and I will clear your name.

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,450
Then, I'll tell everyone

48
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,410
I'm the son of Chen Pang from Bianzhou.

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,660
What?

50
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,410
I'm Shiyuan of the Chen Clan.

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,570
From this day forth,

52
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,010
I'm no longer your cousin Shiyuan,
Lord of Wei.

53
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,220
After more than twenty years of brotherhood,

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,380
I ask but one thing.

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,410
Let me go.

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,850
Yan...

57
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,690
Lord of Wei.

58
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,940
Today, I'll leave

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,780
Yujun,

60
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,890
and return to Bianzhou.

61
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,220
No need to see me off.

62
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,420
(Yujun)

63
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,780
(Yujun)

64
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,500
(Yujun)

65
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,420
Hyah!

66
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Hyah!

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,940
Yan!

68
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,460
Whoa.

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,740
Yan.

70
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,660
My mind is set.

71
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,340
Zhonglin, don't try to stop me.

72
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,410
Please trust me,

73
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,540
I'll find out

74
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,810
who started the rumor.

75
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,700
Even if you do, so what?

76
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,810
Some will never believe the truth.

77
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,730
Only by taking all the blame myself

78
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,900
can you and Lady Qiao remain honorable.

79
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,490
You're my family.

80
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,780
You don't have to take the blame.

81
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,100
But what if I want to

82
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,370
return to my other family?

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
Don't say that to me.

84
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,660
Say it to Grandmother.

85
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,610
Are you afraid that

86
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,660
if I'll go back to Chen's

87
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,540
I'll stand against you?

88
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,900
Is that why you refuse to let me go?

89
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,850
Wei State fears no such thing.

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,900
Zhonglin,

91
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,340
I beg you,

92
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,020
let me walk my own path.

93
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,730
I've served the Wei family

94
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,900
for over twenty years.

95
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,730
I have ambitions.

96
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,540
Now, the chance lies before me,

97
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,020
I must seize it.

98
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,020
You truly believe

99
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,350
that once you return,

100
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,100
you'll get everything you desire,

101
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,290
and you'll rule a region?

102
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,340
If I succeed,

103
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
it is my fortune.

104
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,410
If I fail, it is my fate.

105
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,900
Even if I die,

106
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,700
I'll have no regrets.

107
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,890
Yan!

108
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,050
I swear,

109
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,810
so long as Lady Xu draws breath,

110
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,730
I shall never raise a hand with Bianzhou

111
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,140
to invade the Wei State.

112
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,100
I swear on my severed finger.

113
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,900
This wine is called

114
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
"Yearning for Home".

115
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,930
I planned to take it with me.

116
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,340
But now,

117
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,170
my life is like driftwood.

118
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,610
What home do I have?

119
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,370
Let this be

120
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,780
our farewell wine, Cousin.

121
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,170
Don't cry!

122
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,760

How did she suddenly hit her head?

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,580
Last night,
Mr. Wei came to say his farewells.

136
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Farewells?

137
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,970
My Lady, the city has been restless lately.

138
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,140
But how could Grandmother allow him to leave?

139
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,930
She couldn't stop him.

140
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,540
Think of something.

141
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
We have to cheer up Grandmother.

142
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,850
It won't be easy.

143
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,700
Since last night,

144
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,810
she has been not well.

145
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,100
Not well?

146
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,290
How is she not well?

147
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,730
Where was she hurt?

148
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,220
She... She hit her head.

149
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,570
Head?

150
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,250
Mother. Mother...

151
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,780
That's really bad!

152
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,370
- Ma'am, slow down.
- Mother...

153
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,250
When have you ever taken to bed, Mother?

154
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,900
Mother!

155
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,980
Why are you not well?

156
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,810
How could just a bump to the head
make you like this?

157
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,460
- Mother?
- Am I too late?

158
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,220
Quick.

159
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,100
Go to my chambers.

160
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Bring me that important item.

161
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,530
What item?

162
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,130
The gold-jade burial suit!

163
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,610
Grandmother is only in low spirits.

164
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,730
Low spirits, is it?

165
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,330
Mother,

166
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
what would you like to eat or drink?

167
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,180
I'll have it prepared at once.

168
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,340
Sorry to trouble you.

169
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,650
It was just

170
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,770
a bump on my head.

171
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,700
You even went so far as to prepare a coffin?

172
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,580
I...

173
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,700
You've long been waiting

174
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,650
for this day, haven't you?

175
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,780
No...

176
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,130
I misunderstood the servants' words.

177
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,610
They said you hit your head.

178
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,850
I thought something terrible had happened,

179
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,340
and... I was so panicked
I didn't know what I was saying.

180
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,700
Please don't take offense, Mother.

181
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,490
That item is complicated to prepare,

182
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,300
so I had it readied in advance...

183
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,250
for myself, actually.

184
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,220
Mother, you won't be needing it.

185
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,370
Fine.

186
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,180
You're filial.

187
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,130
Mother, please keep Grandmother company.

188
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,890
I'll take my leave.

189
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,900
Alright, alright.

190
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,610
You may all leave as well.

191
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,010
Mother, please rest well.

192
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,130
Ma'am, let's go.

193
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,220
I've calmed Grandmother down.

194
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
In the end,

195
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,890
I couldn't make him stay.

196
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
I wonder

197
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,530
do the ones I care about

198
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,060
always end up leaving me?

199
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,530
I understand.

200
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,980
I've been away from home too,

201
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,340
and my heart aches with longing.

202
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,130
But you still have me,

203
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,420
Grandmother,

204
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,890
and Mother.

205
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,010
We are all your family.

206
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,300
We'll always stay by your side.

207
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,610
Rumor has been swirling,

208
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,580
forcing Mr. Wei to leave.

209
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,370
Grandmother fell gravely ill.

210
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,700
It feels like

211
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,180
someone's pulling all the strings.

212
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,490
But don't worry, My Lord.

213
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,530
We will find the one behind all this

214
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,530
and restore Wei's honor.

215
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,260
Good.

216
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,020
(Yujun, Wei State)

217
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,580
Lord of Wei summoned you all of a sudden.

218
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,300
Did he find something out?

219
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,980
Zixin hasn't returned from

220
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,010
dealing with Lan?

221
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,580
I've come this far,

222
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,180
no turning back now.

223
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,370
I'd rather risk it all

224
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,530
than fall short.

225
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,010
What Lady Qiao has,

226
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,300
I can have as well.

227
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,460
(Peace and Prosperity)

228
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,460
Lord of Wei, you summoned me.

229
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,100
Is there something I can help with?

230
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,650
There's an old case still unsolved.

231
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,530
I'd like your opinion.

232
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,850
Do you know this woman?

233
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,130
She looks

234
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,980
a bit like Lady Qiao.

235
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,730
Oh, right.

236
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,530
I heard a rumor a few days ago.

237
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,970
Perhaps

238
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,300
it's connected to her.

239
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,490
Nothing else?

240
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,130
Zhonglin,

241
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,890
I don't know what you mean.

242
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,850
She's confessed.

243
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,890
She said you asked her

244
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,580
to bring me to the painting.

245
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,730
And then you spread rumor

246
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,130
about my cousin and my wife.

247
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,850
You'd believe her over me?

248
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
What do you think?

249
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,610
That's right.

250
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,770
I was the one behind it.

251
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,610
But everything I did was for the Wei Clan.

252
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,650
Yanzhou sent a beauty,

253
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,610
using Lady Qiao to divide you and Shiyuan.

254
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,940
How could you accept that?

255
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,180
Wei Liang.

256
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,020
Zixin...

257
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,330
Zixin.

258
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,730
At first, he refused to speak.

259
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,650
I had him whipped ten lashes.

260
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,730
Then he admitted to switching the wheat seeds

261
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,250
at Grandmother's birthday banquet.

262
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,610
I gave him ten more lashes.

263
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,730
He admitted to framing Qiao Ci.

264
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,730
With another ten lashes,

265
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,340
he admitted the rumor

266
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,340
involving my cousin and my wife

267
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,100
was entirely his doing.

268
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,490
Thinking of Yan's pain from

269
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,820
losing his finger,

270
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,460
I cut off his as payback.

271
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,140
Zixin?

272
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,650
- Zixin.
- It wasn't me.

273
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,180
Zixin.

274
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,890
It was her. She's behind it all.

275
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,900
She did everything.

276
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,900
She came here

277
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,100
to marry the Lord of Wei.

278
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,420
To marry Lord of Wei,

279
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,340
she'd do anything.

280
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Anything!

281
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,010
She's behind it all.

282
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,890
Drag these two out.

283
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
Execute them at once.

284
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,180
Yes.

285
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,180
Lord of Wei, spare me.

286
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,610
Lord of Wei, spare me.

287
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,700
- Ehuang!
- Lord of Wei.

288
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,890
- Ehuang, save me!
- I don't want to die.

289
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,340
- Ehuang!
- Lord of Wei!

290
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,300
- It wasn't me.
- Please spare me!

291
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,980
- Ehuang! Ehuang!
- Lord of Wei, have mercy!

292
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,980
Don't take my life!

293
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,770
Lord of Wei!

294
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,420
Zhonglin,

295
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,610
I've always acted for you,

296
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,610
and for the Wei Clan.

297
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,250
My conscience is clear.

298
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,340
A clear conscience, you say?

299
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,220
During the wheat seed incident,

300
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,060
I was still the Lady of Bianzhou.

301
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,160
Every move I made

302
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,770
was under Chen Xiang's control.

303
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,370
He feared the Qiao-Wei alliance,

304
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,300
and worried that the canal construction

305
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,180
would threaten Bianzhou.

306
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,610
So he ordered me
to come here and sow discord.

307
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,850
We were on opposite sides.

308
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,580
I had no other choice.

309
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,820
Her Ladyship and I stood on opposite sides,

310
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,380
but she never stooped

311
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,530
as low as you did.

312
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,700
How can I compare to Lady Qiao?

313
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,570
She was born in Yanzhou.

314
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,730
Her family has loved her since birth.

315
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,180
The people support her.

316
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,410
But for me?

317
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,460
I've been a pawn of the Su Clan since birth,

318
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,180
cast aside by my own family.

319
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,700
My life is adrift.

320
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,770
My suffering...

321
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,180
My suffering is far worse

322
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,660
than Lady Qiao's!

323
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,900
It is your own delusions that have

324
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,810
brought you to this wretched state.

325
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,220
If you'd returned to Wushan earlier,

326
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,660
you wouldn't have fallen into my hands.

327
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,490
My delusions?

328
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,380
If I had Lady Qiao's good fortune

329
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,010
of having a man who truly cherishes her,

330
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,660
why would I be plagued by such delusions?

331
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,490
Why me?

332
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,250
Why am I the one marked with the peony?

333
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,660
Why must I be separated from Bogong forever?

334
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,490
Why did I marry Chen Xiang

335
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,050
but not grow old with him?

336
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,730
Am I the one with delusions?

337
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,980
All I ever wanted was
to find a place where I belong!

338
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,570
Zhonglin,

339
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,660
remember how I lived

340
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,980
in your home as a child?

341
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,460
We were meant to be family.

342
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,250
It was the Qiao Clan who betrayed us.

343
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,730
If not for them,

344
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,140
Bogong would still be alive!

345
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,420
The Qiaos caused Bogong's death!

346
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,250
- Enough!
- They ruined everything!

347
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,530
How dare you speak Brother's name?

348
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,620
You say no one ever cared about you,

349
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,180
but Brother loved you

350
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,290
and cherished you.

351
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,570
Even as he lay dying,

352
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,380
he entrusted me to look after you.

353
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Chen Xiang

354
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,490
treated you well.

355
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,810
He built you that pavilion

356
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,860
and indulged your schemes for Wushan.

357
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,290
But you ignored

358
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,490
all their kindness.

359
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,220
Instead of blaming the so-called unfairness,

360
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,010
why not ask yourself why you never saw

361
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,490
the love and care around you?

362
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,380
No.

363
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,980
That's not true. I didn't...

364
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,460
I don't want your excuses.

365
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,740
Now,

366
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,570
you've harmed Wei's interests

367
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,490
and the ones I love.

368
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,140
So you deserve...

369
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,660
My Lord, she's a spy from a foreign state!

370
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,730
She deserves execution!

371
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,380
Zhonglin,

372
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
you can't kill me.

373
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,460
I can help you rule the realm.

374
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,530
Zhonglin, look at me.

375
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,770
I have the peony mark.

376
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,490
It's a symbol of fortune.

377
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,420
You can use me to win

378
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,380
the people's hearts

379
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,290
and command all the powers.

380
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,500
Zhonglin.

381
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,610
Zhonglin...

382
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,090
An empress's fate?

383
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,930
Yes,

384
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,050
an empress's fate.

385
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,980
My family doesn't need that.

386
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,860
And Brother knew long ago

387
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,290
that your huadian is fake.

388
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,490
But he still cherished you

389
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,620
and wanted to marry you.

390
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,740
What a pity.

391
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,650
You don't deserve it.

392
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,660
For the sake of my brother,

393
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,010
I'll spare your life.

394
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,700
You all knew it long ago...

395
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,660
By military law, she shall be branded

396
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,730
with the slit nose.

397
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,570
Yes!

398
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,780
Wei Shao.

399
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,250
Kill me. Just kill me.

400
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,860
Kill me now!

401
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,090
But as long as I live,

402
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,530
I'll drag you and Lady Qiao to hell!

403
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,700
You think that Lady Qiao truly loves you?

404
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,940
Every woman's love for a man

405
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,290
is always a game of calculation.

406
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,460
They want either your heart or your power.

407
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,490
But in her heart, what matters most

408
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,220
will always be the Qiao Clan.

409
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,010
I'm waiting for the day she turns on you.

410
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,370
Carry it out.

411
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,610
Wei Shao!

412
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,730
Just you wait.

413
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,090
I'll drag you and Lady Qiao to hell!

414
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,260
(Wei)

415
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,860
(Spirit Tablet of Wei Bao, My Late Brother)

416
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,420
Are you feeling regret for Brother, My Lord?

417
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,180
Yes.

418
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,250
She let down Brother's deep love.

419
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,220
Was the Su Ehuang Brother loved

420
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,090
the same one as now?

421
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,090
Of course not.

422
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,290
Now she's done many wicked deeds

423
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,700
and betrayed Brother's sincerity
and kindness.

424
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,700
And to save herself,

425
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,940
she even shamelessly claimed

426
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,330
she admired me.

427
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,570
Shameless.

428
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,250
I believe the Su Ehuang Brother loved

429
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,250
was pure and kind-hearted.

430
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,090
At least back then, she didn't betray him.

431
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Besides,

432
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,010
even if she says she admires you now,

433
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,700
it might not be a lie.

434
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,290
What nonsense are you talking about?

435
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,570
Now, Wei Shao rules the Wei State,

436
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,570
commands millions of soldiers,

437
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,080
reclaimed Xindu,

438
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,010
built the Yongning Canal, and governs

439
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,290
the waterways across the realm.

440
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,220
Su Ehuang admires those in power.

441
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,250
It's no surprise she's taken

442
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,420
a liking to Wei Shao.

443
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,730
You're quite casual calling me

444
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,700
by name, aren't you?

445
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,570
What I want to say is

446
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,290
that people can change.

447
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,180
She's been through hardship

448
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,660
and it shaped who she is now.

449
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,090
So you needn't feel regret for Brother.

450
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,140
At least returning the jade to him

451
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,980
is a good thing.

452
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,330
Yes.

453
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,490
People do change.

454
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,260
What about you?

455
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,900
Will your feelings for me change

456
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,650
one day?

457
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,730
Of course not.

458
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,290
Because I already have

459
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,810
a husband who truly loves me.

460
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,900
What's wrong?

461
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,900
I just saw Lady Yulou's face.

462
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,490
It was horrifying.

463
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,490
We should run while we still can.

464
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,570
Lady Yulou is disfigured.

465
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,900
What noble house would still marry her?

466
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,290
If we keep serving her,

467
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,140
we'll have no future.

468
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,140
She shouldn't have crossed Lord of Wei.

469
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,420
Even that empress's fate is fake.

470
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,290
What should we do now?

471
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,540
Calm down.

472
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,010
Let's find a chance

473
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,900
to take her valuables and leave.

474
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,660
A daughter? Again?

475
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,250
How could she bear the future
of the Su Clan from Wushan?

476
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,900
Find her a good husband in the future.

477
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,730
Your huadian almost washed off in the rain.

478
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,980
Be careful.

479
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,900
Without that huadian,

480
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,330
you're nothing!

481
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,330
Once in the Wei family,

482
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,490
you must get along with both young masters.

483
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,940
The future of the Su Clan depends on you.

484
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,700
Chen Xiang, Governor of Bianzhou, is frail.

485
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,770
He needs the blessing of your empress's fate.

486
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,700
Be cautious in your conduct.

487
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,420
Now, we rely on you

488
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,660
to revive the Su Clan.

489
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,220
Lady Yulou is no longer Lady of Bianzhou.

490
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,380
Stay indoors and avoid

491
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,940
bringing trouble to the Su Clan.

492
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,180
But Brother loved you

493
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,290
and cherished you.

494
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,290
Even as he lay dying,

495
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,980
he entrusted me to look after you.

496
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,900
Chen Xiang treated you well.

497
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,090
He built you that pavilion

498
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,980
and indulged your schemes for Wushan.

499
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,090
But you ignored

500
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,090
all their kindness.

501
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,900
You love yourself the most.

502
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,380
Kill me now!

503
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,570
But as long as I live,

504
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,860
I'll drag you and Lady Qiao to hell!

505
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,900
Lady Yulou is disfigured.

506
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,880
What noble house

507
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,530
would still marry her?

508
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,140
If we keep serving her,

509
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,140
we'll have no future.

510
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,900
I'll go take her valuables now.

511
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,250
Let's escape together.

512
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,090
Alright.

513
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,650
Here.

514
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,380
Take it. Hurry up.

515
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,860
Let's go.

516
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,730
What's this?

517
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,940
This is worth a lot.

518
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,660
Quick, hurry up.

519
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,810
Lady Yulou.

520
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
Lady Yulou.

521
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,700
Lady Yulou.

522
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,090
You're leaving me too?

523
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,050
You think I've lost my worth

524
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,140
and want to discard me like trash?

525
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,380
Have mercy, Lady Yulou.

526
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,810
Please have mercy, Lady Yulou.

527
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,090
I was born with an empress's fate,

528
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,860
too noble for mere mortals to bear.

529
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,180
Only a golden mask can conceal it.

530
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,490
You chosen to serve me

531
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,420
and I will repay

532
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,250
your loyalty.

533
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,980
Lady Yulou.

534
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,010
Remember,

535
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,090
it's not that I must marry
the ruler of the realm.

536
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,330
It's that whoever marries me

537
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,860
will become the ruler of the realm.

538
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,900
At your command, Lady Yulou.

539
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,180
Send out my command.

540
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,900
(Xue Tai, Juejun)
Summon General Xue Tai.

541
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,810
Let's go

542
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,330
to Liangya.

543
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,220
There seem to be many documents today.

544
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,330
Guess His Lordship will work late.

545
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,730
Her Lordship is diligent as ever.

546
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,420
If I do it, my head will explode.

547
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,050
If you don't, yours might anyway.

548
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,620
Someone, come in.

549
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,980
Yes, My Lord?

550
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,250
My neck feels stiff.

551
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,180
I'll fetch the physician.

552
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,460
No need.

553
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,180
Come, tend to my neck.

554
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,770
Over here, come on.

555
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,020
Here.

556
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,170
Alright, stop.

557
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,940
Are you trying to kill me?

558
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,570
Sorry, but I don't know how.

559
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,530
That makes sense.

560
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,220
You're not married yet,

561
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,770
no one by your side to look after you.

562
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,500
It's not your fault.

563
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,930
Alright, you may leave now.

564
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm leaving.

565
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
My Lord, do you want to ask

566
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,140
about the canal construction?

567
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,290
Troops have been sent out.

568
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,250
They'll arrive soon.

569
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,180
Good. I trust you with this task.

570
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,250
Got any pastries?

571
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,220
I'll check the kitchen.

572
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,130
No need.

573
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,810
Just give me what you usually eat.

574
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,460
Dried Meat.

575
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,570
Here, try some.

576
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Curb your hunger.

577
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,730
You can't eat this forever.

578
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,460
Didn't you use to eat this all the time?

579
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,420
I did.

580
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,220
But I don't eat this anymore now.

581
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,620
You know

582
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,010
why you could handle

583
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,940
such a rough life?

584
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,140
Because you weren't married.

585
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,420
Back then, you'd finish a whole pack.

586
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,060
You can go now.

587
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,310
Want more?

588
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,700
No. Get out.

589
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,860
My Lord, Wei Qu said you might be cold

590
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,050
and asked me to bring you a coat.

591
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,130
Alright.

592
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,770
You're dressed too lightly.

593
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,530
It's May, but still chilly

594
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,810
in the mornings and evenings.

595
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,090
I'll go pick up the supplies later.

596
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,570
They made new uniforms for me.

597
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,290
But uniforms are all standard sizes,

598
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,490
none fit you well.

599
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,410
How about this?

600
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,460
I'll have Chunniang

601
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,050
tailor them for you.

602
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,780
That won't be necessary.

603
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,980
I can wear them.

604
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,730
How can you wear them if they don't fit you?

605
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,140
Look at mine.

606
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,530
Her Ladyship tailored all of these for me.

607
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,220
That's what makes it comfortable.

608
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,370
My Lord.

609
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,260
It's getting late.

610
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,380
You should go back.

611
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,440
No rush.

612
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,660
Let me tell you a few things.

613
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,730
- Tomorrow, you...
- Her Ladyship

614
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,010
asked you to go back.

615
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,180
Her Ladyship asked?

616
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,730
Didn't you have something to say?

617
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,980
Please, I'm listening.

618
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,290
It's nothing important.

619
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,490
We can talk another day.

620
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,660
You always puts work first, My Lord.

621
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,040
If you return later,

622
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,220
Her Ladyship can wait for you.

623
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,660
I told you,

624
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,980
it's nothing important.

625
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,490
If she can wait, so can you.

626
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,090
Later then.

627
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,460
His Lordship doesn't seem busy with work.

628
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,900
Or maybe he is, but he jokes

629
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,770
with us just for fun.

630
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,570
Are we that funny?

631
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,460
Except you.

632
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,530
He keeps saying "lady this, lady that."

633
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,860
Why doesn't he go back sooner?

634
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,660
Feels like he's showing off.

635
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,420
Maybe even trying to humiliate us.

636
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,010
Now, Her Ladyship and His Lordship

637
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,940
seems to grow closer every day.

638
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,180
Almost like newlyweds.

639
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,420
Her Ladyship's mourning ends soon.

640
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,770
No wonder they're like newlyweds.

641
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,420
You're too young for this.

642
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,020
(Mansion of Liangya's Heir, Liangya State)

643
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,180
If you want to resist Wei State, My Lord,

644
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,420
you must first take Panyi.

645
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,660
To reach Panyi,

646
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,460
you have to pass through Boya,

647
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,490
Xindu,

648
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,700
and Xiaogang,

649
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,170
each heavily fortified,

650
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,050
easy to defend, hard to take.

651
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,170
But Liancheng

652
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,340
lies right on Yanzhou's border,

653
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,020
nestled in the mountains,

654
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,210
and is poorly defended.

655
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,860
My Lord, why not start with Liancheng,

656
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,050
then take move on to Xiaogang,

657
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,820
killing two birds with one stone.

658
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,420
Isn't that the ideal plan?

659
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,650
Lady Yulou, it's easy for you to say that.

660
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,940
Xiaogang is hard

661
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,210
to take,

662
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,940
and between Liancheng and Xiaogang

663
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,090
lies Mount Lian-gang.

664
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,740
Marching through it

665
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,210
will wear out our troops.

666
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,900
If that happens,

667
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,940
our chances of victory will only worsen.

668
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,010
The key to this battle

669
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,170
is Mount Lian-gang.

670
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,610
Once, I disguised myself

671
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,210
and patrolled the borders.

672
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
By chance,

673
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,380
I found a hidden path

674
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,940
in Mount Lian-gang.

675
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,380
It connects Liancheng and Xiaogang.

676
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,170
I asked around,

677
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,860
and it turns out General Bi Zhi of Boya

678
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,050
secretly

679
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,300
ordered its construction.

680
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,940
My Lord, you're wise.

681
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,780
Surely, you know

682
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,170
who's behind this.

683
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,930
(Military Map)
My cousin

684
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,260
is a scheming woman.

685
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,090
Good thing she married Wei Shao.

686
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,170
In fact, I should thank her schemes

687
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,420
for creating this opportunity for you.

688
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,050
My Lord,

689
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,530
I've placed my winning strategy

690
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,130
in your hands.

691
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,490
Does that show my sincerity?

692
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,570
Lady Yulou, remember

693
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,210
how you refused to travel with me,

694
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,490
enchanted by the beauty of Yujun?

695
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,010
Why do you change your mind?

696
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,130
At the time, my husband had just died.

697
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,340
As one born with an empress's fate,

698
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,780
whoever wins me,

699
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,050
wins the Central Plains.

700
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,610
Everyone sought my fortune,

701
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
but only out of lust.

702
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,610
They were not true heroes.

703
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,340
I once thought you were the same.

704
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,260
But after you left, I realized,

705
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,780
Chijun

706
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,690
is where I truly belong.

707
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,420
Your ambition

708
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,170
impresses me, My Lord.

709
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,010
Lady Yulou, do you mean to

710
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,130
follow me in this life?

711
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,980
Please do not misconstrue my intent.

712
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,090
I'm not here to propose marriage,

713
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,980
but to forge an alliance.

714
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,970
An alliance?

715
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,860
What do you stand on? The secret path,

716
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,780
or the huadian

717
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,130
on your forehead,

718
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,530
the possibly fake empress's fate?

719
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,050
I stand on my late husband's will,

720
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,570
the loyalty of General Xue Tai,

721
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,900
and 50,000 elite troops

722
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,420
stationed in Juejun.

723
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,010
My Lord,

724
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,900
relying on beauty to serve
is the most degrading way.

725
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,570
I don't serve anyone
seeking to rule the realm.

726
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,210
Instead, I'm the one

727
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,050
who decides who will.

728
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,900
The Wei family wronged me.

729
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,170
Lady Qiao wronged you.

730
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,130
Is our alliance

731
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,300
destined by heaven, My Lord?

732
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,300
I heard the Lord of Liangya
has rallied his forces

733
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,610
and is ready to march.

734
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,820
So, the first step

735
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,340
is a success.

736
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,780
Lady Yulou?

737
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,460
Lady Yulou,

738
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,860
His Lordship wishes to speak with you.

739
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,650
About the battle plans?

740
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,820
Not exactly.

741
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,690
Someone from the Su Clan of Wushan has come.

742
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,130
His Lordship wants you to meet him.

743
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,140
My Lord.

744
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,010
Lady Yulou,

745
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,140
My Lord,

746
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,490
by order of the patriarch,

747
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,090
I have come to Liangya to arrange

748
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,490
Lady Yulou's marriage.

749
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,490
Governor of Taozhou came in person,

750
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,690
offering one million in silver,

751
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,940
hundreds of duan of silk,

752
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,130
twelve hu of wine,

753
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,130
twelve hu of every grain,

754
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,490
and twenty years of tribute from two counties

755
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,130
all to seek Lady Yulou's hand
from Wushan State,

756
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,650
as a concubine.

757
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,410
Outrageous!

758
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,690
I now command 50,000 troops in Juejun.

759
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,490
I will not be a concubine.

760
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,940
Lady Yulou, you may not realize,

761
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,260
but Governor of Taozhou

762
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,300
offers these gifts because of your troops.

763
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,570
That's why he's willing to
give up two counties' tribute.

764
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,050
Otherwise, as a remarried woman,
how could you

765
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,010
expect such generous betrothal gifts?

766
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,050
But lately, the patriarch learned

767
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,490
that Lady Yulou is residing in Liangya State,

768
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,300
and wondered if His Lordship

769
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,260
wishes to marry you.

770
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,010
But, he hasn't seen the Lord of Liangya

771
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,370
grant Lady Yulou her title.

772
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,300
The patriarch is confused,

773
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,740
so he sent me here to inquire.

774
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,310
His Lordship, if you enjoys
Lady Yulou's company,

775
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,260
and speak with no intent

776
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,610
of taking her as a concubine,

777
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,690
then may Lady Yulou

778
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,690
return home with me

779
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,820
and marry as soon as possible.

780
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,570
I do not intend to take a concubine.

781
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,570
Lady Yulou, please

782
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,980
return home with me.

783
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,570
I'll grant two counties

784
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,740
as Lady Yulou's personal fief,

785
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,820
along with double
Governor of Taozhou's betrothal gifts,

786
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,530
to present to Lady Yulou

787
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,420
as my formal proposal.

788
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,900
I, Liu Yan,

789
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,300
sincerely wish to marry Lady Yulou

790
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:48,980
and make her my wife.
