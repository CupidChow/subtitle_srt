You don't have to leave.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm going now to pack

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,830
and leave this filthy place.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,040
What nonsense is this?

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,390
Ci.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,160
- My Lord, you...
- Enough, Mr. Zhang.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,520
Don't make it worse.

37
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,470
I...

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,630
You're right, My Lord.

39
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,400
The soil here
is well-suited for construction.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,160
And it's close to the Yongning Canal.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
If we redirect the water and build the canal

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,350
with proper dams,

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,630
it can be used for irrigation.

44
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,280
This truly is a good place to settle.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,470
Wei Liang, Wei Qu, Wei Xiao.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,730
You three,

47
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,350
take some men to gather timber and stone.

48
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,070
- Yes.
- Yes.

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Wei Duo,

50
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,190
come here.

51
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
Head to Panyi

52
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,400
and arrange the hydraulic works.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,280
Also, bring me Yang Feng's book.

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,510
Yes, My Lord.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,350
Our journey will be delayed
by a few more days.

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,630
But once the displaced people are settled,

57
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,070
we'll return to Yujun.

58
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,190
Alright.

59
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,230
Your arrow wound hasn't healed yet.

60
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,470
You've worked hard.

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,350
It's nothing serious.

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,790
What matters now is helping them

63
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,880
guide the water.

64
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,910
I remember you once said

65
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,160
there's much to know about hydraulic works,

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,440
like

67
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,470
how weather conditions,
whether sunny or rainy,

68
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,400
cold or warm,

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,720
can affect and delay the progress.

70
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,070
Yes.

71
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,750
So, how did Yanzhou

72
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,040
forecast the weather?

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,560
We observed clouds and stars.

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
What a pity.

75
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,720
I don't know any of that.

76
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,440
And you, My Lady?

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,160
I know a little.

78
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,160
That's great.

79
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,560
I plan to help them rebuild their homes,

80
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,040
but I worry the work will move slowly

81
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,190
and delay our return.

82
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,350
This place is high in elevation,

83
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,720
better than the observatory.

84
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,470
My Lady, would you

85
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,230
be willing to teach me how to

86
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,600
observe the stars tonight?

87
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,750
I share your concerns, My Lord.

88
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,000
But I only know

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,910
the basics.

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm not nearly as good as Lord Yang.

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,910
How about this? Let's ask a General

92
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,350
to go invite Lord Yang here.

93
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,790
The three of us can go together.

94
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,750
I don't think so.

95
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,230
All my men are out on errands.

96
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,510
There's no one left to fetch him.

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,230
Honestly, I'm worried

98
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,200
I won't get it right

99
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,910
and I'll only delay your plans.

100
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
You've delayed me

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,230
more than enough.

102
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,760
What's one more thing?

103
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,060
Then I have no choice but to obey.

104
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,520
Ci.

105
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,870
Aunt, it's so late.

106
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
You're still not resting?

107
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,200
I was worried you might sneak out tonight.

108
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,870
Aunt, what do you mean by that?

109
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,470
What I said earlier today

110
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,040
was just to scare Uncle.

111
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,910
How could I possibly wander off alone

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,280
and make everyone worry?

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,280
If you were traveling along the main road,

114
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,040
with the official letter in hand,

115
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,160
escorted by guards

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,350
heading toward Boya,

117
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,910
we wouldn't be so worried.

118
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,920
Come on, come on.

119
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,090
Come, eat.

120
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,380
- Slow down.
- We'll have a good life.

121
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,720
The view here is nice,

122
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,960
and it's peaceful too.

123
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,760
Yes, it is.

124
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,230
Because Yang Feng isn't here.

125
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
There are no stars tonight.

126
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,040
You changed your hairpin today.

127
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,670
You noticed that?

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
Of course.

129
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,840
Yesterday, I thought you'd been abducted.

130
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,230
When I found you,

131
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,450
I searched you

132
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,430
from head to toe.

133
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,020
That hairpin you wore yesterday

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,100
had an orchid on it.

135
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,260
Today's doesn't.

136
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,300
Take a look at the back.

137
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,540
I just turned it around.

138
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,660
Yesterday, I was desperate to find you.

139
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,140
All my thoughts were on you.

140
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,900
It's no wonder I didn't notice.

141
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Thank you for thinking of me, My Lord.

142
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Actually,

143
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,860
when I thought you'd been abducted yesterday,

144
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,980
I was truly afraid.

145
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,980
I was afraid

146
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,780
you might suddenly

147
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
leave me,

148
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,740
just like Grandfather,

149
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,060
Father, and Brother did.

150
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,180
You're an exceptional lady.

151
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,700
And I have to admit,

152
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,500
I've never admired any woman
the way I admire you.

153
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,180
At first, I thought

154
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
marriage was just marriage.

155
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
But after spending time with you,

156
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,620
I started to feel something for you.

157
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,860
Now, I'm afraid of falling too deep

158
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,260
and regretting it later.

159
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,580
I felt the same.

160
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,660
Marriage was just marriage.

161
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,140
I didn't have many feelings
for you back then.

162
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,220
But I admire
how you care for the whole realm,

163
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,180
how you're willing to put aside the feud

164
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
between the Qiao and Wei clans
for this canal.

165
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,580
And now, you even
offer shelter to the displaced.

166
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,700
Great.

167
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,980
From now on,

168
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,060
we won't have to wander.

169
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,420
We can finally settle down.

170
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,700
These past few days,

171
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,780
watching them suffer,

172
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,860
I've come to truly understand

173
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,340
how the fight over water

174
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,540
has brought pain to innocent lives.

175
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,340
So, I have a wish

176
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,260
that one day, all tribes

177
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,580
might be joined by a single lifeline,

178
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,260
and the chaos may end.

179
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,180
But I don't know

180
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,020
if that wish can ever come true.

181
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,960
This is way better than how we were living

182
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,660
- The chaos has lasted too long.
- a few days ago.

183
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,900
To achieve peace and greatness,

184
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,700
sometimes war must be used to end war.

185
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,940
If Yanzhou hadn't turned them away,

186
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,020
they wouldn't have met us.

187
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,420
Are you afraid that one day,

188
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,220
you and I will stand on opposing sides?

189
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,140
I'm afraid this peace

190
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
may not last long.

191
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,220
Even if peace lasts only for a moment,

192
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,660
a sincere heart can make

193
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,900
its echo last for generations.

194
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,780
I make a solemn vow

195
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,780
to follow you with the loyalty of a subject.

196
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,420
No matter what lies ahead, peace or chaos,

197
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,260
I will remain loyal to you

198
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,220
and never leave you.

199
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,820
I will stand by your side,

200
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,340
helping to complete the canal,

201
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,300
facing hardships together,

202
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,580
bringing water to all regions,

203
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,900
ending wars,

204
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,580
and dissolving hatred

205
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,900
with genuine sincerity,

206
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,300
to bring peace to the whole realm.

207
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,980
Why didn't you keep an eye on Ci?

208
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,580
You just let him leave like that?

209
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,380
He's grown up now.

210
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,500
He left with Lady Ding.

211
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,820
How could I stop him?

212
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,460
He's always been strong-willed

213
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,820
and hard to control.

214
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,620
A grown son can't be held back by his father.

215
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,380
If Father were still alive,

216
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,780
and forbade you from chasing after beauties,

217
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,900
would you have listened?

218
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,420
If Father couldn't rein you in,

219
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,220
how do you expect to watch over Ci?

220
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,740
How much money did he take?

221
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,300
Young Master Ci took
a fair amount of valuables,

222
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,540
enough for his needs.

223
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,620
Did he bring any good weapons?

224
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,180
He took his usual silver spear

225
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,020
and a short sword.

226
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,140
Was he escorted?

227
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,260
Yes, his personal guards went with him.

228
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,580
(Don't look for me.)
Do you know where he went?

229
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,420
(I'll return one day. By Qiao Ci)

230
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,940
He went to Boya, carrying an official letter

231
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,260
from the prefect.

232
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,500
Official letter?

233
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,980
So, he's not running away.

234
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,220
He's visiting relatives.

235
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,700
(Boya)

236
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,620
It's windy here.

237
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,900
Don't catch a cold.

238
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,340
Mother.

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,900
Ci.

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,260
This is our home now.

241
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,740
Fan.

242
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,140
You've suffered so much away from home.

243
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,460
If you love Bi Zhi,

244
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,780
just tell us.

245
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,100
Why leave without a word,

246
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,620
only to end up like this?

247
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,100
Mother,

248
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,420
Bi Zhi treats me very well.

249
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,220
I'm not suffering.

250
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,100
You don't need to hide it from me.

251
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,020
I'm not blaming him.

252
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,420
I'm just worried about you.

253
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,500
When you were at home,

254
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,860
how could you live

255
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,620
in a place like this?

256
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,620
You didn't bring

257
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,980
your konghou from home.

258
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,780
Luckily, you found another fine one.

259
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,340
How else would you find comfort?

260
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,980
This zither

261
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,500
was custom-made for me by Bi Zhi.

262
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,780
Because of it,

263
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,660
we unexpectedly gained Boya.

264
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,460
Is that so?

265
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,380
I heard about this back in Kangjun.

266
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,100
Commander of Boya Forces overthrew Xue Tai

267
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,700
because of a carpenter.

268
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,700
I thought it was just a rumor.

269
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,580
But it seems he's been good to you.

270
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,580
Xing,

271
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,340
have those dozen or so weasels
in the yard been fed?

272
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,180
Yes.

273
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,180
Why are you raising weasels now?

274
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,340
Bi Zhi once saw Liu Yan offer

275
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,020
a weasel as a betrothal gift to Manman,

276
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,500
so he caught some for me.

277
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,050
To please me,

278
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,100
he caught over a dozen in one go.

279
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,620
Liu Yan was just going through the motions,

280
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,260
but Bi Zhi truly means it.

281
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,700
We don't really need that lynx.

282
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,020
What we lack

283
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,700
is the heart Bi Zhi showed
when he caught those weasels.

284
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,620
Mother, you are absolutely right.

285
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,580
Fan,

286
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,660
seeing you doing well

287
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,540
puts my heart at ease.

288
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,100
Mother,

289
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,460
since you came all this way,

290
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,100
why not stay here in Boya with Ci

291
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,180
and spend the New Year with us?

292
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,260
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

293
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,220
Grandmother.

294
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,420
Grandmother.

295
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,020
Zhonglin and Lady Qiao are back.

296
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,660
Grandmother.

297
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,660
How did things go

298
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,860
in Rongjun?

299
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Quite smoothly.

300
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,140
And with Yang Feng's help

301
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,380
in Panyi,

302
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,260
the canal should be well on its way.

303
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,500
That's good to hear.

304
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,340
Along the way,

305
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,380
you kept him company

306
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,540
through wind and rain.

307
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,500
Thank you for that.

308
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,420
It was nothing.

309
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,740
Everyone, have a seat.

310
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,860
Thanks, Grandmother.

311
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,180
Serve the tea.

312
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,460
Yes.

313
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,900
Zhonglin,

314
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,020
travel food's nothing like
a home-cooked meal.

315
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,060
Come to my place tomorrow.

316
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,820
I'll prepare wine and some delicacies

317
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,220
to welcome you back.

318
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,180
Great.

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,180
Is your injury healed

320
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,540
enough for alcohol?

321
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
You're injured?

322
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,240
Just a small wound,

323
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,100
nothing serious.

324
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,420
I've been up and about these days.

325
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,900
It's fine. No problem.

326
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,940
Grandmother,

327
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,380
we brought back some specialties
from Rongjun.

328
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,220
I'll go fetch them with Xiaotao.

329
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,060
Okay.

330
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,500
Zhonglin,

331
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,980
your wife cares for you

332
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,500
with great tenderness.

333
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,500
Yes,

334
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,340
Her Ladyship is very thoughtful.

335
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,140
But that only matters if it's for you.

336
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,540
Her thoughts are

337
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,100
all with the people of Wei State.

338
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,540
That's caring for all under her roof.

339
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
I think Lady Qiao

340
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,900
genuinely cares about you.

341
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Genuine or not,

342
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,940
she's just a bit clever,

343
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,740
so I listen to her sometimes.

344
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm a noble lord.

345
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,020
How could I

346
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,860
be lost in romance every day?

347
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,820
Exactly.

348
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,380
That's the spirit of a true man.

349
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,220
Is that right?

350
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,540
Yes.

351
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,940
My Lady,

352
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,340
stay and chat with Grandmother.

353
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,980
Grandmother,

354
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,060
I've just returned.

355
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,780
I should go greet Mother.

356
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,620
I'll take my leave.

357
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Go ahead.

358
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,820
Yes.

359
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,820
Zhonglin?

360
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,020
Zhonglin?

361
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,500
Grandmother.

362
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
Zhonglin!

363
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,020
Ma'am.

364
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,420
His Lordship has come to see you.

365
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,740
Zhonglin, you're here.

366
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,580
Mother.

367
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,540
You found time

368
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,420
to see me today, huh?

369
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,700
I brought you fruits from Rongjun

370
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,780
and some jewelry,

371
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,980
so I thought I'd visit you.

372
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
If you're busy,

373
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,220
you don't have to come see me.

374
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,420
About the wheat seeds,

375
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,580
- it's all my fault...
- Mother,

376
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
let's not

377
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,780
bring up the past.

378
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,060
Alright, not another word.

379
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,940
Have a seat.

380
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,580
Try some fruits.

381
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,420
Lady Qiao picked

382
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,220
these pieces just for you.

383
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,340
(This is way too sour.)

384
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,580
Look at this hairpin.

385
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,420
Do you like it?

386
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,420
Mother?

387
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,580
Why are you crying?

388
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,500
Please

389
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,980
don't be too upset.

390
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,140
You did make a mistake

391
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,820
with the wheat seeds,

392
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,740
but I understand,

393
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,620
you couldn't let go of Brother and Father.

394
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,260
It was my fault.

395
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,940
I blamed you in my heart

396
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,780
for always thinking of the dead

397
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,940
and ignoring me.

398
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,140
But wasn't I the same?

399
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,260
I ignored how you felt,

400
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,180
so you had to confide in others.

401
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Zhonglin,

402
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,220
I don't want you

403
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,060
caught between me and her.

404
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,740
So,

405
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,540
I accept her

406
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,340
as my daughter-in-law.

407
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,260
It's not hard for me to accept her.

408
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,460
I'm just worried about you.

409
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Lady Qiao is sharp with words.

410
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,180
I'm afraid you can't take her on.

411
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,140
You're the one who needs to be
comfortable in your own life.

412
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,700
So,

413
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,220
whatever you do,

414
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
you should

415
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,460
keep her in check.

416
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,980
Don't let her get the upper hand.

417
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,740
Could it be

418
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,980
you've already fallen for her?

419
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,740
No, I haven't.

420
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,980
I'm here to visit you today.

421
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,300
Let's not talk about her.

422
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,980
See?

423
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,020
You clearly like her.

424
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,740
Try this one.

425
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,380
Does it taste good?

426
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,060
I sent some to Grandmother this morning.

427
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,180
It's so good.

428
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,100
Go on, try it.

429
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,700
Tastes good, right?

430
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,260
Mother,

431
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,340
it's too sour!

432
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,540
Anything from my son

433
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,620
tastes sweet to me.

434
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,460
Look.

435
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,620
You're back, My Lord.

436
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,980
Today, you had me

437
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,820
send those sour fruits as gifts.

438
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,860
What are you up to?

439
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,780
Are they sour?

440
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,220
Try one yourself.

441
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,020
I was spoiled growing up.

442
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,180
Back then,

443
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,460
whenever I got upset,

444
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,180
I'd run into Aunt's arms and cry,

445
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,940
telling her exactly what I wanted.

446
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,700
You're the strong-willed type.

447
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,540
I bet you never did that with Mother.

448
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,020
Mother is a straightforward person.

449
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,340
One of you has to give in first,

450
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,380
so the other can soften.

451
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,580
I do appreciate

452
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
how much you care for me.

453
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,100
I know I'm just a bit clever,

454
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,980
like you told Grandmother.

455
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,900
I meant it sincerely,

456
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,300
not sarcastically.

457
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,420
I know you always

458
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,380
say the opposite of what you feel.

459
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,100
You've come a long way,

460
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,020
and haven't had a break today.

461
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,860
I'll have a bath prepared for you

462
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,740
to help you unwind.

463
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,140
Alright.

464
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,580
Could it be

465
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,820
you've already fallen for her?

466
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,540
See?

467
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
You clearly like her.

Grandfather.

492
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,780
Father.

493
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,820
Brother.

494
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,660
Are you blaming me

495
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,180
for falling for Lady Qiao?

496
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,900
Brother!

497
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,060
(Grandmother wants me to let go of hatred)

498
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,980
(and live happily with her.)

499
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,380
(Is it even possible?)

500
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,140
(Can I really do that?)

501
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,700
(Winter)

502
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,780
(Government Hall, Wei State)

503
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,780
(Yongning)

504
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,620
This journey has brought us

505
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,500
a new city, Yongning.

506
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,340
Though its people

507
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,860
are not originally of Wei,

508
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,820
since we've taken them in,

509
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,220
we should treat them as our own.

510
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,580
Do you understand?

511
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,860
Yes, My Lord.

512
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,180
There are tens of thousands of people

513
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,140
suffering from the war.

514
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,220
What we've seen

515
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,820
is only the tip of the iceberg.

516
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,260
So,

517
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,620
I have a wish.

518
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
I hope you'll help me see it fulfilled.

519
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,420
I want to build canals,

520
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,020
starting from Panyi,

521
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,420
stretching far and wide,

522
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,620
reaching every region.

523
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,780
So that all people

524
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,220
will no longer fight over water.

525
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,700
They can

526
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,180
finally live in peace.

527
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,380
A wise decision, My Lord.

528
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,500
This deed

529
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,780
will benefit countless souls and lives.

530
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,620
My Lord,

531
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,740
your care for the people
shines as bright as the sun.

532
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,780
However,

533
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,940
fighting over water

534
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,100
is but a symptom.

535
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,940
The rivalries

536
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,740
between clans run deep.

537
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,020
Ending the conflict

538
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,620
won't be so easy.

539
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,860
This is the wisdom
behind His Lordship's plan.

540
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,500
Peace needs

541
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,740
both ink and arms.

542
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,140
Canal construction

543
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,420
follows the example
of the Qiao-Wei alliance,

544
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,820
a civil solution

545
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,180
to avoid bloodshed.

546
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,500
However, I fear not all factions

547
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,020
and clans will agree.

548
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,580
So, Her Ladyship and I have decided

549
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,340
to hold a Deer Hunt.

550
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,740
When the time comes,

551
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,340
we'll invite all powers to gather

552
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,860
and discuss canal construction.

553
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,180
We'll appeal to their shared interests,

554
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,340
to persuade each faction

555
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,780
to unite and work together.

556
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,180
It's not urgent yet,

557
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,460
but we must prepare in advance.

558
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,300
Sir, please

559
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,860
draft the invitation list

560
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,220
and hand it to Her Ladyship.

561
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,460
Yes.

562
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,300
Her Ladyship?

563
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,380
She just went to Rongjun, and now

564
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,060
she's handling state affairs?

565
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,540
She's family.

566
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
It won't be a problem.

567
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,220
Why didn't you go to Luozhong Tavern with me?

568
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,660
Why insist on drinking at home?

569
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,860
What noble lord just returned home

570
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,420
and heads to a tavern?

571
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,100
So, My Lord,

572
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,220
how many days before you

573
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,100
join me there?

574
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,220
That's never gonna happen.

575
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,220
Zhonglin, are you afraid of your wife?

576
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,740
Afraid of her? Me?

577
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
Don't be ridiculous.

578
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,950
So what if you are?

579
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,460
Honestly, I envy you.

580
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,420
No one loves me

581
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,940
or truly cares for me like that.

582
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,620
You know,

583
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,180
if you want to settle down,

584
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,420
Grandmother will find you

585
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,700
the best match.

586
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,260
A good marriage

587
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,380
is never easy.

588
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,550
Some couples

589
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,860
treat each other

590
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,140
with respect and formality,

591
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,620
while others share deep affection

592
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,940
and true understanding.

593
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,940
Since you're so insightful,

594
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,460
let me ask you something.

595
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,540
Can I

596
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,420
allow myself

597
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,540
to fall for Lady Qiao?

598
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
You cannot.

599
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,980
The Qiao family harmed our kin.

600
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,100
We both know the pain
of losing family since childhood.

601
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,460
I know all of that.

602
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,740
But those choices were
her Grandfather's, not hers.

603
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,220
If we were in her place,

604
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,380
we'd face the same dilemma.

605
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,620
Still, she used you

606
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,460
to take Boya

607
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,180
and keep Panyi in check.

608
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,580
That's a fact, isn't it?

609
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,900
At the time, we were in a power struggle.

610
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,580
Of course, we both held back a little.

611
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,980
But now, look at her.

612
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,620
She helped me with the Yongning Canal

613
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,020
and even put Yang Feng at my service.

614
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,620
That shows she has no hidden agenda.

615
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,740
What about her family?

616
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,580
Everyone knows

617
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,180
they're as cold as ice.

618
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,260
With your temperament,

619
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,420
you'd have to burn yourself

620
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,800
just to thaw their frozen hearts.

621
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,700
You've got it wrong.

622
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,420
She's warm-hearted

623
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,380
and truly cares for me.

624
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,740
She's not as cold as you say.

625
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,380
Sounds like you can't live without her.

626
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,580
Why bother to ask me?

627
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,460
Honestly,

628
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,740
you've fallen for her,

629
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,660
but your filial piety holds you back.

630
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,460
That'll only

631
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,340
make it harder for yourself.

632
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,620
Look,

633
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,300
it spread its tail.

634
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,180
Even that bird shows more
genuine feeling than you.

635
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,020
Mr. Wei,

636
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,900
I made you some herbal sobering soup.

637
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,100
What intoxicates is not wine,

638
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,540
but love.

639
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
Lanyun,

640
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,940
bring me a brush.

641
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,060
Feeling inspired?

642
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,180
What do you plan to draw?

643
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,220
Have you heard the tale
of the Goddess of Yushan?

644
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,620
I...

645
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,260
My knowledge is shallow.

646
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,060
I haven't heard of it.

647
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,860
A weary scholar lost his way in deep woods.

648
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,020
He wandered into a hidden clearing,

649
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,940
where he saw the goddess at her bath.

650
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,020
She moved like drifting mist,
graceful and elusive,

651
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,900
a beauty to steal one's breath away.

652
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,620
With one sway, flowers blossomed;

653
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,940
with another, the grass withered.

654
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,140
So serene, like tiger and hare at peace,
or sun and moon in quiet grace.

655
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,100
The scholar's heart stirred.

656
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,060
He longed to go to her,

657
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,820
yet feared she'd vanish the moment he did.

658
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,540
He was torn

659
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,540
between longing and fear.

660
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,380
In love,

661
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,580
hesitation is the greatest foe.

662
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,060
The more one worries,

663
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,500
the heavier the burden,

664
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,740
until there's no freedom,

665
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,780
only knots

666
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,900
and no joy.

667
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,940
Why did you stop, Mr. Wei?

668
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,700
Without facial features,

669
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,860
this Goddess of Yushan

670
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,060
is incomplete.

671
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
There's no goddess in my heart,

672
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,420
so how could I know

673
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,820
what she looks like?

674
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,060
Honestly,

675
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,500
you've fallen for her,

676
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,620
but your filial piety holds you back.

677
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,660
That'll only

678
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
make it harder for yourself.

679
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,100
You're back, My Lord.

680
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,660
Your face is quite flushed.

681
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,460
It's nothing. I had some wine.

682
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,980
Here, warm your hands with this.

683
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,420
There's a lot going on

684
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,620
at the Government Office lately.

685
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,380
I'll need to stay there for a while.

686
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,980
Have someone pack

687
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,060
my things.

688
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,060
But it's cold and damp there.

689
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,740
Do you really have to go?

690
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,100
Let me help you take off your robe first.

691
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,220
How long

692
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,420
will you be gone?

693
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,860
Just for three days,

694
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,340
for now.

695
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,900
I'll have it arranged.

696
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,060
Alright.

697
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,900
I...

698
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,820
Sorry, I drank too much today.

699
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,980
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

700
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,420
Shall I have hot water

701
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,860
prepared for a bath?

702
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,460
No need.

703
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,420
I'll sleep

704
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,380
at the office tonight.

705
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,380
Good night.

706
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,620
My Lord?

707
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,180
It's so late.

708
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,140
May I ask why we've been summoned?

709
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,940
It's already late, you know.

710
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,570
If there's nothing urgent,

711
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,880
you should head back and get some rest.

712
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,460
I wouldn't call you here without a reason.

713
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,500
Yes, My Lord.

714
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,820
My Lord,

715
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,260
what is it? Please say it.

716
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,460
I was thinking…

717
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,780
Yanzhou...

718
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,620
It's at peace now.

719
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,340
No, not Yanzhou.

720
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,850
- Bianzhou...
- Just died.

721
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,500
Oh, right.

722
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,190
I meant Yaozhou...

723
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,220
There is a famed beauty in Yaozhou.

724
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,340
But I suppose that's not what you meant.

725
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,300
Actually, I was saying

726
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,500
that Liangya State...

727
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,020
Are we launching an attack on Liangya?

728
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,860
No, not an attack.

729
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,980
All those regions I just mentioned

730
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,780
will be at the Deer Hunt.

731
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,900
We must begin preparations.

732
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,740
What do you think?

733
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,340
Yes.

734
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,420
Yes, of course.

735
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,460
This is an important matter.

736
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,340
It is.

737
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,300
We must not neglect

738
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,580
the matter of the venue,

739
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,140
nor the proper reception.

740
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,740
So,

741
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,100
we must treat it seriously.

742
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

743
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,900
What...

744
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,900
Sir.

745
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,580
I just remembered

746
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,500
it's been a while

747
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,980
since I last visited Madam.

748
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,380
So,

749
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,740
I shall go with you

750
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,900
and pay her a brief visit.

751
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,700
- Alright, that's it.
- My Lord, she...

752
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,900
Let's go.

753
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,860
Let's go.

754
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,380
His Lordship is really diligent.

755
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,780
He rushed back here so late

756
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,220
just for the Deer Hunt?

757
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,700
It is important,

758
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,900
but not that urgent.

759
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,860
Isn't the Deer Hunt next spring?

760
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,540
Maybe he quarreled with Her Ladyship?

761
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,620
Shall we talk to Mr. Wei?

762
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,860
Mr. Wei's busy.

763
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,020
He has been painting

764
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,660
with tavern maids at Luozhong Tavern lately.

765
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,820
Let's go.

766
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,180
My Lady,

767
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,180
are these clothes enough for three days?

768
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,580
That'll do. Pack them up.

769
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,820
My Lady, I'll take them

770
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,460
to His Lordship now.

771
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,340
Alright.

772
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,620
His Lordship just got back,
now he's moving out again.

773
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,540
Why is His Lordship so hot and cold?

774
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
Maybe he just needs time to think.

775
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,700
That might not be such a bad thing.

776
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,940
I really don't understand

777
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,540
what you've been saying lately.

778
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,700
His Lordship is clearly
acting against his heart,

779
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,420
yet you still go along with him.

780
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,340
Even you can tell that.

781
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,460
Why should I rush?

782
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,740
Let him think.

783
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,300
I'll have things to do.

784
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,740
What's gotten into Zhonglin?

785
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,060
He moved to the Government Office?

786
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,980
Poor Lady Qiao,

787
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,980
left all alone once again.

788
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,700
You really

789
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,540
do side with Her Ladyship now.

790
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,740
Now, I see

791
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,300
what's troubling Zhonglin.

792
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,300
He keeps avoiding Lady Qiao

793
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,780
because he's falling for her.

794
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,580
Nothing gets past you, huh?

795
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,580
Sometimes,

796
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,540
you've got to cut yourself some slack.

797
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,340
Look at Lady Zhu.

798
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,900
Her life hasn't been all that hard.

799
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,340
Ma'am, Her Ladyship requests to see you.

800
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,140
Let her in.

801
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,980
Yes, Ma'am.

802
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,260
His Lordship has been busy
with court affairs.

803
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,060
I don't want to be idle either.

804
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,660
Is there anything I can do

805
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,940
for you, Grandmother?

806
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,780
Yes.

807
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,180
Zhonglin is making plans for the Deer Hunt.

808
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,820
I want to

809
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,100
turn the city drill ground

810
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,660
into the Deer Hunt venue.

811
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,100
It needs some renovation.

812
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,940
Can you handle it?

813
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,940
I'm willing to give it a try.

814
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,340
I'll assign you some help.

815
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,780
Thank you, Grandmother.

816
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,220
But I have another idea.

817
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,180
What is it?

818
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,380
The Deer Hunt will invite
powers from all regions

819
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,300
to discuss canal construction together.

820
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,100
For such a grand event,

821
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,060
why not have someone

822
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
write some poems and prose

823
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,340
to promote it?

824
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,020
That way, it would spread

825
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,380
His Lordship's visions,

826
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,220
and also,

827
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,620
the powers will share the glory,

828
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,860
making them more likely to attend.

829
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,260
That's a brilliant idea.

830
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,620
Let's do as you propose.

831
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,020
I'll do my best, Grandmother.

832
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,780
Go tell Zhonglin

833
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,100
that I've entrusted Lady Qiao

834
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,060
with the Deer Hunt Venue.

835
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,660
Let's see how can he can avoid her now.

836
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,900
Who said I can't live without her?

837
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,780
I think the Government Office

838
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,100
is far better than home.

839
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,820
At least here, I feel free.
