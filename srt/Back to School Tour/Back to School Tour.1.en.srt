1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,254
Welcome to HVIS.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,089
And now we just finished-

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,841
3, 2, 1, and action!

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,346
What's up everybody today!

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,223
Welcome back!

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,735
Welcome to HVIS!

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,321
And we just finished
our establishing shots.

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,823
And look!

9
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,283
The sunset is so beautiful.

10
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,175
I sort of reminisced our first taping day

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,801
in season one.

12
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,319
Because it’s the same place.

13
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,889
And I remember we took so long here.

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,141
To shoot that scene here.

15
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,934
It’s right here. Here, here.

16
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,145
It took so long.

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,563
And it was so hot!

18
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,107
When I got home I was like, whoa!

19
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,333
I was taken aback.

20
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,695
But yeah, since we’re working now,

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,906
do you want to go upstairs?

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,003
Welcome to our new location!

23
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,998
The rooftop.

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,722
So we just finished the rooftop sequences.

25
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:42,059
And we have 3 to 4 sequences here.

26
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,278
And...

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,188
It’s so hard.

28
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,707
I was having a hard time.

29
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,525
Sorry, Director.

30
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,901
But yeah, we’re done.

31
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,960
And...

32
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,405
There, can you see that? Eatmore2behappy.

33
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,241
Watson’s army.

34
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,951
Mariano Square.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,707
Oh!

36
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,684
It says “squad.”

37
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,479
I don’t know.

38
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,756
Mariano’s squad.

39
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,012
Welcome to...

40
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,473
Section A’s building.

41
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,860
Let's go to their classroom.

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,694
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,949
So, guys we’re doing a tour of this school.

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,035
A university here in BGC.

45
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,497
And this is the-

46
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,082
What is this, Ash?

47
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,126
It’s Section A.

48
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,045
This is the classroom of Section A.

49
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,132
So, my scene here is when they hurt me.

50
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,842
Keifer pushed me.

51
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,677
He hurt my feelings.

52
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,595
Yes, uhm...

53
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,848
just watch out for that scene

54
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,391
here in Section A. Right?

55
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,059
- Yes!
- Yes!

56
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,103
Let’s go. We’re going home.

57
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,104
We’re going home.

58
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,231
That too. We’re also going home.

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,649
So now we have uh-

60
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,569
Rafa Victorino, the Tiktoker.

61
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,655
- A very diligent Tiktoker.
- So, what can you say?

62
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,682
Thank you so, so much for a wonderful day.

63
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,918
See you on our next location!

64
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,384
What's up, everybody?

65
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,137
Today or tonight, we are gonna do

66
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,680
our Section E...

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,890
- our Section E...
- Set tour.

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,824
Set tour.

69
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,683
Set tour.

70
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,353
Yes, and the first thing
we can see here is...

71
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,796
Mayet is ugly.

72
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,049
Yes!

73
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,024
So please come along.

74
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,049
- Let's go.
- Let’s go.

75
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,070
3, 2, 1, action!

76
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,158
Cut!

77
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,956
We’re going to Section E’s classroom.

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,170
Amidst the chaos, this
is a great hangout place.

79
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,922
Amen. Amen.

80
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
We’ll this room....

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,387
This is where legends are made.

82
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,947
[staff teasing]

83
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,099
That’s so cool.

84
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,148
I'm sure you’ve seen this in the series.

85
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,275
This is the-

86
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,125
Yes.

87
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,693
Blackboard.

88
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,277
Blackboard.

89
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,002
Chalk board.

90
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,737
Blackboard and then whiteboard.

91
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,240
Then there’s a table.

92
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,192
If you noticed,

93
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,843
From season 1 to season 2,

94
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:50,538
There are new graffiti designs and decals.

95
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,836
The one I noticed the most is this.

96
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,130
The “Section E.”

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,589
Oh, I didn’t notice that.

98
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,729
You didn’t?

99
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:04,429
If you haven’t noticed, our lockers here

100
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,348
really changed.

101
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,449
Oh yes!

102
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,268
Even the designs.

103
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,894
The stickers.

104
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:18,209
If you remember the
scene at the christmas party

105
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,069
The lockers have changed.

106
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,196
For Keifer... where is it?

107
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,471
It’s here.

108
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,741
He moved.

109
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,578
So Mark Keifer Watson
with a skull and an “A.”

110
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,206
Guess what that “A” means.

111
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,283
Andres.

112
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:34,851
Yes.

113
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,171
It took a few months
before we came back here.

114
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,091
And they had to redo
everything from scratch.

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,761
Amazing right?

116
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,472
Which is very hard to do because

117
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,874
they had to copy the layout of season one.

118
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,314
But it’s a plus that

119
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:56,381
even though there are new decals
and many new things

120
00:05:56,654 --> 00:06:02,369
the same themes and
concepts are still present.

121
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,376
I hope you guys enjoyed our set tour.

122
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,044
Yes. And,

123
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,797
I hope you guys enjoyed
the set tour

124
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,964
of Section E.

125
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,009
This was our last day here for part one.

126
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:25,885
For part one.

127
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,971
Because we’re coming back for part two.

128
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,433
So please watch out for part two.

129
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,526
You know, I’m happy but it’s like
a new experience again for me,

130
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,444
like I’m getting to know Jay-jay again.

131
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,072
For every scene we’re taking, it’s like

132
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,075
I’m still just “acting” Jay-jay.

133
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,493
Where are you going? You’re not done yet.

134
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,120
So eager to go home?

135
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,037
Yeah. I'm ready.

136
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,288
And I feel great.

137
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
I’m done. I’m going home.

138
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,253
He’s embodying this nonchalant persona
from our workshop.

139
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,296
It’s our way to-

140
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,524
He cares.

141
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,608
I do.

142
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,872
So watch out.

143
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,263
Dark side.

144
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,114
Okay guys.

145
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,833
It’s our first day.

146
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,185
And we’re in our room.

147
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,854
I joined them here.

148
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,455
Dark side!

149
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,065
The dark side.

150
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,909
The dark side.

151
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,533
Poor Frost.

152
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,202
The only one who’s awake.

153
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,247
Good morning. I actually just woke up.

154
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,707
Oh I know why he’s awake.

155
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,933
Why?

156
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,418
There’s no place to sleep here.

157
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,413
Sam Shoaf took my spot guys!

158
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,288
You know, Ashtine told me that

159
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:45,423
I should sleep there but-

160
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,885
I told him, “bro take that spot
and make that your bed”

161
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,636
because he didn’t bring a taping chair.

162
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:51,579
I told him to take it.

163
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,156
He said, “okay, later.”

164
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,640
There, Sam Shoaf beat him to it.

165
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,934
But Ashtine let me borrow her bed.

166
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,269
So I’m really thankful.

167
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,854
I’m well rested.

168
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,065
That was quick.

169
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,316
But I had a comfortable sleep.

170
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,068
So how do you feel for our first day?

171
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,529
I’m so happy. It feels good.

172
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,906
We’re taping again.

173
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,116
But it’s exhausting.

174
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,618
I’m exhausted because

175
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,999
we’re waiting for so long.

176
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:15,887
Director.

177
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,663
- Actually
- Take us, Director.

178
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,415
Later. We’re all going home together.

179
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,375
They’re really gonna leave me?

180
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:25,087
But really, it’s more tiring to wait.

181
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,215
- Actually... oh wait>
- For the right person.

182
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,341
Oh, she’s sending a message.

183
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,992
No, I’m referring to work.

184
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,278
Really?

185
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,195
Yeah.

186
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,663
It’s exhausting to- nevermind, goodbye.

187
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,352
Okay, guys.

188
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,413
So, we’re back in our house.

189
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,981
I’m actually just a house guest but

190
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:48,753
I had the nerve to bring a plus one here.

191
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,921
So shameless.

192
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,989
I’m gonna show you my room.

193
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,716
It’s a new room.

194
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,972
It’s renovated.

195
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,039
New look for a new life.

196
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,257
So your position will be like this.

197
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:14,695
Hey, Ci-N! Come back!

198
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,905
Let’s go here.

199
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,516
But let’s keep it down
because they’re setting up.

200
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,395
Hi, Director!
Say Hi to my org mate.

201
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,357
We’re the same age.

202
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,527
We ran into each other at school
and we’re like, “oh we’re workmates!”

203
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,962
Amazing.

204
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,463
Nice to work with you, org mate.

205
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,448
Yes, I’m so happy that
I’m working with you right now.

206
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,624
And cut.

207
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,098
Let’s go there.

208
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,075
Our standby area is upstairs.

209
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,643
I’ll go get my things because

210
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,985
I’m done but they’re still making me work.

211
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,103
There, I’m going home

212
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,029
Let’s go downstairs.

213
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,781
Come with me downstairs.

214
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,491
Because I’m all alone.

215
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:10,776
Let’s go!

216
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,086
This is Mama R.

217
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,944
We’re not just having a room tour.

218
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,008
Okay let's go home.

219
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,427
So this is our very steep stairs.

220
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,872
It’s almost like a workout
when taking scenes here.

221
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:23,623
Cardio really.

222
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,500
Because it’s so high and we have to
go up and down.

223
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,319
And our standby area is upstairs.

224
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,564
And we’re shooting the scene here.

225
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,633
Oh, work out.

226
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,860
So we’re now at the living room.

227
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,108
Our living room?

228
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,991
I don’t know why we have so many sofa beds.

229
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:43,640
I don’t know.
There might be 20 people living here?

230
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,148
So many sofa, there’s two.

231
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,564
Okay.

232
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,318
So we’re in my standby area.

233
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,819
And I’m packing my things.

234
00:10:57,242 --> 00:11:00,245
I’m engaged so I shouldn’t
be thinking about Keifer.

235
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,719
My wife.

236
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,866
Bro!

237
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,174
Welcome back!

238
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:14,106
Okay guyS! That’s it for Ferenandez House.

239
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,342
So for our next location

240
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,443
watch out for it.

241
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,679
If you want to see it,
jus click “Like.”

242
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:22,429
If you don’t, just click “heart.” [sign]

243
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,978
Nonsense.

244
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:26,301
Bye!
