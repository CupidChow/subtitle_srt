More than a week
has passed, but...

184
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,667
we continue to pray

185
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:11,233

the good-hearted...

187
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,733
As we know, it is also our
responsibility as parents

188
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:24,133
to watch over and nurture our
children's mental well-being.

189
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,400
We all need to work together
to protect our children

190
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,400
and ensure that
this doesn't happen again...

191

...in or out of the campus.

192
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,167
Basic first step is to ensure

193
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:42,700
that the communication lines
within the family are open.

194
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,600
It's difficult,
but it's a must.

195

We have installed more
CCTV cameras in the campus.

196
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,067
We have also established
new emergency hotlines

197
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,867

Northford students

198
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,267

no longer acceptable.
