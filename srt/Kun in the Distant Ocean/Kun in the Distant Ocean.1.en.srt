1
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,370
Sister.

2
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,370
Listen to me.

3
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,870
Marrying Sea God

4
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,080
is just a beautiful illusion
from the legends.

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,410
Even if it comes true,

6
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,160
you have to pay a price.

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,330
If I don't venture there,

8
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,660
how can I become the Queen?

9
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,040
It's said that the Sea God's bride, Li,

10
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,500
is over two hundred years old.

11
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,290
She still looks like a young lady.

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,160
If I am chosen
as the Sea God's bride this time,

13
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,290
I can also stay young in the future.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,910
The two of us

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,000
can stay forever young.

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,540
How wonderful that would be.

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,450
Sister.

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,700
How about this?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,290
Let's go find
the giant goldfish together.

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,540
One piece of golden scale

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,790
from the giant goldfish is so powerful.

22
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,290
It can surely grant your wish.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,120
What I wish for

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,910
is to be the Queen

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,540
and to stay forever young.

26
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,080
That is beyond your understanding.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,950
It's the big fish.

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,000
The big fish has come
to welcome the bride.

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,160
It's here.

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,950
The big fish is here.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
It's the big fish, look.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,870
That's great.

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,540
That's great.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,330
Sister.

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,090
[Kun In the Distant Ocean]

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,700
Sister.

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,790
Sister.

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,910
Sister.

39
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,290
Come.

40
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,830
Are you alright?

41
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,120
I'm fine.

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,500
Where are we?

43
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,080
It's so bleak

44
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,370
and terrifying.

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,870
There are so many
brides in ice coffins here.

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,540
We won't also be sealed

47
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,660
in these ice coffins?

48
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,000
Everyone.

49
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,620
Listen to me.

50
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,290
Panicking is of no use.

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,540
We can't just wait for death.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,410
Let's find

53
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,290
a solution.

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,790
Look around for a way out.

55
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,580
Who is it?

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,410
Why are you hiding in the dark?

57
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,120
Don't be afraid.

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,290
I mean no harm.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
I know I am ugly.

60
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,660
If I have offended you,

61
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,790
I ask for your forgiveness.

62
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,000
If you mean no harm,

63
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,660
why are you hiding in the dark?

64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,750
Why didn't these brides in ice coffins

65
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,080
close their eyes?

66
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,410
The fate of mortal ladies
differs from that of Sea Gods.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
Unlike Sea God King Yan,

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
ordinary sea gods cannot prolong

69
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,620
the life of their kin.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,250
They can only place
these ladies in ice coffins

71
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,330
to preserve their beauty.

72
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,910
Are you the Sea God selecting a bride?

73
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,000
I am the Sea God's nephew.

74
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,290
My name is Xuan.

75
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,080
This time, we are selecting the Queen

76
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,500
for Prince Jin, the son of the Sea God.

77
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,160
Of course.

78
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,580
Contrary to me,

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,500
he is quite handsome and charming.

80
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,540
If you are unwilling to stay here,

81
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,410
I will have someone send you home.

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,700
If you are willing to meet Prince Jin,

83
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,450
you can follow me.

84
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,750
We've already come here today.

85
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,330
We must meet Prince Jin.

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,540
Right.

87
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,120
We want to meet Prince Jin.

88
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,080
Sister.

89
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,540
What a woman seeks in life

90
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,080
is to marry an ideal man.

91
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,160
Being frightened is no big deal.

92
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's become the Crown Princess

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,330
and be together forever.

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,950
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

95
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,160
Sister.

96
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,160
You know very well

97
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,620
that I have never wanted
to be the Crown Princess.

98
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,330
I want to find the giant goldfish.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,700
That's right!

100
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,200
Have you ever seen a giant goldfish?

101
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,330
Its size changes dramatically.

102
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,660
It's capable of flying.

103
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,790
It is red-tailed golden fish.

104
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,620
Red-tailed golden fish.

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,500
I believe I have seen

106
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,540
this giant goldfish.

107
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,120
It must be on Sea God Island.

108
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,370
However, I can't recall at the moment.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,750
At present,

110
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,450
I will take them
to see Prince Jin first.

111
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,950
When I return,

112
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,040
I will take you to find
the giant goldfish.

113
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,580
Okay.

114
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,950
Sister,

115
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,330
you must be extra careful.

116
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,660
Sister, rest assured.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,580
I will certainly stand out.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,450
When I become the Crown Princess

119
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,080
and if you haven't found
the giant goldfish by then,

120
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,700
I will surely have the Crown Prince
accompany you to find it.

121
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,330
Ladies.

122
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,790
Please follow me.

123
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,790
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

124
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,120
Sister.

125
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,200
Finally, I can go out and have fun.

126
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,000
Your Highness.

127
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,500
It's a barrier again.

128
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,620
Your Highness.

129
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,040
The four Elders said

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,580
if you finish today's lessons,

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,910
the barrier will be removed.

132
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,200
Then it will take another four hours.

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,080
This barrier is extraordinary.

134
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,370
It's only effective to your Highness.

135
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,950
If you forced your way through,

136
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,870
you would wait for another four hours.

137
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,160
Jin.

138
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:49,950
Jin.

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,200
Brother.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,160
Brother, you've returned.

141
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,450
I heard you went to Qi Yu.

142
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,950
Any fun stories?

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,830
Tell me.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
I brought you gifts.

145
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,950
What gifts?

146
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,870
Come.

147
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,950
Come.

148
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,950
Greetings, Your Highness.

149
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
Brother.

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,830
You've reached the age to get married.

151
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,450
All these ladies are stunning.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
I will leave you to it.

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,830
Wait, Brother.

154
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,370
I haven't planned to get married yet.

155
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,750
You should send them back, Brother.

156
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,620
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

157
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,660
Your Highness.

158
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,750
Now that I think about it,

159
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,870
we have been married
for two hundred years.

160
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,790
It's just a pity

161
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,830
that I won't be able to see

162
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,290
Jin take the throne of the Sea God.

163
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,410
That won't happen, Li.

164
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,410
Even if a thousand years pass,

165
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,790
we will still stay together.

166
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,040
Li.

167
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,080
Li.

168
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,870
After I leave,

169
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,620
you must

170
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,870
ensure that Jin retrieves
the soul of Kun

171
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,450
and keep him safe.

172
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,500
Li.

173
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,330
Li.

174
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,370
Li.

175
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,330
I won't let you die.

176
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,200
I swear.

177
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,540
Even if it means

178
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,660
defying the fate,

179
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,620
I won't let you die.

180
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,200
Sister.

181
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,250
Prince Xuan.

182
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,040
Where is my sister?

183
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,410
Since you're worried about her,

184
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,410
I'll accompany you
to the Crown Prince's palace,

185
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,160
so you can see your sister is safe.

186
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,580
Let's go.

187
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,160
By the way,

188
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,250
do you remember
where the giant goldfish is now?

189
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,370
Lingyu.

190
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,950
This Sea God Island

191
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,000
is home to many divine beasts.

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,290
I need to think it over.

193
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,910
But rest assured,

194
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,160
I must have seen the giant goldfish

195
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,120
you mentioned.

196
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:06,700
By the way,

197
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,160
how did you come to know
the giant goldfish?

198
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,580
Ten years ago,

199
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,410
I saved an injured little goldfish.

200
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
We made a promise to each other

201
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,120
to meet up again

202
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,200
when his injury has healed.

203
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,250
But ten years have passed.

204
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,040
I have never seen him again.

205
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,910
Okay.

206
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,540
Then I will accompany you

207
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,660
to find the giant goldfish tomorrow.

208
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,290
That would be nice.

209
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,580
Let's go.

210
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,370
Don't run away!

211
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,700
Your Highness, where are you going?

212
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,700
Your Highness.

213
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,700
Don't chase after me.

214
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,580
Your Highness.

215
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,040
Stop.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,790
Jin.

217
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,870
Finally, it's quiet.

218
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,620
Jin.

219
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,700
Brother.

220
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,540
Jin.

221
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,200
Sister.

222
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,120
Is everything alright?

223
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,500
Please help me out of this, Brother.

224
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,410
Sister.

225
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,620
What have you done to my sister?

226
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,910
She sounds so familiar,

227
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,040
and she looks familiar as well.

228
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,040
Who are you?

229
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,830
I am Lingyu from Qi Yu.

230
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,750
They've come for marrying the Sea God.

231
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,290
Why did you treat them this way?

232
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,580
You've misunderstood.

233
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,790
I merely used a freezing spell.

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
I will lift it now.

235
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,660
Why can't she wake up?

236
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,080
- What is going on?
- What happened?

237
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,500
Why have their spells all been lifted?

238
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,580
But why can't my sister wake up?

239
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,000
I only cast a freezing spell.

240
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,200
Lingyu.

241
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,080
You don't need to worry.

242
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,120
I will go find my father.

243
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,500
Father can use the power of the Sea God

244
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,450
to save your sister.

245
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,330
Sister, rest assured.

246
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,950
I will take you home.

247
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,500
Sister.

248
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,120
Can you hear me?

249
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,410
Sister.

250
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,790
Under a freezing spell,

251
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,410
one will surely lose consciousness.

252
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,040
How can she, a mere mortal lady,

253
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,450
still be able to react?

254
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,580
You saved my life.

255
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,700
So I'll give you a piece
of golden scale in return.

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,540
So she is that little girl from Qi Yu.

257
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,580
Lingyu.

258
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,000
You don't need to worry.

259
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,950
I will go to my father now.

260
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,410
Father, Mother.

261
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,290
Father, Mother.

262
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,370
Your Highness.

263
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,500
The Sea God and the Queen
have entered the Ice Palace.

264
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,500
Father and Mother
have gone to the Ice Palace?

265
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,660
What are they doing there?

266
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,200
I cannot say much about it.

267
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,910
Your Highness will understand
once you go there.

268
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,080
Alright.

269
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,250
Let's go.

270
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,500
Father.

271
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,660
Mother.

272
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,250
Jin, you must not exhaust your soul.

273
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,700
Your mother has been poisoned
for some unknown reason.

274
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,620
Her life is hanging by a thread.

275
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,950
I must stay here
to prolong your mother's life.

276
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,580
You must

277
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,700
head to the Black Snake Forest,

278
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,660
find the Old Queen,

279
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,910
retrieve the soul of Kun,

280
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,160
and become a true God
as soon as possible.

281
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,370
Then you will join me
in saving your mother.

282
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,410
But how can I retrieve the soul of Kun?

283
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,160
The soul of Kun shares
a telepathic bond with you.

284
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,290
It will recognize its master
within a hundred zhang.

285
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,790
Then I will leave at once.

286
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,700
Wait.

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,120
This protective seal

288
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,410
is forged from the essence
of generations of Kuns.

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,250
Whenever and wherever,

290
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,950
it can ensure your safety.

291
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,410
Although the journey
is fraught with danger,

292
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,450
you may venture forth.

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
Thank you, Father.

294
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,370
We, the townspeople of Qi Yu,

295
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,790
have worshiped the Sea God
since childhood.

296
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,500
Now, my sister Linghe is in danger,

297
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,450
I implore the Sea God to save my sister.

298
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,040
Miss.

299
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,200
The Sea God has held his breath.

300
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,870
He can no longer hear you.

301
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,120
Then I implore the Elders
to save my sister.

302
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,290
We are ordered to secure
His Majesty's safety here.

303
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,540
We have no time
to attend to other matters.

304
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,200
The Crown Prince will take you
to seek help from King Jing.

305
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,410
But Elder…

306
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,290
Lingyu.

307
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,160
Rest assured,

308
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,250
my uncle can surely save your sister.

309
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,950
Father.

310
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,330
Uncle, Brother.

311
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,700
Jin.

312
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,200
You are descended
from a royal line of the Sea God.

313
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,660
As you lost the soul of Kun,

314
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,950
you're unable
to control your spiritual power.

315
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,250
Xuan and I are merely big fish.

316
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm afraid we are powerless
against the royal spell.

317
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,040
Now we can only prolong
the lady's life with ice sealing.

318
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,580
Please, I'm begging you
to save my sister.

319
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,700
I must

320
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,700
head to the Black Snake Forest

321
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,290
and retrieve the soul of Kun

322
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,500
to resolve the current predicament.

323
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,700
Black Snake Forest?

324
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,540
Father.

325
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,200
I want to accompany my brother there.

326
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,750
Okay, Xuan.

327
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,370
You must protect Jin well.

328
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,870
Then I will also go with you.

329
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,290
As a mortal lady,

330
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,870
you need not take risks with us.

331
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,290
I have been protected
by spiritual power since childhood.

332
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,450
I can ensure my own safety
even in dangerous situations.

333
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,910
My spiritual power can also
protect those around me

334
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,330
within a range of one zhang.

335
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,540
I won't hold you back.

336
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,370
Alright,

337
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,950
we will go
to the Black Snake Forest together.

338
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,910
Step back.

339
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,540
You have finally arrived.

340
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,290
I have underestimated you.

341
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,580
As the Crown Prince,
you do have the courage.

342
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,580
Old Queen,

343
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,290
return the soul of Kun to my brother.

344
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,540
Grandmother,

345
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,250
please return the soul of Kun to me.

346
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,410
Since I've taken it away,

347
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,500
I won't easily give it back.

348
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Grandmother.

349
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,160
Father said you have raised him

350
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,160
and you did all these for his sake.

351
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
But why did you change a lot

352
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,790
and take away my soul of Kun?

353
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,580
How dare you question me?

354
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,910
I don't need

355
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,830
to explain what I did.

356
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,910
I have always respected you.

357
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,750
If you return my soul of Kun,

358
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,620
I will lift the nine seals for you

359
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
and set you free.

360
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,370
Okay.

361
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,660
Go back and tell your father

362
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,080
to make me take the Sea God's throne.

363
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,160
Only then will I restore
your soul of Kun.

364
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,200
Grandmother,

365
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,910
the Sea God's throne shall be
taken by the Great Kun.

366
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,450
Father can revitalize the Sea God clan.

367
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,040
You should discard this thought.

368
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,580
Your father

369
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,250
is kind-hearted and lenient,

370
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,250
lacking the decisiveness of a king.

371
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,580
The only one who can revitalize
the Sea God clan

372
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,580
is me.

373
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,330
Since we can't reach an agreement,

374
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,660
let's see if you can

375
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,200
escape from my black snake today.

376
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,870
Giant Goldfish.

377
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,790
He is the giant goldfish
I've been looking for.

378
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,330
Are you okay?

379
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,830
I am fine.

380
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,910
It was her.

381
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,330
Grandmother,

382
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,040
return my soul of Kun.

383
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,290
The soul of Kun

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,290
may have already become
another's immortal heart.

385
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,410
If you want to retrieve the soul of Kun,

386
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,000
someone will die here today.

387
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,790
I am descended
from a royal line of the Sea God.

388
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,500
No matter where I am,

389
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,330
I will not harm another's life.

390
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,870
I don't believe you are so unselfish.

391
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,580
The soul of Kun
is right in front of you.

392
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,330
Go get it yourself.

393
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,870
Grandmother.

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
You saved my life.

395
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
So I'll give you a piece
of golden scale in return.

396
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,450
Jin, I want to tell you something.

397
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,040
Grandmother didn't
hand over the soul of Kun.

398
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,660
The soul of Kun also did not
recognize its master either.

399
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,700
We must go to see my father first.

400
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,040
If you have any issues,

401
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,580
let's talk when we're safe.

402
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,200
Father.

403
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,450
I have returned safely
from the Black Snake Forest.

404
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,000
You said the soul of Kun would recognize
its master within a hundred zhang.

405
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,250
Why did I return empty-handed?

406
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,580
Was the soul of Kun
not in the Black Snake Forest?

407
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,790
Jin.

408
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,700
It must be hidden in a mortal.

409
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,950
A mortal?

410
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,330
How can a mortal body withstand
the power of the soul of Kun?

411
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,120
Our Sea God's royal female kun

412
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,540
is naturally infertile.

413
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,870
Thus, the soul of Kun must be hidden
in a mortal lady.

414
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,580
If the soul of Kun is placed
in a mortal lady,

415
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,410
the soul of Kun would
think it is a fetus

416
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,870
inside the womb

417
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,160
and will not seek its master.

418
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,080
A mortal lady.

419
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,620
Jin.

420
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,370
You must practice your skills diligently

421
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,950
and return to the Black Snake Forest

422
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,500
to force the Old Queen to reveal
the whereabouts of the soul of Kun.

423
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,000
In this way, you can become a true God.

424
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,580
We will then join forces
to save your mother.

425
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,870
I will work on my powers diligently.

426
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,450
Lingyu.

427
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,290
Lingyu.

428
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,000
Father.

429
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,750
Xuan.

430
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:26,950
Father.

431
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,790
How did it go?

432
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,540
Lingyu has the soul of Kun.

433
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,290
How can this be?

434
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,790
Today, in the Black Snake Forest,

435
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,200
I fiercely fought the Old Queen.

436
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,750
When Lingyu asked me
to find the giant goldfish,

437
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,580
I thought they have shared a history

438
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,790
that we could exploit,

439
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,830
so I cast a secret spell on Linghe

440
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,500
to prevent Jin from lifting
her freezing spell,

441
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,200
and keep Lingyu behind.

442
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,080
Unexpectedly,

443
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,200
she turned out to bear the soul of Kun.

444
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,040
Truly a pleasant surprise.

445
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,120
Who would have thought

446
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,790
these two sisters had such
a deep connection with Jin?

447
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,450
Don't forget

448
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,200
that her sister holds the golden scales

449
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,200
and she's under our control.

450
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,120
Are you feeling better?

451
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,540
Hey,

452
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,250
you risked your life to save me
in the Black Snake Forest.

453
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,370
I never had the time to ask you

454
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,290
how you managed to break free

455
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,540
from the Old Queen's clutches.

456
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,080
I just felt

457
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,700
my heart beating so strongly

458
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,580
as if it was about to burst out.

459
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,370
And then,

460
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,250
I saw the Old Queen get knocked away.

461
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,700
I was weak and dizzy

462
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,370
at that moment.

463
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,830
You said you have been protected
by spiritual power since childhood.

464
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,120
Did you have a mystical encounter

465
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,290
or were you born with it?

466
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,200
I was born with a heart defect

467
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,700
and I have been sickly since childhood.

468
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,450
And once, I was on the brink of death.

469
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,330
We sought after all great physicians,
but none could cure me.

470
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,200
Until one day...

471
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,040
Do you still remember

472
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,290
the time when that happened?

473
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,000
About ten years ago.

474
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,370
The year I turned six.

475
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,080
Ten years ago.

476
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,450
That's when I lost the soul of Kun.

477
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,250
The soul of Kun

478
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,620
may have already become
another's immortal heart.

479
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,000
Our Sea God's royal female Kun

480
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,370
is naturally infertile.

481
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,500
Thus,

482
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,790
the soul of Kun must be hidden
in a mortal lady.

483
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,080
Unexpectedly, it is actually in your…

484
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,250
What's wrong, Jin?

485
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm fine.

486
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,830
However, I've always been curious.

487
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,790
That year when I was six,

488
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,330
what exactly did

489
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,540
the lady in black put in my body?

490
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,910
Why is it that whenever I'm in danger,

491
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,830
the spiritual power
will always protect me?

492
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,160
Maybe you've been smart
since you were little,

493
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,040
and it's a gift bestowed
upon you by the Gods.

494
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,700
Right, Jin.

495
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,540
There's something I need to tell you.

496
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,450
Do you know

497
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,660
that you are…

498
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,250
Jin.

499
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,410
Jin.

500
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,830
Brother.

501
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
What are you doing here?

502
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,700
I'm here

503
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,040
to tell you some good news.

504
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,290
Father and I

505
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,200
have been transferring spiritual power
into Lady Linghe every day.

506
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,290
It looks like

507
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,370
she will wake up soon.

508
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,160
Let's go see my sister now.

509
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,540
Uncle.

510
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,790
Uncle, you've worked hard.

511
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,160
Please go back and rest.

512
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,620
Sister.

513
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,160
Sister, please wake up.

514
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,500
I am Lingyu.

515
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,830
I've come to see you.

516
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,120
Sister.

517
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,580
Before, my sister could blink her eyes,

518
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,580
but why is there no response now?

519
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,540
Lingyu.

520
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,910
Don't worry.

521
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,580
Uncle will be able to help your sister.

522
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,830
I have something to tell you.

523
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,080
What is it?

524
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,830
Ten years ago, I sneaked out

525
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,000
and was ambushed by the Old Queen.

526
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,370
So I lost my soul of Kun.

527
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,450
To preserve
my remaining spiritual power,

528
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,120
I turned into a little goldfish

529
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,000
and were stranded at the shore.

530
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,250
A girl saved me.

531
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,250
Little goldfish, you're hurt.

532
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,250
I'll take you home.

533
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,620
I didn't expect to see her again

534
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,120
after ten years.

535
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,870
Do you know who that girl is?

536
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,790
She is your sister,

537
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,660
Linghe.

538
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,660
My sister?

539
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,870
Did you say my sister saved you?

540
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,830
I was quite surprised at that time.

541
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,750
Ten years have passed

542
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,370
and we are able to meet again.

543
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,160
It must be fate.

544
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,040
So rest assured,

545
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,000
I will definitely save your sister

546
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,040
to repay her for saving my life.

547
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,120
How do you know it was my sister,

548
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,500
not someone else?

549
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,790
Ten years ago,

550
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,660
your sister saved me.

551
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,870
I had recuperated by her side
for seven days.

552
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,410
Before leaving,
I gave her a piece of golden scale.

553
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,450
It is the one on your sister's neck.

554
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,540
That is…

555
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,620
Sister.

556
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,870
Sister, you're awake.

557
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,540
Come here.

558
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,040
How are you?

559
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,910
Are you okay?

560
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,290
Are you injured?

561
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,450
All thanks to King Jing and Xuan,

562
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,750
who have been transferring
spiritual power to me every day,

563
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,870
I was able to wake up.

564
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,580
We should thank them.

565
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,500
Linghe.

566
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,910
Do you remember

567
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,540
you saved a small goldfish
ten years ago?

568
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,330
Are you the giant goldfish?

569
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,000
This is the token
of the Sea God's royal family.

570
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,790
Whoever comes with a golden scale

571
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,330
shall have their request granted.

572
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,330
Is that true?

573
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,660
A god's promise is never broken.

574
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Alright then,

575
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,580
I want you to marry me.

576
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,200
As for me,

577
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,950
I shall become the crown princess.

578
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,870
Whoever comes with a golden scale

579
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,290
shall have their request granted.

580
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,290
Jin,

581
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,370
this is indeed the promise
of the Sea God's royal family.

582
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,370
Then,

583
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,120
let's get married.

584
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,080
Sister.

585
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,660
My wish has finally been fulfilled.

586
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
You should be happy for me.

587
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,080
Right.

588
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,950
Your wish has been fulfilled.

589
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,910
I'm happy for you.

590
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,330
You saved my life. So I'll give you
a piece of golden scale in return.

591
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,370
The giant goldfish.

592
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,450
Lingyu.

593
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,250
Lingyu.

594
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,120
Why are you crying?

595
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,450
I am happy

596
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,500
that you will

597
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,870
marry my sister tomorrow.

598
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,000
Your Highness,

599
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,580
what brings you here?

600
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,540
Tomorrow is our wedding day.

601
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,830
I don't know why

602
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,910
I'm feeling anxious.

603
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,450
Lingyu, I…

604
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,450
I came here

605
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,870
to give you something.

606
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,580
This is a spirula shell.

607
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,790
I hope it can protect you.

608
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,830
Your Highness,

609
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,750
you will get married tomorrow.

610
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,120
Please do not overstep the line.

611
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,830
Indeed.

612
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,250
I will get married tomorrow.

613
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,450
I hope Your Highness

614
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,750
can treat my sister well

615
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,370
after marrying her.

616
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,580
That's all I wish for.

617
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,620
Lingyu.

618
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,250
I hesitate to say something.

619
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,370
Please say it, Your Highness.

620
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,410
When I first met you,

621
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,580
I felt you look familiar.

622
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,200
You also sound familiar.

623
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,700
You will marry my sister tomorrow,

624
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,620
and we will be family.

625
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,950
Maybe it is also a fate.

626
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,540
That's why I look familiar.

627
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,540
Do you really want me
to marry your sister?

628
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,330
Of course.

629
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,160
My sister's greatest wish

630
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,000
is to become the Sea God's bride.

631
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,660
Now her wish has come true.

632
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,040
I hope both of you will be happy.

633
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
Wish you an auspicious

634
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,000
and joyful…

635
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,540
joyful marriage.

636
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,200
Once I marry your sister,

637
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,410
you will become my sister-in-law.

638
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,950
That's good.

639
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,410
I have waited for you for a long time.

640
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,120
You've finally returned.

641
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,580
Tomorrow is our wedding day.

642
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,580
Those ladies from Qi Yu who came with me

643
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,120
are still in the ice palace.

644
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,790
They have asked Prince Xuan

645
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,330
to freeze them for a hundred days

646
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,040
so as to preserve their beauty.

647
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,910
Before our wedding,
let's go check on them

648
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,700
with my sister.

649
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,250
They are all my sisters.

650
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,700
You must help me unfreeze them,

651
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,450
so they can attend our wedding ceremony.

652
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,660
Sure.

653
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,200
The giant goldfish.

654
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:43,950
What?

655
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,790
Why do you call me that?

656
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,290
Actually, I was the one
who saved you ten years ago.

657
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,290
I gave this piece of golden scale

658
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,950
to my sister for protecting her.

659
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,870
So you were the girl who saved me.

660
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,700
No wonder you look so familiar.

661
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,790
The giant goldfish,

662
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,950
tell me,

663
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,950
how can I save you now?

664
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,950
Go find my uncle and brother.

665
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,040
Okay.

666
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,290
You don't need to find us.

667
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,290
We have arrived.

668
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,200
Uncle, Brother.

669
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,790
Please, save the Giant Goldfish.

670
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,290
Rest assured.

671
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,250
I will cast a spell on him

672
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,160
and send him a place far away

673
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,500
where he'll be trapped.

674
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,750
Why are you doing this?

675
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,700
As you told me the story

676
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,910
of the Giant Goldfish at first,

677
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,620
I intentionally kept you

678
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,200
and your sister behind.

679
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,410
Although I couldn't
take advantage of you,

680
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,750
but it's a good move

681
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,750
to take advantage
of your sister instead.

682
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,330
Why have their spells all been lifted?

683
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,910
But why can't my sister wake up?

684
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,200
So it was my fault.

685
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,120
No.

686
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,580
It's not your fault.

687
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,200
Jin, don't blame me for being heartless.

688
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,830
But there can only be one Sea God King.

689
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,660
And that would be my son Xuan.

690
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,290
So you have to spend

691
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,620
your remaining life
at the Soul Devouring pond.

692
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,000
No, no!

693
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,040
Please, I beg you!

694
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,040
Please don't harm him.

695
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,160
I will do anything.

696
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,200
Lingyu.

697
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,910
Keeping you behind

698
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,200
is indeed useful.

699
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,870
Because you have something

700
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,500
we want.

701
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,700
Lingyu.

702
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,290
Lingyu.

703
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,700
It is indeed a divine object.

704
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,330
That is extraordinary.

705
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,540
Xuan, join me

706
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,580
in retrieving the divine object.

707
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,450
Stop.

708
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,160
This lady is mine.

709
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,290
Old Queen.

710
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,290
How did you break
through the nine seals?

711
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,330
I must thank my grandson for that.

712
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,370
When he came to the Black Snake Forest,

713
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,500
he cracked the seal open

714
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,700
to make me regain my freedom.

715
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,870
Grandmother.

716
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,830
Old Queen.

717
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,410
I want to marry her.

718
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,000
You can't take her away.

719
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,120
Like I said,

720
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
she is mine.

721
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,250
There are many ladies in Qi Yu.

722
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,700
You may marry another one.

723
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,790
You…

724
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,200
Xuan.

725
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,620
She's just an ordinary lady.

726
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,660
If you like her,

727
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,120
you can take her away.

728
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,700
Grandmother.

729
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,250
You are not worthy
of taking the Sea God's throne.

730
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,330
Old Queen.

731
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,750
Only the capable may take
the Sea God's Throne.

732
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,370
Later on, my son and I
will pay our respects to you.

733
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,870
We hope to have your guidance.

734
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,290
Jin.

735
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,450
You and I share the bond of kinship.

736
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,250
My son and I cannot bear to kill you.

737
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,540
Just stay at this Soul Devouring Pond

738
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,200
forever.

739
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,080
Elder Jing.

740
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,040
Jin heard that the chilling aura
of the Soul Devouring Pond

741
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,950
is conducive

742
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,000
to cultivation,

743
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,000
so he went to the Soul Devouring Pond.

744
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,660
Unexpectedly, the Old Queen
broke through the seal

745
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,250
and pushed him down
into the Soul Devouring Pond.

746
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,000
Now his life is in danger.

747
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,830
Elder Xuan, Elder Ming.

748
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,620
Elder Gui.

749
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,250
You three must
go to the Soul Devouring Pond quickly,

750
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,290
dive into the pond
and rescue the Crown Prince.

751
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,330
Yes.

752
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,620
Form the array.

753
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,830
Prince Xuan.

754
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,620
Why did you try to hurt us?

755
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,830
If you three

756
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,160
pledge your loyalty to me,

757
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,250
I will spare your lives.

758
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,790
You traitors.

759
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,160
Don't even think about it.

760
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,080
I knew long ago that you are
loyal to the Sea God.

761
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,910
You shall go to the bottom
of the Soul Devouring pond

762
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,870
and be loyal to Jin.

763
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,120
King Jing.

764
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,040
The three elders are absent.

765
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,910
It's been a long time

766
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,750
since I sensed the Sea God's
spiritual consciousness.

767
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,290
Please join me in protecting him.

768
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,120
Okay.

769
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,370
I shall join you right now.

770
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,000
King Jing, do you wish to rebel?

771
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,700
You truly are clueless.

772
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,500
I have been planning it
for a hundred years,

773
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,120
yet none of you found out.

774
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,120
King Jing.

775
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,160
I only ask that you consider the fact

776
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,500
that the Sea God has always valued
you and your son

777
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,870
and spare his life.

778
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,700
My son and I have come
to pay respects to the Old Queen.

779
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,450
What brings you two here?

780
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,790
Old Queen.

781
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,250
My son is gravely injured.

782
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,950
We need the soul of Kun in Lingyu.

783
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,200
Please save him, Old Queen.

784
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,870
Since you are asking for my help,

785
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,750
I need to ask

786
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,870
what you will give me in return?

787
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,450
Xuan and I

788
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,790
are willing to help you
regain control of the Sea God Island.

789
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,700
King Jing.

790
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,700
Over the past hundred years,
your ambition has surged.

791
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,660
Yan is kind and benevolent,

792
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,160
so he didn't notice it.

793
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,000
But you couldn't deceive me.

794
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,580
Jin, however, does show some capability.

795
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,080
But being young and kind-hearted,

796
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,120
he can easily fall
into traps set by others.

797
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,410
So I am worried

798
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,580
that their kindness
will lead to their downfall,

799
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,040
which is why I reluctantly

800
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,290
vowed to reclaim
the throne of the Sea God.

801
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,250
Old Queen.

802
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,700
You are indeed far-sighted,

803
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,700
decisive and resolute in action.

804
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,120
With you in charge, the Sea God Island

805
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,040
will surely prosper.

806
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,950
I only ask that you hand Lingyu to Xuan.

807
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,870
Today, I give you the right to choose.

808
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,450
Do you want to live with Xuan

809
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,330
or die with Jin?

810
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,870
Old Queen.

811
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,120
What does that mean?

812
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,000
Why must I make such a choice?

813
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,620
Have you forgotten

814
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,000
that someone put something
in your body ten years ago?

815
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,160
Since then, you have been reborn.

816
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,580
How do you know that?

817
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,250
Could it be

818
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,500
that the god was you?

819
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,580
Indeed, it was me.

820
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,750
Ten years ago, you were
kind enough to save my life.

821
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,830
Now, I'm begging you

822
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,750
to save Prince Jin's life.

823
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,870
I have already given you the choice.

824
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,500
Even if it means death,

825
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,120
I want to die with Jin.

826
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:18,750
You…

827
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,500
Xuan.

828
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,160
Then you shall hand over the soul of Kun

829
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,120
and die with him.

830
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,450
The soul of Kun?

831
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,290
The soul of Kun is in me?

832
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,750
Ten years ago,

833
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,750
the thing you put in my body

834
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,370
is the soul of Kun?

835
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,040
I will ask you for the last time.

836
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,580
Live

837
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,250
with Xuan,

838
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,040
or die

839
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:43,950
with Jin?

840
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,580
The soul of Kun, if you are awake,

841
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,200
take me to follow your master.

842
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,910
Father, the soul of Kun.

843
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,540
The soul of Kun.

844
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,750
Your master is in danger
in the Soul Devouring Pond.

845
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,120
Make sure not to mistake your master.

846
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,000
It seems Jin has not misjudged you.

847
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,750
If so,

848
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,040
you shall follow Jin

849
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,750
in life and death.

850
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,000
Old Queen,

851
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,540
why are you helping her?

852
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,160
Are you breaking your promise?

853
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,080
You two harbor ill ambitions.

854
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,790
If you get the soul of Kun,

855
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,790
it will lead to the suffering
of all living beings.

856
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,450
This is an exchange.

857
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,040
We are the ones who can help you
regain control of Sea God Island.

858
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,000
How can a scoundrel's
promise be trusted?

859
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,370
Do you really think

860
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,040
I would sacrifice my grandson's life?

861
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,410
You are seeking death

862
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,830
as you broke the promise.

863
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
Hurry up and save the Old Queen.

864
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,080
Hurry up!

865
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,910
It's the roar of the Kun. It's Jin!

866
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,410
Jin has become a true God.

867
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:40,950
Today, you two

868
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,620
won't escape.

869
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,700
Stop!

870
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,830
Uncle, let my grandmother go.

871
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,200
Jin, don't worry about me!

872
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,660
These two have plotted to take
the throne of the Sea God.

873
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,750
Kill them both

874
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,950
to prevent future troubles.

875
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,000
Grandmother.

876
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,080
Don't worry about me.

877
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,160
I only wish for you to ascend
the Sea God's throne soon

878
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,120
and ensure eternal peace
of the Sea God Island.

879
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,830
Uncle, let my grandmother go.

880
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,450
Then I will spare your lives.

881
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,910
You just talk big.

882
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,330
Jin, take a look at who it is.

883
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,870
Brother, don't hurt her.

884
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,540
Fine.

885
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,250
If so,

886
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,700
take out your soul of Kun

887
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and hand it over to me.

888
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,870
Otherwise, even if it means death,

889
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,790
I will die with her.

890
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,790
We are both from the Sea God clan,

891
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,830
how can you bully a mortal lady

892
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,870
and threaten me with her life?

893
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,580
You are not deserved
to be a member of our clan.

894
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,330
Jin, would you like the life

895
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,370
of Old Queen and this mortal lady

896
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,910
in exchange for your soul of Kun?

897
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:01,540
Jin.

898
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,830
You must not hand over
the soul of Kun to them.

899
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,700
They have plotted for a hundred years.

900
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,040
If they obtain the soul of Kun,

901
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,410
Sea God Island will be beyond salvation.

902
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,120
Grandmother.

903
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,160
Jin.

904
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,910
Now, my sister and the Queen

905
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,370
are still waiting for our rescue.

906
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,370
If you hand over the soul of Kun,

907
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,080
all our efforts will have been in vain.

908
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,450
I see you can't bear
to use your Kun's soul

909
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,330
to save others.

910
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,620
In that case,

911
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,290
I will wipe them out.

912
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,120
The soul of Kun has long
become my immortal heart.

913
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,120
Now that I've lost it,

914
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,200
I will die soon.

915
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,330
You have become a true God now.

916
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,750
You must remember

917
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,700
to save my sister and the Queen.

918
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:45,870
Don't do that.

919
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,450
Fine, I agree with that.

920
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,620
I'll give you the soul of Kun.

921
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,500
But you must promise me

922
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,620
that once you're in charge
of Sea God Island,

923
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,580
you shall not harm any creatures.

924
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,290
Alright.

925
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,580
We will treat all creatures well.

926
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,540
Xuan.

927
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,080
You can finally become a true God.

928
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,120
Xuan.

929
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,500
Father.

930
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,370
Xuan.

931
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,500
Father.

932
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,620
Xuan.

933
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:13,950
Let's go.

934
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:18,700
Jin.

935
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,450
Thank you, Grandmother.

936
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm fine now.

937
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,870
Grandmother, please go back and rest.

938
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,410
Lingyu.

939
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,830
Lingyu.

940
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,160
Jin.

941
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,080
There's no need to waste
any more spiritual power.

942
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,290
Thanks to your soul of Kun,

943
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,950
I have been lucky enough
to live for ten more years.

944
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,080
As I face death now,

945
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,910
I am able to see you again.

946
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,330
I am already content.

947
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:14,450
No.

948
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,290
Lingyu.

949
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,250
Lingyu.

950
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,330
Jin.

951
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,080
Why did you do this?

952
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,790
This is the protective seal
from the Sea God King to you.

953
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,830
But you gave it to me.

954
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,450
If you encountered danger in the future,

955
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,290
what would you do then?

956
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,830
Aren't you the same?

957
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,120
You risked your life

958
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,580
to save me.

959
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,700
So that day in the Black Snake Forest,

960
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,950
you knew that I have the soul of Kun.

961
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,450
Did you not become a true God

962
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,250
because you were protecting me?

963
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,200
Ten years ago,

964
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,370
we came to know each other.

965
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,500
What has happened

966
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,250
means that we are connected.

967
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,200
Ten years later,

968
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,950
we are able to meet again.

969
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:19,910
But why

970
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,250
did you hand over the soul of Kun
to that bad guy?

971
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,120
He has been coveting
the Sea King's throne for a long time.

972
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,910
As long as every creature
is treated well,

973
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,750
it does not matter who

974
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,750
ascends the Sea God's throne.

975
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:36,500
Now,

976
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,660
compared to your life,

977
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,410
losing all this won't matter.

978
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,500
You may leave first.

979
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,750
Yes.

980
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,750
Lingyu.

981
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,290
Sister.

982
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,450
Are you alright?

983
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,830
Her eyes are dull.

984
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,000
I suspect she's been controlled by Jing.

985
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,250
I'm afraid Jing has other schemes.

986
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,540
So I brought her here.

987
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,580
Thank you, Old Queen.

988
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,910
Jin, how is it?

989
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,660
Grandmother, what brings you here?

990
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,290
How's your recovery?

991
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,660
I am fine.

992
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,500
I've come to see Yan.

993
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,000
Grandmother.

994
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,870
Most of Father's soul
has been taken away by King Jing.

995
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,250
Grandmother, please save him.

996
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,620
All along,

997
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,160
my spiritual consciousness
has been under King Jing's control.

998
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,500
Until just now,

999
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,580
the golden scale sensed
the soul of Kun in Xuan,

1000
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,000
which allowed me to awaken.

1001
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,790
Fortunately, King Jing
has not yet discovered it.

1002
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,080
But he took the golden scale.

1003
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:42,910
Jin.

1004
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,080
Let the guardians

1005
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,580
transfer spiritual power
into your father.

1006
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,200
You must find King Jing

1007
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,250
to take back the soul of Kun.

1008
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,120
The soul of Kun will recognize
its master within a hundred zhang.

1009
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,450
Grandmother.

1010
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,540
I don't want
to retrieve the soul of Kun.

1011
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,410
I fear it will only
lead to more slaughter.

1012
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:57,950
You fool.

1013
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,700
King Jing and his son
have ill intentions.

1014
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,160
They will only bring
misery to all living beings.

1015
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,450
Jin.

1016
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,450
Do you really think

1017
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,410
that anyone can possess the soul of Kun?

1018
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,120
It is your soul of Kun.

1019
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,290
It is not just the divine power
you were born with,

1020
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,330
but also your responsibility
you must bear

1021
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,750
as part of the Sea God's royal family.

1022
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,160
Grandmother, but I…

1023
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,830
Besides,

1024
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,870
with our current spiritual power,

1025
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,160
we can only keep your parents alive,

1026
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,200
but we cannot awaken them.

1027
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,370
Do you really bear

1028
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,120
to see them remain in slumber like this?

1029
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,870
Okay.

1030
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,040
Grandmother.

1031
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,540
I promise you

1032
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,290
that I'll go right away.

1033
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,450
The soul of Kun,

1034
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,290
your master has come
within a hundred zhang.

1035
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,330
Why don't you recognize your master?

1036
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,120
Why hasn't the soul of Kun
recognized its master yet?

1037
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,080
Jin.

1038
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,830
The soul of Kun is disturbed
by the spiritual power

1039
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,200
and will not recognize
the master on its own.

1040
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:44,910
Grandmother.

1041
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,330
Xuan.

1042
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:51,660
Xuan.

1043
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:04,200
After a decade of twists and turns,

1044
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,700
this is the token
of my first encounter with Jin.

1045
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,540
Jin.

1046
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,290
I beg you to spare Xuan's life.

1047
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:27,790
I am willing to take all the blame.

1048
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,200
It was all my scheme.

1049
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,370
Your mother was injured by me.

1050
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,330
It was all to make the Sea God King Yan

1051
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:34,370
follow her into the forbidden area

1052
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:35,500
and prolong her life.

1053
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,750
In this way, I can

1054
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,410
successfully take your soul of Kun.

1055
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,910
If you want to kill anyone,

1056
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,580
kill me.

1057
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,700
It has nothing to do with my father.

1058
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,750
Xuan.

1059
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,040
Jin.

1060
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,120
I know you care about family ties

1061
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,080
and can't bear to harm them.

1062
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,040
If so,

1063
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,330
let me do it for you.

1064
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:58,750
I will get rid of these two

1065
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,120
to prevent future troubles.

1066
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,290
Grandmother, show mercy.

1067
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,790
They are

1068
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,000
not irredeemably evil.

1069
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,620
They pushed me
down into the Soul Devouring Pond,

1070
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,870
but they did not kill me,

1071
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,450
which is why the soul of Kun
is restored today.

1072
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,250
You are kind-hearted.

1073
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,330
I believe

1074
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,540
that when you take over
the Sea God Island in the future,

1075
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,830
you will surely
protect all the creatures.

1076
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,120
Everything is karma.

1077
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,830
I am not as perceptive as you all.

1078
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,040
Uncle, Brother.

1079
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,200
You may keep your lives,

1080
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,160
but you will be punished.

1081
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,580
You shall reflect on your sins

1082
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,370
in the deep palace under the sea
for one hundred years.

1083
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,540
I accept the punishment.

1084
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,250
Thank you for showing mercy.

1085
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,500
Thank you, Brother.

1086
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,580
Thank you, Old Queen.

1087
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,250
Father.

1088
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,290
Jin.

1089
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:20,910
Your soul of Kun has been restored.

1090
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,580
My mother is here too.

1091
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:25,580
Father.

1092
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,330
Grandmother helped a lot.

1093
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:28,790
She saved me from predicaments.

1094
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,830
Otherwise, I would have long been dead.

1095
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Thank you for protecting Jin.

1096
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:41,250
Jin is my royal grandson.

1097
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,040
I will certainly protect him.

1098
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:46,790
Mother.

1099
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,950
Mother, you're awake.

1100
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:51,370
Father.

1101
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:52,910
Li, you're awake.

1102
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,500
I will never let you leave me again.

1103
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,790
Greetings, Mother.

1104
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,080
Mother, thank you

1105
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,040
for helping Jin
retrieve the soul of Kun.

1106
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,830
Li.

1107
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,370
No need for such formalities.

1108
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,080
Speaking of which,

1109
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,160
I owe everyone an explanation.

1110
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,160
Jin and Xuan
have been close since childhood,

1111
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,250
like brothers.

1112
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,660
Yet the King Jing and his son
have harbored ill ambitions

1113
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,870
and schemed for a century.

1114
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,870
I have warned you many times.

1115
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,870
But you always said

1116
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,410
"they are relatives,

1117
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,790
so you can't doubt them."

1118
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,290
Jin was young

1119
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,000
and had no guard against others.

1120
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,000
I took away his soul of Kun

1121
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,950
to test Jin

1122
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,160
and to protect it

1123
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:54,750
from being taken away.

1124
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,870
Mother, you have done so much.

1125
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,830
I feel truly ashamed.

1126
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,410
It's all in the past.

1127
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,120
Now, it is calm.

1128
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,120
I only wish that our family

1129
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:09,660
can live peacefully,

1130
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,830
without the estrangement.

1131
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,200
We will protect
the Sea God Island together.

1132
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:16,450
Me too.

1133
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,620
Sister, in the future,

1134
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,950
you should often come back to visit me.

1135
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,080
Sister, you're blessed

1136
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,910
as the Crown Princess.

1137
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,290
I am happy for you.

1138
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,330
I will surely come to visit you often.

1139
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,750
From now on, we cannot
see each other every day.

1140
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,040
This golden scale
can ensure a smooth life.

1141
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,910
No, I can't.

1142
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:06,830
Sister.

1143
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,330
I was naive back then

1144
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,120
and took your things.

1145
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,540
I've never properly taken care of you.

1146
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,410
This is a token given to you

1147
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,870
by Prince Jin.

1148
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,700
You should keep it with you.

1149
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:19,950
Sister,

1150
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:22,410
since Jin has given it to me,

1151
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,370
I can give it to you as a gift.

1152
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:25,660
This golden scale is a divine object.

1153
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,160
With it around you,

1154
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,330
I can rest easy too.

1155
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:12,160
Take care.

1156
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,700
Take care.

1157
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,700
From now on,

1158
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,830
I will always be with you.

1159
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:14,950
Lingyu.

1160
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,080
Wherever you want to go,
I will take you there.

1161
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,620
To the ends of the earth,
and all corners of the world,

1162
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:25,700
I want to show you
all the beautiful sights in this world.
