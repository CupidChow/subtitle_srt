1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:29,140


2
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:41,100
   

3
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,567
Say something, Kang Hee.

4
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,533
- I'm hungry. 
 - Huh?

5
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,700
I couldn't eat anything all day, so I'm hungry.

6
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,200
Try it.

7
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,100
What?

8
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,033
Do I look pathetic?

9
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:27,933
Are you all right?

10
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,500
Of course.

11
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,590
I'm a person who values cost-effectiveness,

12
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,960
so once I'm full, that's it.

13
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,500
If you don't eat, I'll eat it all.

14
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,667
Slow down.

15
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,667
If you're sad, just cry.

16
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,933
It's okay to cry.

17
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,767
I'm not sad.

18
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:33,800
It's because I feel sorry for Chun Pil.

19
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:44,167
He confessed that he had a terminal illness,

20
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,300
but his so-called daughter...

21
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,900
just kept eating, saying she's hungry.

22
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,733
This is the pollack roe that Chun Pil sent me.

23
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,500
Ah Reum brought it here, but actually,

24
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,167
Chun Pil is the one who sent it to me.

25
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,133
Gamtae seaweed,

26
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,067
frozen beef bone soup,

27
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,790
fist-sized diced radish kimchi, radish water kimchi,

28
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,360
he sent all of these to me.

29
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,133
He thinks I don't know, but…

30
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,133
I know everything.

31
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:27,100
Even though I knew, I pretended not to,

32
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,567
or rather, acted like it was nothing,

33
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,933
and never once thanked him.

34
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,300
How long does Chun Pil have?

35
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,433
Huh?

36
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,300
How long does Chun Pil have?

37
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,867
On graduation day,

38
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:39,533
Chun Pil wanted to take a photo with me, but I didn't…

39
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,833
I should have taken it.

40
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,600
He said he wanted to see how I live,

41
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,133
but I told him it wasn't possible…

42
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,700
I should have told him to come in.

43
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:10,167
I told him that I found it bothersome...

44
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:14,767
and didn't want to see him every Christmas.

45
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:17,367
When we meet,

46
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:20,333
he called me, saying, 'Kang Hee! Kang Hee!'

47
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,133
I was embarrassed by his loud voice,

48
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,733
and I didn't want to see that either.

49
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,940
I also hated seeing him come every year,

50
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,560
trying to look stylish by switching hats.

51
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,600
Chun Pil always seemed like

52
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,267
he would be a nuisance, constantly by my side, but…

53
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,033
what will I do if Chun Pil really dies, Yeon Soo?

54
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:03,433
That foolish Chun Pil,

55
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,967
he's such a scaredy-cat.

56
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,033
How frightened must he have been alone?

57
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,933
Please tell me that Chun Pil isn't dying because of me,

58
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,233
that he's not sick because of me.

59
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,833
It's not because of you.

60
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,933
Please tell me that...

61
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:41,533
Chun Pil won't die, leaving only me behind.

62
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,833
Teddy bear, why are you crying?

63
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,800
Please tell me that if something happens to Chun Pil,

64
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,267
you'll be by my side.

65
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Nothing will happen to him...

66
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,200
and I'll always be by your side.

67
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:30,020
♫  All my sunset-colored memories  ♫

68
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:38,820
♫  Are scattered, flying on that breeze ♫ 

69
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,220
♫  I, us, oh  ♫

70
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:59,380
♫   All my beautiful sunset-colored memories   ♫

71
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:08,260
♫  Go dark, submerged in that sea  ♫

72
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:20,000
♫   I don't know us   ♫

73
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,267
Why did you wake up? You should be sleeping deeply.

74
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:11,367
Let's go, I'll put you back to sleep.

75
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,433
When I left Hana-eup,

76
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:24,200
I promised myself I'd never live like Mr. Chun Pil.

77
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,950
But even on my day off from the construction site

78
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,530
with patches all over my body,

79
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:33,400
I still insisted on going to the movie theater to watch a film...

80
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,833
and to the museum to see the exhibition.

81
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:43,033
Even after I criticized him for it.

82
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,900
If you want to talk about him, I'll always listen, Kang Hee.

83
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,133
Even if I keep talking about him?

84
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,133
Sure.

85
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:56,800
I'll listen to you, even if you keep talking about him.

86
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,900
Even if I never saw him again in my life,

87
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,467
I thought I'd be okay.

88
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:12,567
Why do I regret the days I didn't see him?

89
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:13,867
Yeon Soo...

90
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,567
How long are you going to keep regretting?

91
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,933
You can see him from now on.

92
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,933
That's right.

93
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,900
Yeon Soo, by the way,

94
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,967
how do you always say the right thing every time?

95
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,900
Do you know the answer?

96
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,800
And how do you say things so nicely?

97
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,567
I can never think of what to say.

98
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:46,267
How about becoming a bit more simple?

99
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,267
When you live worrying about too many things,

100
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:53,867
you miss out on things.

101
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,933
I see.

102
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,867
All right.

103
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,933
Just simply.

104
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:45,033
Oh, it's our Seung Eon.

105
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:55,733
From now on, I'll be your guardian.

106
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,433
You want to be my guardian?

107
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,733
Seung Eon, there's somewhere I need to go with you.

108
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,567
I have somewhere to go.

109
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
It's this way.

110
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,433
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

111
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,567
I came to apply for adoption.

112
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,733
It's an adult adoption.

113
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,467
And I'm the adoptive father, and he's the adoptee.

114
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,933
Do you have a spouse?

115
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,200
No, I don't.

116
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,500
Then you need to fill out the paperwork first.

117
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,300
Hello.

118
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,900
It's all done, now.

119
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,700
Mister.

120
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:57,767
Let's go get some jjajangmyeon with Dad.

121
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,967
Huh?

122
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,700
   

123
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:34,133
Thank you for taking care of Chun Pil all this time.

124
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,967
I'm sorry.

125
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,800
It must have been tough handling it all by yourself, right?

126
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,467
The next time you don't tell me what's going on with him,

127
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,200
you're dead.

128
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,733
All right.

129
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,800
Where is Chun Pil?

130
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,500
He's resting.

131
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,133
Chun Pil, are you inside?

132
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,833
 Yes. 

133
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,233
What are you doing?

134
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,033
Oh, now?

135
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm trying to organize this and that.

136
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Why? Did the doctor say you're going to die?

137
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,267
Come on, even if the doctor doesn't tell me that, I know it.

138
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,833
Jeez!

139
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,900
All right, all right.

140
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,333
I feel good getting attention from you.

141
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,900
I should have told you earlier that I was in pain.

142
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,800
And I should've pretended to be a little sicker.

143
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:32,467
I heard chemotherapy is really tough.

144
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,400
I'll go with you some time.

145
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,867
Really?

146
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,800
Then take a number and wait.

147
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,700
There's a long line of people who want to go with me.

148
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,667
Just…

149
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,867
Just keep living as you normally do.

150
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,500
You live your life, and I'll live mine.

151
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
That's all you need to do.

152
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,667
Don't worry.

153
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,233
Don't act all high and mighty when you're the one who's sick.

154
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,167
If you want to date her, go ahead.

155
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,233
Who?

156
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,333
CEO Hwang Jeong Gu.

157
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,667
Oh, my.

158
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
That was funny.

159
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:35,633
Should I call her?

160
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,467
Finally, my daughter Kang Hee has permitted our relationship.

161
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,967
With a rose in my mouth, should I give her a call?

162
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,633
Oh, come on! It's annoying.

163
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,267
Chun Pil! Chun Pil—

164
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,067
Chun Pil!

165
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,733
Chun Pil.

166
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,967
Chun Pil, what do I do?

167
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:26,833
What will I do without you, Chun Pil?

168
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:32,233
You are like my real family.

169
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,600
It's okay. I'm not going to die right away.

170
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
Don't worry.

171
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,233
Oh, I'm… I'm Lee Mok Won.

172
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,600
I've heard a lot about you from Su Ji.

173
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,367
Yes, you are fashion president from Cheongwon, right?

174
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:47,833
I've heard about you indirectly, nice to meet you.

175
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,300
Chun Pil, what do I do?

176
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
May I call you brother?

177
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,367
Yes, as you wish.

178
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,700
Su Ji, have a talk and come out.

179
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,167
I'll get some fresh air outside.

180
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,167
Hey, sit down.

181
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,500
Hey, this is the first time I've seen someone

182
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,367
you've dated who actually has a proper business card.

183
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:22,733
Thank you very much, Su Ji.

184
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,967
Of course, you'd be thankful.

185
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:31,033
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

186
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,700
I mean, insurance!

187
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,933
I kept insisting that you get this insurance, and that insurance, remember?

188
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:39,033
You were so nice and listened to everything I said.

189
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,260
Yes, that's right, Su Ji.

190
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,300
Thanks to you, I don't have to worry about hospital bills.

191
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Oh no, why are you taking money from the insurance company?

192
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,567
You need to be healthy!

193
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:52,067
If something happens to you, I will follow right after you,

194
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,300
so take care of yourself.

195
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,133
All right, all right.

196
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
Ms. Hwang.

197
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,567
You should have informed us in advance.

198
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,900
Today, I'm not CEO Hwang from Golden Gilt,

199
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,100
but I've come as Chun Pil's hospital mate.

200
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:19,800
Shall we talk together?

201
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:29,167
Should I be mentally prepared?

202
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:33,267
Kang Hee, Korea's medical technology is top-notch.

203
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:37,000
If he has the will to live, he can get better.

204
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,967
I did, and so did Chun Pil.

205
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:43,533
He'll definitely overcome it this time as well.

206
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
Kang Hee,

207
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,900
I can continue being his hospital mate

208
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,360
without wondering what you think. Right?

209
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,900
Thank you, Ms. Hwang.

210
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,667
I'll continue to ask for your care and support for him.

211
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,233
Yeon Soo.

212
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,767
Shall I dry your hair?

213
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,167
- Yes. 
 - Then I'll dry your hair.

214
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,267
How can you dry it without fingers?

215
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,400
Like this.

216
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,667
Isn't it hot, sir?

217
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:30,133
It feels good. I wish you could dry my hair like this every day.

218
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:31,700
I'll dry it every day.

219
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,933
- Really? 
 - Yes.

220
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,333
Then next time, I'll dry your hair.

221
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,733
All right.

222
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,533
Is it done?

223
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:47,400
- It looks good, sir. 
 - Thank you.

224
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,033
Did you check out the nursing home properly?

225
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,667
Yes.

226
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:59,433
But I don't want to send Mr. Chun Pil to the nursing home.

227
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:02,833
Motel California without Mr. Chun Pil feels too weird.

228
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,200
I feel the same.

229
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,133
Let's try to dissuade him from going to the nursing home.

230
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:09,833
We are all here, so there is no reason to go there.

231
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,200
I feel like he's rushing because of us.

232
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,067
I think he doesn't want to burden us.

233
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,233
Isn't there another way?

234
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,600
All right.

235
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,600
Seung Eon,

236
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,433
didn't you review the lesson from last time?

237
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,067
I did, but I couldn't remember it.

238
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:41,100
You can memorize all the poems I wrote, but you couldn't memorize this book?

239
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,667
That's because you recorded them all.

240
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:48,867
Shall I record this book for you as well?

241
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,200
- Really? 
 - Yes.

242
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,067
Then I'd appreciate it.

243
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,167
Cha Seung Eon, don't give up. Understand?

244
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,633
Answer me.

245
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,267
Yes.

246
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,467
Next chapter.

247
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,700
Ah Reum.

248
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,333
What is it?

249
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,900
Hand cream, you said you ran out last time.

250
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,836
Thank you.

251
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,900
Apply it for me.

252
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,033
No, it's okay.

253
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,700
Give me your hand!

254
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:44,467
A bit here, a bit there.

255
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,533
Your hands are really small.

256
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,900
♫  All I want to do is take you home while looking at the stars  ♫

257
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,660
♫  I think I've come to love you  ♫

258
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,200
What's going on?

259
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,833
Because of you…

260
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,067
Did you see that?

261
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,167
It was like…

262
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,890
It was an atmosphere where beauty, excitement,

263
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,500
and pheromones were all mixed together.

264
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,033
Is holding hands like this really supposed to be so erotic?

265
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,033
Let's try harder, too.

266
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,033
What?

267
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,900
Follow me.

268
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:40,233
♫  Why do I get curious about you during the day?   ♫

269
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,300
Are you going to be like this?

270
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,233
She perks her ears up and reacts very well to the surrounding noise.

271
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:54,067
I don't see any lameness now, so it seems everything is okay now.

272
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:57,160
That's a relief. Right?

273
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,800
♫  I'll take you home  ♫

274
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,933
What are they doing?

275
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Hey, hey, hey.

276
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,300
We're not like that. Don't get the wrong idea.

277
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,467
What do you mean by that?

278
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:22,767
We were just naming the donkey…

279
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,400
- I didn't ask. 
 - We're really nothing.

280
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,500
Yeah, right, so…

281
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,400
Just finish what you were doing.

282
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,133
- Go for it! 
 - I really mean it.

283
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,267
Senior.

284
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:46,233
We're really nothing?

285
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,800
No, it's not that…

286
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,100
Let's just go now.

287
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,033
Wait.

288
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,700
Ms. Nan Woo.

289
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:02,133
Can I confess?

290
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,500
What? You said you wouldn't wear this.

291
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
No way, you gave it to me.

292
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,667
You still have this?

293
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:30,400
Of course, you gave it to me.

294
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:35,200
Find the most appropriate one, okay?

295
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,700
Do I have to look here, then?

296
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:41,800
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

297
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,350
What? Red, blue…

298
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,800
You two look like the Korean flag. So tacky.

299
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,033
Kang Hee, didn't you see something really weird at the animal hospital yesterday?

300
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,433
- The donkey? 
 - No, no.

301
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,333
Something even weirder than that.

302
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,233
Couples?

303
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeon Soo, who gave Ah Reum the hand cream yesterday?

304
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,900
He didn't give it to her.

305
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,033
- He applied it to her. 
 - He applied it to her.

306
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh, what are you talking about?

307
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,567
Now that I look at it, the color of your scarf is really pretty.

308
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,867
Have a good date, I'm sorry.

309
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,133
All right.

310
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,633
Yeah.

311
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,800
Do they have something on you?

312
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,400
No? What about you?

313
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,967
What?

314
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,300
Let's have some potatoes, grilled squid,

315
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
and also buy sweet potato sticks at the rest area.

316
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,000
Can you eat all of them?

317
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,433
Yes.

318
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,933
   

319
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,667
Yes, hello.

320
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,600
Oh, is she unable to walk because she collapsed?

321
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,533
It hasn't been long since she gave birth, right?

322
00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:00,867
Yes, I'll go now, yes.

323
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,367
What are you doing? Go quickly.

324
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,633
I'll contact you when it's done, see you in Seoul.

325
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:09,700
Don't overdo it, and give me a call.

326
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,900
Get back safely.

327
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,400
I'll honestly tell you why I got divorced.

328
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,433
Truly, he was an unparalleled con artist.

329
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:38,967
From the beginning, he approached me for my money, not for me.

330
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,367
It seems like you have a similar pain to mine.

331
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:44,200
I know that feeling of betrayal very well.

332
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,700
It's fortunate that you found out before having a child.

333
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,267
I'm pregnant.

334
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,267
What? No way.

335
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,800
Sorry, I'm sorry.

336
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
I've lived in the U.S. for a long time.

337
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,833
Anyway, so… Open-minded.

338
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,167
- Take care. 
 - Yes.

339
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:14,200
Manager, where are you?

340
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,400
Kang Hee, sorry. How was the meeting?

341
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,900
How can you arrange the meeting and then skip it?

342
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,200
Did you forget the meeting time?

343
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,900
I can't leave because I have something important right now.

344
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,400
Can you come over here, Kang Hee?

345
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,700
What's the matter?

346
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,133
- Esther is now… 
 - Okay.

347
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,633
Then, have a great day.

348
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:35,967
Bye.

349
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,700
Got to go, Kang Hee.

350
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,833
I'll call you later.

351
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,933
Hey.

352
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,067
How could you send him away without introducing him to me?

353
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:47,333
- It's a no. 
 - Why? Don't you like him?

354
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:51,133
He was babbling in English, and he reminded me a lot of that rat Victor.

355
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:53,733
That's not okay. Disqualified.

356
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:57,700
Oh, then what kind of man should you meet next time?

357
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,500
Lawyer, Kim Seong Cheol.

358
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,433
How about this person?

359
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,167
I don't think I need to meet him.

360
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:07,333
What? Not good again?

361
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,533
Thanks to someone, my self-esteem has skyrocketed.

362
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,230
I think I can raise my baby well on my own.

363
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,067
You'll help me, right?

364
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:21,067
Of course, I'm the godfather.

365
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:24,767
Even if you don't, Little Heart will really like me.

366
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,600
Wait and see.

367
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,100
Okay.

368
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:55,033
Are you done? Will you come?

369
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,600
What?

370
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,200
Got it, I'll go right away.

371
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,500
He's selling the motel?

372
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,600
People trying to buy the motel were coming in and out, causing a real commotion.

373
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,167
Mr. Kwon, what does this mean?

374
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,367
There's a letter from the boss.

375
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,733
A letter?

376
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
Hello?

377
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,500
 This is Ji Chun Pil, the manager of Motel California. 

378
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,300
 The Motel California, which has warmly embraced us 

379
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,000
 until now, is about to leave our embrace. 

380
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,767
However, its spirit will remain and is expected to transfer into my bank account.

381
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:08,567
I understand that this could be very shocking and confusing.

382
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,467
It can't be helped.

383
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,967
Now, you'll each leave the motel

384
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:17,867
and find your own homes.

385
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,633
"Once you decide on a place, come and find me.

386
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:24,233
If you need a loan, I'll give you one."

387
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:37,700
It's something I could have never imagined.

388
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,600
- Me too. 
 - Me too.

389
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,267
Me too.

390
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,633
There are so many memories here.

391
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,033
 All right. 

392
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,767
 Hold on. 

393
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,433
 Suddenly? 

394
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,667
 In about a year, you will grow this tall. 

395
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,333
 Right? 

396
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:31,810
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

397
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,900
♫  Like the rain that always falls  ♫

398
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,900
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

399
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,100
♫  Let's chat under the crescent moon  ♫

400
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:55,100
♫  You're still everything to me  ♫

401
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:00,700
♫  Please be my forest, embrace me  ♫

402
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,100
 Mom. 

403
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,200
 - Are you going to help me? 
 - Yes. 

404
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,100
 It'll be heavy. 

405
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,367
 Here it is. 

406
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,833
 Let's make it more beautiful. 

407
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,833
 Wow. 

408
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,900
 It's so pretty. 

409
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,933
 Look at the stars. 

410
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,200
♫  I worry about the what-ifs, what if your heart gets hurt? ♫

411
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
 Hello. I brought everything. 

412
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,167
 - All right, today's Korean. 
 - 10, 100… 

413
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:44,133
I've got 100.

414
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:46,267
 No. 

415
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:53,200
♫  No one can replace you ♫

416
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,100
   

417
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,200
 - Catch me if you can. 
 - Hey! 

418
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,900
 I'll go with you. 

419
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,300
 Me, too. 

420
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
 Hey, won't you stop there? 

421
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,633
 Dibs! 

422
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,550
♫  I will hug the anxious you  ♫

423
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,567
   

424
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,967
Yeah, come in.

425
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:54,533
Excuse me, let me take a quick look.

426
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:57,233
This room is big, and it even has a terrace.

427
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,067
This is exactly what Mr. Park was looking for.

428
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:02,267
Break the bathroom to install a glass wall.

429
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:03,933
No, no.

430
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:07,100
I need to split this room in half.

431
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,500
Why would I need a terrace?

432
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,700
People come to a motel to sleep, not to sightsee.

433
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,000
Please leave.

434
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,900
- What's the matter? 
 - Ah, I'm telling you to leave.

435
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
- Are you the boss? 
 - I'm asking if you're the boss.

436
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,400
- I'm telling you to leave. 
 - Okay, I'm going.

437
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,367
I'll go, jeez.

438
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,300
The price is a bit high.

439
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,100
The price is one thing, but why does a motel need such a space?

440
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,400
This is a serious waste of space, overall.

441
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,900
How much will it cost to renovate all of this?

442
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,300
If it's not us, no one else will buy this motel.

443
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,900
Please leave.

444
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,767
The price is a bit…

445
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:47,967
Please leave.

446
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:51,333
It seems like the owner…

447
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:54,167
Let's just go, let's go.

448
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,267
Doesn't have much business acumen.

449
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,667
Where is he?

450
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,967
Where is Mr. Chun Pil?

451
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,233
   

452
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,800
Mr. Chun Pil.

453
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,133
It turns out he really is sick.

454
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,233
How do I look?

455
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,133
Does my smile look natural?

456
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,633
Yes.

457
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:31,767
What about my voice? Is it okay?

458
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,067
Yes.

459
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:40,300
I'll be back.

460
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Are you having a hard time?

461
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,700
Yes, I'm seeing things. There was definitely a nurse earlier.

462
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,800
I can see my daughter in front of me.

463
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,467
It's me.

464
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,100
I'll stay for just one night.

465
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,600
I've seen your face, that's enough, go.

466
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,033
I came because I have something to ask.

467
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:52,233
Motel California is like a part of you.

468
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,567
Why do you suddenly want to sell it?

469
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:28,400
 May I ask the reason? 

470
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
 Because I'm scared. 

471
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,100
 Pardon? 

472
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,300
 Because I'm scared. 

473
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,000
 Holding on to the memories piled up here, 

474
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,700
 I might get obsessed. 

475
00:42:56,533 --> 00:43:02,100
 And while letting someone take care of my illness, 

476
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,567
 I'm afraid I might want to live. 

477
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:10,700
 That's also why. 

478
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,767
 No, our Kang Hee… 

479
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,033
 After I die, I don't want my Kang Hee... 

480
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,300
 to be here at Motel California, 

481
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:28,167
 struggling alone with the memories. 

482
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:33,867
 I have to clear it out, cleanly. 

483
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,233
Can't you not sell it?

484
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,000
It's hard to take care of my own body.

485
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,300
It's cumbersome.

486
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,167
Then give it to me.

487
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,067
You were going to give it to me when you died anyway.

488
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:01,833
Give it to me in advance.

489
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,700
You hate motels, don't you?

490
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,000
I can change it.

491
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,200
I have things to do there.

492
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,500
What will you do?

493
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,333
In the future,

494
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:13,833
I'll have a daughter who resembles me.

495
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,033
Are you pregnant?

496
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:17,933
I said in the future.

497
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,600
If it's a daughter who resembles me,

498
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,300
I can't raise her alone, you need to help raise her.

499
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,400
You've raised me, Chun Pil.

500
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,900
You did a good job.

501
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,400
- I'll build a nursing home. 
 - Huh?

502
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,167
Looking at you, it looks like you need that.

503
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,833
No, what's the use of having an interior design expert as a daughter?

504
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,800
You should use her skills in such times.

505
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,700
Chun Pil,

506
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,933
I'll make you want to live a long time.

507
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:58,133
I'll completely change our house.

508
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:00,467
How will you change it?

509
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,433
- Completely! 
 - Completely!

510
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,367
That's funny.

511
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:12,300
I convinced Chun Pil.

512
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:16,767
I told Chun Pil that I would make our house beautiful

513
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:22,633
so he would want to live a long, long life, and he said he'd think about it.

514
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:24,633
Then it's settled.

515
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:28,633
Well, who could beat our Kang Hee?

516
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,600
There's just one person.

517
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,800
Who is it?

518
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,600
Don't you know?

519
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,500
Cheon Yeon Soo.

520
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,200
- Me? 
 - Yes.

521
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,000
No way.

522
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,600
What do you mean "no way"?

523
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,700
How can I beat you?

524
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,900
What do you mean by that?

525
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,900
You always win.

526
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,300
I never won.

527
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,900
We were really cute when we were young.

528
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,000
Hey, your lips.

529
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,000
Hey, Han Ah Reum, do this for me once.

530
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,833
Hey, you do it.

531
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,533
She's closer.

532
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:05,400
I just went and came back.

533
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,600
What?

534
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Kang Hee, when Chun Pil comes, we'll try to persuade him together.

535
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,467
I'll also bring some pictures.

536
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,900
So cute.

537
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,400
Here, do this while eating.

538
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,500
Thank you.

539
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,667
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy your meal.

540
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,467
I want to do it, too.

541
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:31,133
   

542
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,433
Come in.

543
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,633
You weren't asleep.

544
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:49,267
What?

545
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,033
What's this?

546
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,867
Use this money to help build the nursing home.

547
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,300
Hey.

548
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:06,933
Look at this.

549
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:18,167
   

550
00:47:23,733 --> 00:47:25,700
Seung Eon.

551
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:28,500
I'm his son.

552
00:47:29,067 --> 00:47:31,200
The government acknowledged it.

553
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,767
Yes, that's right.

554
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:36,867
So…

555
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,633
Whatever you do, let's do it together.

556
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,300
You are reliable, my little brother.

557
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,600
My birthday is before yours, you know?

558
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,267
So?

559
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,167
Even so, I'm still younger.

560
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,600
Say "big sis".

561
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,600
- Big sis. 
 - Ah, I don't want to.

562
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,800
Good night, little brother.

563
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,833
Good night, little brother.

564
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:04,633
Good night.

565
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:07,100
Big sis.

566
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:10,967
Goodbye.

567
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:37,167
Kang Hee, drink while you work.

568
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,833
- Thank you. 
 - Go for it.

569
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,833
Go for it.

570
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:45,833
The lawn is laid, and the furniture has arrived.

571
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,233
The construction is finally over.

572
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:50,933
So is the official relationship over, too?

573
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:52,800
Wasn't it over already?

574
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,600
You didn't even come to Hana-eup for a while.

575
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,900
I admit it. I apologize.

576
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,600
Thank you for the quick apology.

577
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:03,167
I have a confession.

578
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,733
I thought you were using me.

579
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,200
But looking back,

580
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:12,867
I was the one using you.

581
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:16,500
I already knew. From the beginning.

582
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,200
From the beginning?

583
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
From the outside, it's obvious.

584
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Only the two of you don't know.

585
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,867
- Really? 
 - Yes.

586
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:27,733
I bet even Little Heart knows by now.

587
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,867
That you two like each other.

588
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,200
Oh, so that's why your heart wasn't swayed by me.

589
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,933
No wonder.

590
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,567
I know that your feelings for me were genuine.

591
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:45,800
Thank you for treating me well all this time.

592
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,900
I don't know if I'll continue to treat you well.

593
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,000
But I'll keep the promise I made to you.

594
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,933
The promise to have a grand opening ceremony.

595
00:50:56,933 --> 00:51:00,133
The decoration team will come. And there will be an on-site buffet.

596
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:04,300
We'll gather all the villagers and make it grand.

597
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,500
Then can I hold an event there?

598
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,200
Of course, do whatever you want.

599
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,800
- All right. 
 - When can I open my eyes?

600
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,600
- You can open your eyes soon. 
 - Got it.

601
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,367
- You're going forward. 
 - Yes.

602
00:51:22,633 --> 00:51:24,733
Open your eyes now.

603
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:26,833
- Am I opening my eyes now? 
 - Yes.

604
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:37,233
Wow.

605
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,833
Wow, it's pretty.

606
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,200
I wanted to show you first.

607
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,200
I'm touched.

608
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,767
Ahjussi will really like it.

609
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:54,700
I'm excited.

610
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,333
Me, too.

611
00:51:57,933 --> 00:51:59,500
Yeon Soo.

612
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,000
Tomorrow is really important to me, right?

613
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,000
That I didn't live a wasted life in Seoul.

614
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,533
That I am not the daughter dragging down Mr. Chun Pil.

615
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:15,400
I really want to show everyone.

616
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,567
It will be like that.

617
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:24,167
All right.

618
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:27,967
I'm proud of you, Ji Kang Hee.

619
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,433
I'm proud of you.

620
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,300
Isn't he crying because he's proud of you?

621
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,400
I'm going to do a presentation about the nursing home to Mr. Chun Pil.

622
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,067
Then, have you finished the design?

623
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,833
Yeah, should I show you?

624
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,000
- Close your eyes again. 
 - Again?

625
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,800
- This time, we're running. 
 - Got it.

626
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,400
All right.

627
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,900
Run!

628
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,000
Hey, I'm scared! I'm scared!

629
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,100
Another one, another one.

630
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,067
Another one, one more.

631
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:04,900
One more, one more.

632
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,200
One more, we are almost there.

633
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,100
Now, one more!

634
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,500
Since when did you open your eyes?

635
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,400
- From the beginning. 
 - What?

636
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,400
Wow, are we doing it here?

637
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Yes.

638
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,600
   

639
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,967
Ta-da!

640
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,300
All right, from now on,

641
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,400
I, Ji Kang Hee, will now lead the PT.

642
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,650
Yes, understood.

643
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,600
♫  I hope you'll come close to me  ♫

644
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,600
♫  Love hidden deep in the heart  ♫

645
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:43,420
♫  Will fall on the world like white snow  ♫

646
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,667
Oh, this is nice.

647
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,300
   

648
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,000
All right, let's start the rehearsal.

649
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,600
For now, don't actually cut it, but just pretend to cut.

650
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,300
So, don't cut the tape, cut the air.

651
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,500
We'll do the actual cutting when the client arrives.

652
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,900
But why are we doing a rehearsal?

653
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,000
We need to practice.

654
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,600
One, two, three.

655
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,300
Like this.

656
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,700
   

657
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,800
You're cool, Ji Kang Hee.

658
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,000
Looking good, Otel Hana.

659
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Great, please show the same enthusiasm during the main event.

660
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,900
I also prepared fireworks.

661
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,500
Kang Hee, can we throw confetti?

662
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,367
Sure.

663
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,900
Yeah.

664
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,733
Huh?

665
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,000
No.

666
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:51,067
Mr. Chun Pil can't come.

667
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:52,433
Should we postpone?

668
00:54:52,433 --> 00:54:54,367
He told us to do it by ourselves.

669
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,600
Gosh, I don't understand. You go there.

670
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,900
You guys wanted that, right?

671
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,800
Why is everyone gathered here?

672
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,100
If you go there, they provide a buffet too,

673
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,800
and they give out coupons and all.

674
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,100
Oh, it must be nice.

675
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,400
So go.

676
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,500
It looks better than the hotel in the neighboring town.

677
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,600
Right, the whole neighborhood has brightened up.

678
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,267
It's the landmark of our Hana-eup.

679
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:22,667
That's right.

680
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:25,433
Oh, Kang Hee.

681
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:27,500
Why are you here? Aren't you attending the event?

682
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,900
Hurry and go attend the event.

683
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,800
You're the main character today.

684
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Right, we'll take care of him,

685
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,500
so hurry and go.

686
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,500
Oh, you raised your daughter well.

687
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,267
Yeah, she's been diligent since she was young.

688
00:55:42,267 --> 00:55:44,133
Right, right.

689
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,467
- So diligent. 
 - So smart.

690
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:53,167
Thank you.

691
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:57,167
In the future, please come often to visit Chun Pil.

692
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,733
- Of course. 
 - Don't worry.

693
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,567
Oh my.

694
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,400
♫  Let's go home now to the place where we rested comfortably  ♫

695
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,400
I went to see Chun Pil, but the village elders were there.

696
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,600
So I thanked them and asked them to take care of him.

697
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,300
Like you said.

698
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,733
Well done.

699
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,467
Oh my, so pretty.

700
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,333
You did great.

701
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,500
But we're late.

702
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,300
Where to?

703
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,000
♫  I look at your lovely every day  ♫

704
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,300
♫  And then you smile pretty, pretty ♫

705
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,233
Oh, are you here, manager?

706
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,360
♫  It's my great luck to me  ♫

707
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,830
♫  The sunset is particularly beautiful  ♫

708
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,800
I'll go upstairs and come back.

709
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,020
♫  Walk slowly, no rush, babe ♫

710
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,667
Here, I brought the main character.

711
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:24,070
♫  I'll prepare everything you like 
 The normal becomes special  ♫

712
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:29,090
♫  Towards the dreams we dreamed  ♫

713
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,000
Hey guys, what are you doing? Kang Hee is here.

714
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,100
Didn't you have something to say?

715
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,600
- Go. 
 - Let's go.

716
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,333
Ji Kang Hee, you look quite cool.

717
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:55,833
A rooftop pool in Hana-eup, that's amazing.

718
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:58,480
I'm a country bumpkin, so I've never seen anything like this.

719
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,160
It's huge.

720
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,200
I always knew you would succeed.

721
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,900
Honestly…

722
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,767
Hey, let's eat.

723
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:22,733
I heard the news about Mr. Ji.

724
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,733
But don't worry too much about it.

725
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:29,933
My father had cancer too, but after surgery, he's perfectly fine.

726
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:31,200
Don't worry about things like that.

727
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,000
If you really want to run the nursing home… I'll invest.

728
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,433
No, not investing. I'll donate.

729
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:40,733
What? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

730
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,633
I'm afraid I might get struck by lightning.

731
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,400
Honestly, I did bully you.

732
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
But you bullied me a lot, too. Right?

733
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,000
Like, flying kicks and striking like lightning.

734
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,500
Anyway,

735
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,667
I'm sorry, Kang Hee.

736
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,633
It's too late, but I'll apologize, too.

737
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:09,367
I'm sorry.

738
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,167
Sorry.

739
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:19,600
Kang Hee, I'm really sorry.

740
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:24,033
I'm less sorry.

741
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,700
Instead, I'll help you with a talent donation.

742
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,100
Before I became a police officer, my dream was to be a recreation instructor.

743
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,500
I even have a certification.

744
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,400
You should have ended it as a dream.

745
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,700
And me, too…

746
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,500
If you have any questions or need anything while running the nursing home, let me know.

747
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,600
Tell me anytime, then I'll do whatever I can.

748
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,800
Because we're friends.

749
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,567
What? Why are you all like this?

750
00:59:53,867 --> 00:59:57,400
Hey, I came to remodel the motel.

751
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:02,867
I didn't know I'd remodel my life, too.

752
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,833
Oh, seriously stop it, everyone.

753
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,733
- Should I hug you? 
 - Is Kang Hee crying?

754
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,800
No.

755
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,600
- Are you crying? 
 - What's wrong? Gross.

756
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,800
Look at your face.

757
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,667
Looks like everything's resolved.

758
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,600
Look at the eyes, look at the eyes.

759
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
Just hug Yeon Soo for now.

760
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,100
So what?

761
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,000
If Yeon Soo allows it, you can do it.

Are you okay?

779
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:32,933
Kwon, what's wrong with this?

780
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:34,933
- Ah, yes. 
 - It's your responsibility.

781
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:36,400
Merry Christmas.

782
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,433
- Merry Christmas. 
 - Merry Christmas.

783
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:42,267
You should blow.

784
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:47,900
Oh, thank you, these little munchkins.

785
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,800
These little things suddenly grew up and became bigger than me.

786
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,100
Thank you, everyone

787
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,167
for giving me such precious gifts.

788
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:00,367
I will never forget this forever.

789
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:03,800
I will live long and happily remember this day.

790
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,000
Kwon, thank you.

791
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,733
Yeon Soo as well.

792
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:10,600
Ah Reum.

793
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,233
Our Han Woo, oh, looks good.

794
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,833
My son.

795
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,900
Our Seung Eon, thank you.

796
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,200
And also my daughter.

797
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,000
Why did you give such a precious gift to me?

798
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,200
What am I supposed to do?

799
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
Jeez.

800
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,920
Dad,

801
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,533
I love you.

802
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:56,633
Don't get sick, don't die.

803
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:59,333
And live long and healthy.

804
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:03,167
Let's live happily, joyfully,

805
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,367
and excitedly with me.

806
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:13,233
Enough, enough!

807
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:16,033
Oh, I got goosebumps too.

808
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,067
It's snow!

809
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:20,567
- Wow. 
 - Wow.

810
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:22,200
White Christmas!

811
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,933
- White Christmas! 
 - Merry Christmas.

812
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,867
- Kwon. 
 - Yes.

813
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:35,133
On snowy days, we have to eat rice cake ramyeon.

814
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:37,933
- I'll prepare it. 
 - Rice cake ramyeon, deal?

815
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,700
It's been a long time, catching snow together.

816
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,167
Ji Kang Hee, do you know that?

817
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,733
What?

818
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:05,133
They say if you eat the first snow ten times, you'll be with your first love.

819
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,000
Really?

820
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,600
That…

821
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,400
I lied to you about that.

822
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:19,300
So what if it's a lie?

823
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,167
It came true.

824
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,667
Is it so?

825
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:35,200
♫  Hug me tightly  ♫

826
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,900
♫  Will you suddenly leave me like an imaginary person? ♫

827
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,833
Six times.

828
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:53,900
♫  Can you hear my pounding heart?  ♫

829
01:04:53,900 --> 01:05:00,600
♫  I'm scared, so I'll just ask  ♫

830
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,200
Ten times, all eaten!

831
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,300
Ugh, fool.

832
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,100
 I wish I had my own room. 

833
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,000
 Your house has many rooms. 

834
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,600
 Not that kind of room. 

835
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:28,367
 When I grow up, I'm going to live in a house like this. 

836
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:32,300
 A house with a room, a living room, 

837
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,800
 a kitchen, and a yard. 

838
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,600
 I'll build it for you. 

839
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,867
Just like you used to do,

840
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,000
I won't go anywhere,

841
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,467
and I'll stay close to you.

842
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:59,267
I love you.

843
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:05,233
I love you.

844
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:13,300
♫  Please smile at me, I don't need anything else  ♫

845
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:19,500
♫  I will fill your eyes  ♫

846
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:26,200
♫  Please speak to me, you are in my heart  ♫

847
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,067
Okay, I'm going to take it.

848
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,700
- Motel California! 
 - California!

849
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,750
Go for it!

850
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:42,860


851
01:06:42,867 --> 01:06:44,233
Oh, cell phone, cell phone.

852
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,000
On your forehead!

853
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,200
   

854
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,820
♫  I'm only looking for you  ♫

855
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,270
♫  Please smile at me  ♫
