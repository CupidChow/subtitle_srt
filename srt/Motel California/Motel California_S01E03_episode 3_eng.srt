1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,800
   

2
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:47,090


3
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:58,000
 Seoul men are all handsome and stylish. 

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,833
 Imagine how ashamed and embarrassed she was 

5
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,267
 that someone like me showed up. 

6
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,967
 Darn it! 

7
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,867
 Hey! You're not shameful or an embarrassment! 

8
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,533
 If that's true, 

9
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:15,200
 I'm ashamed to have accepted such behavior for over 10 years as the boss. 

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,033
 Hey, don't swear. 

11
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,600
 It's not Kang Hee's fault. 

12
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,633
 You accepted this, of all things, as a "gift"? 

13
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,300
 Hey, give it to me, it's mine. 

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,433
 My god! Idiot, simpleton. 

15
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,000
 Han Woo. 

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,867
 What? 

17
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,967
 - I've decided. 
 - On what? 

18
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:41,900
 I... am going to lose weight! 

19
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,533
 Fighting! 

20
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,130
 I can do it! 

21
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,533
 I'll lose weight, become handsome, and go to see Kang Hee again. 

22
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,900
 Yeon Soo, it seems this life is a mistake. 

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,967
 Until that day comes, no carbonated drinks whatsoever. 

24
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,500
 Gods, what a waste. 

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,700
 Not long ago, you said Kang Hee would kill you if you lost weight and ate ramen every night. 

26
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,100
 Didn't you recently eat ramen with sausages? 

27
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,333
 The Cheon Yeon Soo you knew is dead. 

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
 I will be reborn. 

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,500
 Seven, eight, nine, 

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 ten, eleven… 

31
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,633
 Twelve… 

32
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,267
 No, no. 

33
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,767
 Three.

00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,900

 It's that man. 

60
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,833
Please transfer ownership of Kang Hee to me.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,833
I will take responsibility.

62
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,733
No.

63
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,200
- It's not this room. 
 - Excuse me?

64
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,967
Come out, quickly.

65
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,533
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,767
It's been a while.

67
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,900
Have we met before?

68
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,533
I said let's get out of here quickly.

69
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:35,167
Ten years ago, we met once.

70
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,767
If it was ten years ago…

71
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:42,000
When she was working at the convenience store, you recorded a video...

72
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,033
of the boss who didn't pay and verbally abused her.

73
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,933
That was you then, right?

74
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,900
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,667
See, I told you we definitely met before.

76
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,533
You knew all along, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

77
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,767
Then why did you pretend not to know me?

78
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,167
When did I say anything about transferred ownership?

79
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:14,000
My ownership is mine. I won't give it to anyone.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Yes, this! This is the expression I fell for.

81
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,967
This look in your eyes, this hair color.

82
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm telling you, this just can't be replicated.

83
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,467
I won't let you go until I hear an answer, so tell me.

84
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,567
Why did you pretend not to know me?

85
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't like working with people from the past.

86
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,500
Oh, that's exciting.

87
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,333
I really like that answer.

88
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,533
Then let's talk about the future, not the past.

89
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,700
You're heading up, right?

90
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,100
I was on my way down.

91
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm not going to the after-party.

92
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,100
I won't take you along. No need to ruin the mood there.

93
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,600
Let's work together.

94
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,733
   

95
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,033
Please come to our hotel design team.

96
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,133
 The door is closing. 

97
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,000
What now?

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,833
- Merry Christmas. 
  - Going down. 

99
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:20,000
 The door is closing. 

100
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:51,400
Ah, this is all because of that Chun Pil.

101
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,867
Oh, wonderful daughter, happy birthday.

102
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,900
Um, that is… I mean…

103
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeon Soo had something to tell you, begging and pleading…

104
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,867
That's what I did…

105
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,600
Hello, are you listening?

106
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,700
Our last Christmas together,

107
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,000
just know that you blew it off splendidly.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,533
I will never contact you again.

109
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:37,210
Take care and live well, Mr. Chun Pil.

110
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
 Yeon Soo. 

111
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,367
 I wonder if Seoul is very cold too? 

112
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,233
 What if it's very cold? 

113
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:16,033
 If it's cold and tough, 

114
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,000
 come back anytime, Kang Hee. 

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
 I'll wait here. 

116
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:29,200
 Whenever that is, I'll just be waiting for you. 

117
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,433
Kang Hee.

118
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,133
I'm cold.

119
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,233
Who told you to show up, out of the blue?

120
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,833
Sorry.

121
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,333
Don't look at me like that.

122
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,433
I'm not going to hurt you.

123
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,333
Do you care for any wine?

124
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,167
I'm cold.

125
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,967
Ah, right?

126
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,367
I'll get you something warm.

127
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:04,933
Do you have chamomile?

128
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,800
Yes, take a seat and wait a moment.

129
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Thank you for coming that day.

130
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,067
Thanks to you, I bade my grandfather farewell.

131
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,700
I'm sure grandfather was happy that you came.

132
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Do you think so?

133
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,300
All we ever did was fight.

134
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
It wasn't your fault.

135
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,367
- What happened? 
 - Huh?

136
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:21,067
Why are you here today?

137
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,033
It was your father's request.

138
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:29,533
That and... I've caught the first snow ten times.

139
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,233
Huh?

140
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,333
I said I'm ready.

141
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,633
Ready for what?

142
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,467
Anything.

143
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,700
You're saying you'll come to Seoul?

144
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,867
There's nothing I can't do.

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,567
Hey, aren't you a large animal veterinarian?

146
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,867
There are no cows in Seoul.

147
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,533
But you're here.

148
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,767
Purple Tok!

149
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,100
This?

150
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,633
It's the one you gave me, that day.

151
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:16,433
- Really? 
 - Yes.

152
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,500
Look at the expiration date.

153
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,633
This teddy bear…

154
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,900
No, you're not even a teddy bear anymore.

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,733
This is my favorite champagne.

156
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:55,267
Chun Pil gave it to me, saying it's a gift for you.

157
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,833
And you?

158
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,467
Don't you have a gift?

159
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,967
Surprise!

160
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,767
Lame...

161
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,900
Open it.

162
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,967
Isn't this something you should give to a girlfriend?

163
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,267
You know I don't have one.

164
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:45,033
How would I know? It's been 10 years.

165
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:47,733
You've changed so much.

166
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,500
I almost didn't recognize you.

167
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,833
I said I would wait.

168
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,733
For life.

169
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
I said I'd only like you.

170
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,767
Let me try this on.

171
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
How is it?

172
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,600
Kang Hee.

173
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,433
Be honest, did you not miss me?

174
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,667
 Don't use that tone. 

175
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,900
I really wanted to see you.

176
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,667
 Don't smile like that. 

177
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,367
I thought about you all month, even dreamed about you.

178
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,633
Don't joke like that, it makes my heart flutter.

179
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't… Don't listen.

180
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,233
No, even if you heard it, pretend you didn't.

181
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,910
♫  Close your eyes and feel me here  ♫

182
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,110
♫  What color is in your mind?  ♫

183
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,830
♫  Blue, dark gray, calm and sweet  ♫

184
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,480
♫  I can give you all  ♫

185
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:43,490
♫  Please tell me if you're standing here for me  ♫

186
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,840
♫  Far across the dream, just call my name  ♫

187
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,550
♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

188
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:59,190
♫  Here I am  ♫

189
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,067
Answer it.

190
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,667
I don't want to take it.

191
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,167
It keeps ringing.

192
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,367
   

193
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:26,000
Just a moment.

194
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,767
What's wrong, Mom? Are you okay?

195
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:38,050
 Yeon Soo, here… it hurts. 

196
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,267
Wait a moment.

197
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,167
Merry Christmas.

198
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,250
 Her eyes are exactly like her mom's. 

199
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,110
 She'll hear you. 

200
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,760
 - That's fine. 
 - Her purse is obviously a fake. 

201
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,250
 She fled our town at night, just like her mom did.  

202
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,210
 To be honest, I pity her.  

203
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,970
 Her mutt gaze is just like it was before. 

204
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,210
 She was so obviously a mutt before, 

205
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,260
 but now that she's grown, you can't tell as easily. 

206
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,130
 The older she gets, the more she resembles her mom. 

207
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,450
 That's why Chun Ja or Chun Pil, 

208
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,080
 one of them should've left our town ages ago.  

209
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,950
 - Be quiet. 
 - What if she loses it again? 

210
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,020
 That's right.  I told you it would be like this 

211
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,567
Sorry, did you wait long?

212
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,800
I remembered everything.

213
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,433
What did you remember?

214
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:04,033
Why I left.

215
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,600
You...

216
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,667
and I…

217
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,467
Why it didn't work.

218
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:22,600
Why didn't it work?

219
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,567
Save this for your girlfriend.

220
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Kang Hee.

221
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,300
Hey, Ji Kang Hee.

222
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,767
If you go now,

223
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,700
I won't wait anymore.

224
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,733
That's what I've been hoping for.

225
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,633
Our first love...

226
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,733
ends here.

227
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,400
The end.

228
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,533
Are you serious?

229
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:37,900
Let's live well separately.

230
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,067
Thank you for liking me all this time.

231
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:41,370
♫  I realized it as I stared quietly into your eyes  ♫

232
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:49,090
♫  My love for you, fearlessly, keeps growing   ♫

233
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:56,690
♫  My confession that never reached you, I love you  ♫

234
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,700
♫  Will a part of my sincerity reach you today?  ♫

235
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,000
No, don't follow me.

236
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,870
I can't take responsibility for you.

237
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,870
♫  My clumsy confession to you  ♫

238
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:19,800
♫  has grown even larger since yesterday  ♫

239
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,840
♫  My shy, hesitant first words to you  ♫

240
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,033
Making someone wait when you can't even take responsibility,

241
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,800
I have to stop.

242
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,580
Meet someone better than me.

243
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,580
Be happy.

244
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,690
Goodbye.

245
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:54,700
♫  But it was all love  ♫

246
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,000
The man smashed everything up,

247
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,333
and the woman screamed.

248
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,767
I put up with it and when I finally went there,

249
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:14,167
this lady came out with her eyes this big.

250
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,230
Are you going to report the assault, ma'am?

251
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,633
Me? No, it wasn't me.

252
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,500
I just fell over.

253
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,000
No, I filed a report because of this condition.

254
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,833
Do you beat people up like that for filing a report, huh?

255
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:34,700
And in front of kids?

256
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,967
You admit it, right?

257
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,400
Oh, I don't remember.

258
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,533
Yes, I saw everything.

259
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:45,067
Sir, just once, please make an exception just once.

260
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,300
And you, ma'am, get a grip.

261
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,333
How much longer will you live like this, getting hit?

262
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,600
This man just did it in a moment of anger.

263
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,733
But deep down, he is really kind.

264
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,133
He is kind.

265
00:25:55,133 --> 00:26:00,650
Sorry, but could I have a word alone with my mom?

266
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,167
- Yes. 
 - Just a moment.

267
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,633
Ah, I would also like to speak separately…

268
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,500
Sir, please sit down.

269
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,800
Take a seat.

270
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
- Sit down. 
 - No, I said sit down, quickly.

271
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,033
If there's a misunderstanding, solve it…

272
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,967
Sit down, sit down. Just sit down first.

273
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,200
Sit down and clear the misunderstanding.

274
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,833
No, I will sit.

275
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,533
Oh, it's cold.

276
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,167
- Mom. 
 - I need settlement money, Yeon Soo.

277
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,100
Did that rat hit you?

278
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,000
That rat?

279
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,733
Hey, watch your words, that's your father!

280
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,267
Your workshop salary,

281
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:38,467
you've saved some. Right? Lend me some, okay?

282
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:43,233
I'm asking you a question. Did you get hit?

283
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,100
Why can't you answer me? Why?

284
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,467
Yeon Soo.

285
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,867
What day is today?

286
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:52,533
Silent night, holy night.

287
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:58,167
On such a night, should loved ones part ways?

288
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:02,233
Let me stay with your dad for a while.

289
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,467
Okay? Please.

290
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,033
Ugh, it's cold.

291
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,567
Please.

292
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,733
Please, okay?

293
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,300
You don't have to do it.

294
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,067
Oh my, take care.

295
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,133
Thank you.

296
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeon Soo!

297
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,167
Thank you.

298
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,533
Let it be, will you?

299
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,433
Go there and buy some udon or something…

300
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,500
Go eat… hey, you!

301
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,533
I just wanted you to get a bowl of udon.

302
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:53,033
Yeon Soo, thank you.

303
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,133
Let's go. Are you hungry? What shall we eat?

304
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,700
Oh my, what?

305
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,467
 What should I do? 

306
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,900
That's upsetting.

307
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:32,100
 Now, let's start the 10-second countdown 

308
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,667
 to the New Year. 

309
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:39,633
 Ten, nine, eight, 

310
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:43,200
 seven, six, five, four, 

311
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,600
- three, two, one. 
 - Three, two, one.

312
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:52,400
Happy day!

313
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,033
We've gotten a year older.

314
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,300
Happy 30th!

315
00:28:57,367 --> 00:29:01,567
Today, you should avoid beef and just eat chicken.

316
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,433
 Cheerful voices spread everywhere encouraging a powerful start for all our citizens… 

317
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,230
   

318
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,133
Thank you.

319
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,700
How about starting with a salary of 30 million won? (~$21,000)

320
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,167
But there will be incentives for each project.

321
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:30,067
Well, there's a chance I won't get incentives.

322
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:32,533
It doesn't matter. I've wanted to try working on

323
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:37,500
the hotels and commercials that you, Director, I mean, CEO mostly handled.

324
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,467
Ms. Kang Hee.

325
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:45,667
Do you know what "aesthetic disharmony" means?

326
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:46,967
Pardon?

327
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:49,833
It refers to the estrangement between feeling genuinely beautiful

328
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,900
- and being forced to feel that way. 
 - Yes?

329
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,267
To be honest, I've felt that disconnection for a long time,

330
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,567
due to aesthetic disharmony.

331
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,033
Which is why I now want to do what I like.

332
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:05,767
What do you like?

333
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,033
Trot music.

334
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,000
Trot music?

335
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,467
How should I put it?

336
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:15,067
If the hotel is classic music, then trot is a motel?

337
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,100
I will not do it.

338
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,667
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

339
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,533
Yes, Mr. Hotel Heir?

340
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,233
This is Ji Kang Hee speaking.

341
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:37,933
Is the offer to work together still valid?

342
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:58,767
Hotels are okay, but motels aren't?

343
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,533
Was it all a scam, pretending to be a hotel heir?

344
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,200
You said so yourself.

345
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Your ownership rights are yours, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

346
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,167
After hearing that, I also came to claim my ownership. From my father.

347
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:14,367
I contacted you because I believed you were a hotel designer.

348
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:18,933
With the rapid growth of accommodation apps, the motel renovation market has expanded.

349
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:21,733
You can work much more dynamically and creatively than in hotels.

350
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,733
But after all, it's still a motel.

351
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,067
Why do you dislike motels so much?

352
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:28,000
- Because they are third-class. 
 - Pff!

353
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,933
Listen up, motel owners around the country…

354
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:34,733
Fine, let's say motels are third-class.

355
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:35,800
What's wrong with being third-class?

356
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,233
What would the son of a hotel owner know?

357
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:39,967
Unless you're the daughter of a motel owner, you wouldn't know.

358
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,267
You are the daughter of a motel owner?

359
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:48,267
Jackpot, Ms. Kang Hee.

360
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,733
That's really enviable.

361
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:57,567
If you live in a five-star hotel, do you think you'll become a five-star person?

362
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:01,433
I thought you had more than five-star charm, even if you were the daughter of a motel owner.

363
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:04,567
It's not that I'm the daughter of a motel owner, it's just that our home was a motel.

364
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,500
I was born in a motel, raised in a motel, all the way.

365
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,933
The way people stared at me while I was growing up.

366
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:13,133
Do you even know what I've been through?

367
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:17,867
When I was young, I didn't know any better and just… fell for my dad's words.

368
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,900
Nonsense.

369
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,000
 - Dad? 
 - Yes? 

370
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,667
 The kids won't hang out with me. Is it because motels are bad? 

371
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,467
 What? 

372
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:41,300
 What, who? Your friends say that? 

373
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,890
 I see... 

374
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:50,233
 Okay, Dad will explain. You need to listen closely. 

375
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,167
 Where do people go when they're hungry? 

376
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,067
 - A restaurant. 
 - Exactly. 

377
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:57,933
 When people are in need of sleep, where do they go? To a motel. 

378
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:01,367
 Why? Because they need a comfortable place to rest, right? 

379
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:04,367
 So, what should we do when such people come? 

380
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:08,400
 In a motel, we provide blankets, pillows, 

381
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,433
 and we can tell them, "Have a comfortable stay," "Sweet dreams." 

382
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,667
 That's what a motel is all about. 

383
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,467
 Do you understand now? 

384
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:19,900
 Oh, that sounds good. 

385
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,867
 Yeah, do you know what the most exciting thing at Motel California is? 

386
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,467
 Ramen, of course. 

387
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:28,667
 Want to eat some ramen? 

388
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,200
 Let's go! Dad will cook it for you. 

389
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,667
 The best ramen! Let's go. 

390
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,400
People don't come to the motel because they are sleepy, but just

391
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,000
to escape, to hide away.

392
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,333
In a word, it sucked.

393
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:45,033
Let's combine our efforts to change that perception.

394
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,267
For Ms. Kang Hee's father's sake, too.

395
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:50,000
My father passed away when I was ten.

396
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,367
So please, leave me out of it.

397
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,800
Ms. Kang Hee.

398
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,533
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

399
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,767
- I refuse. 
 - Okay.

400
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,533
Please open it.

401
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:17,067
What's the offer?

402
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,633
What's that?

403
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:32,433
   

404
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:35,733
   

405
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:41,200
Bang, bang!

406
00:35:57,467 --> 00:36:00,433
Father, why are you doing this all of a sudden?

407
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:03,200
That's really fast, that thing… Hey, come here, you.

408
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,967
Do you think I sold cattle and sent you to college for this?

409
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,733
I paid it all back, that thing.

410
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,533
Hey! If you're going to act all high and mighty, take the cattle you bought and get out.

411
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,800
No, please let me, Dad.

412
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,300
Ah, in the end… Won't you come here?

413
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,767
 Go ahead and talk like that in front of Mom. 

414
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,567
 Oh, really, Dad. 

415
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,167
- Come here! 
 - Testing. 1, 2.

416
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,667
What are you two doing, really?

417
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:27,667
- Why are you fighting out here, instead of under that nice roof of yours? 
 - Father, don't do it.

418
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,733
The cows want freedom, too.

419
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,500
I'm telling you to come here.

420
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,100
 - Just over there… 
 - Come here, you. 

421
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,667
 Father, why are you really doing this? 

422
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,400
I didn't do this for you to… come here! 
 ♪ Let's leave this place, to go grab cattle ♪

423
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,210
 Why are you doing this, really! 

424
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,467
♪ Tier 3, Tier 3 beef ♪ 
  (Korean Beef = hanwoo, this character's name) 

425
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:45,780
Turn it off!

426
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,730
♪ My dear friend, let us catch cattle and enjoy a fancy meal ♪

427
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,300
I said, turn it off!

428
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:04,833
You didn't act like this when Han Woo first came back. Why the fuss now?

429
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,967
I thought if it was too hard, he would give up and drop out, so I watched.

430
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:09,967
But it's becoming more and more of a spectacle.

431
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:13,533
A pasture? Animal welfare?

432
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:20,167
Do you remember the neighborhood feast when I first entered college?

433
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,767
It was worth doing.

434
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:24,700
The first one from Hana-eup to pass into Seoul National University, and it was into the law school.

435
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,600
When I gave up the civil service exam to run an inn,

436
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,100
do you remember me getting chased out of my house?

437
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,667
I even gave you a ride to the temple.

438
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,733
I still wonder...

439
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:38,733
how things would've turned out if my mom just accepted it.

440
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:40,767
Are you mocking me right now?

441
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,633
Did Han Woo ask you to take his side?

442
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,467
Honestly,

443
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:49,367
I envy you, Deok Gu.

444
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:55,333
Oh dear, I...

445
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
live without even seeing my daughter's face.

446
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,700
Even though I want to take sides,

447
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,333
I can't win against my wife.

448
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,467
No, a guy who used to dress sharply and was successful in Seoul

449
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:09,167
is just shoveling cow dung all day long now.

450
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:12,967
If I don't chase that guy away, I'll be the one getting chased away.

451
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:15,410
So that's why you're shorter than me.

452
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,133
Let go of your greed.

453
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:20,167
The best thing in life is to have your child by your side.

454
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,400
Yeah, I'm short, so what? And?

455
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,233
You've all had a hard time.

456
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,467
- You've worked hard. 
 - You've worked hard.

457
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:31,333
Oh, you two have done a great job.

458
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,933
Now, everyone have a cup of coffee.

459
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,467
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

460
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:35,700
Right, right, right.

461
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,600
Senior, today is the last day.

462
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,967
Congratulations on your discharge.

463
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:44,200
I'll be doing what I always do anyway, so we'll see each other often.

464
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,400
You said you're running a clinic in town.

465
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,667
The hospital my grandfather used to run.

466
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:50,567
Huh? Soon Ja came to sell that?

467
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,200
- What? 
 - You didn't know?

468
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,700
She even brought a broker.

469
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,933
You're buying a really good building.

470
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:03,733
Oh my, thanks to the president, I'm buying the building at a good price.

471
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:05,633
Now, we just need your son to come.

472
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:07,433
- Yes. 
 - Oh, right.

473
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,867
What are you doing right now?

474
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,200
Yeon Soo!

475
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,900
Yeon Soo, say hello, here…

476
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,833
The person buying the building, President Kim.

477
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,467
All the contracts have been written up, you know?

478
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:18,100
You just need to stamp here. Is this Yeon Soo's?

479
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,567
I'm not selling the hospital, so everyone, please leave.

480
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,867
You said it was yours.

481
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,867
Yeon Soo!

482
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,700
It's only in your name, but it's as good as mine.

483
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Didn't you hear?

484
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,567
I said please leave.

485
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:41,667
I'm sorry, there has been a misunderstanding…

486
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,667
No, I…

487
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:51,567
You figure it out. Okay?

488
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,767
Yeon Soo.

489
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:02,567
Mom, I made a promise to Grandfather,

490
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,000
that I would take care of this hospital.

491
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,433
I inherited the hospital, not just the building.

492
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,567
Why did you leave the house?

493
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:16,733
Hey, how can you live there after all that fuss? So embarrassing!

494
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:20,800
Then, at least with that money, you shouldn't have gone on a Mediterranean trip.

495
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,833
That… It's been my dream since I was young.

496
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:26,867
Mom!

497
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:28,267
So what am I supposed to do?

498
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:31,667
Should I just live out on the streets with your dad?

499
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,790
Just come live with me at my house.

500
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:42,433
Ugh, no way!

501
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:44,500
I'm a newlywed.

502
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,767
How can I live in the same house with a grown son?

503
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,700
I don't want to.

504
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,867
I'll leave.

505
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,910
You said it's yours.

506
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,333
You said it was yours!

507
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,267
Enjoy your meal.

508
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,367
Hello.

509
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:17,000
I heard about it, come on in.

510
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,133
And Mr. Chun Pil?

511
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:21,433
He's out, he will be back soon.

512
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,067
Yes.

513
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,567
It's my job.

514
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,800
Thank you.

515
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,500

 - You arrived?

523
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,000
No, no. It sounds nice. Why?

524
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,767
Oh, you're here?

525
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:29,733
What are you doing here?

526
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:31,233
I could say the same thing.

527
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,600
Say what?

528
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,433
Why are you here?

529
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:36,600
Why do you look like that?

530
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,200
Look at this one. I need to set him straight today.

531
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,800
Agree? Let's go.

532
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,580
Put your luggage there and follow me.

533
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,467
Uncle, did you see that?

534
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,233
Wow, amazing!

535
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:07,000
- Wow, it's a hit? 
 - Good! Good!

536
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:11,567
Cha Seung Eon did it.

537
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,200
- You've worked hard, Seung Eon. 
 - You've worked hard.

538
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,333
You've worked hard.

539
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:21,100
- How about more? 
 - No, it's fine. Sit down quickly.

540
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,133
Well, these are thugs.

541
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,667
Just like this, the guys who were like that...

542
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,200
- We've grown a lot, haven't we? 
 - Yes.

543
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,333
These brats used to not even know how to use a spoon. Now they do all sorts of stuff.

544
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,767
But you guys, just wait a minute…

545
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:36,733
"Gangs family," you guys don't have an older one?

546
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:39,200
You're not in touch? Try calling her.

547
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,400
Right now.

548
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,367
Were you cut off? You…

549
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,933
- I cut Kang Hee off. 
 - Which part? Your own body?

550
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:47,667
That could be… The leg might have been cut off.

551
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,933
But seeing how you can't call her, you got cut off again, didn't you?

552
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:53,233
Oh dear.

553
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:55,233
Sir, you were also cut off.

554
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,167
Probably living well, I guess.

555
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,167
Well, calling her is like…

556
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,800
Bottles up.

557
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,933
- Nana! 
 - Let's do well!

558
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:12,200
   

559
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,900
Miss Kang Hee.

560
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:20,733
Please choose a wallpaper color.

561
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:25,500
The pink you chose last time, Miss Kang Hee.

562
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,600
The clouds were a huge hit.

563
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,233
Someone posted in the review.

564
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,033
They say you don't need that medicine if you just go in there.

565
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:37,033
That pink is a bit, sensual, isn't it?

566
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,700
Ah, it's strange.

567
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
The colors chosen by Miss Kang Hee

568
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,433
seem a bit tacky at first, but strangely they catch on.

569
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,367
The photo shoots are also amazing.

570
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:48,967
How about this color?

571
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:50,600
Mountain Moose.

572
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,267
It matches the furniture well, and it seems it would make the skin tone look prettier, too.

573
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:56,867
Wow, it's perfect!

574
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:00,333
Just a moment.

575
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,833
I'm going to upload this to the website. Please take a look at the photo.

576
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,033
I like it.

577
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:09,867
The angle is good, and it looks spacious.

578
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,767
It would be nice if the temperature were adjusted.

579
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:17,380
It would seem cozier if you made the tone a bit warmer.

580
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,267
Miss Kang Hee, site survey.

581
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:25,700
Yes.

582
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,267
It seems more spacious than we anticipated, doesn't it?

583
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:35,567
Yes, the space seems well captured.

584
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:40,200
It's hot. Is it not?

585
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,100
Turn up the air conditioner a bit.

586
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,867
Is the air conditioner working or not?

587
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,433
It's coming out.

588
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:52,100
Anyway, the primary option here is to make it a business motel that mainly serves business travelers.

589
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,267
Is it possible?

590
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,567
It seems possible to have an open-front design.

591
00:45:57,567 --> 00:46:00,000
Dining room or laundry room.

592
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,633
And I'll check if there's space for luggage storage services.

593
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:04,133
Okay!

594
00:46:04,133 --> 00:46:05,900
Spicy?

595
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,633
Slightly spicy? Tastily spicy?

596
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:10,167
What was there like that…

597
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,300
Aren't you getting off?

598
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,300
What are you looking at?

599
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,000
What's the matter?

600
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,800
Excuse me.

601
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,133
Who is that man?

602
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:49,000
A classmate from my hometown.

603
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,267
"She was seen going in and out of motels," "Ji Kang Hee was already half undressed."

604
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,500
The rumors will spread far and wide, won't they?

605
00:46:58,033 --> 00:46:59,500
- Get off. 
 - Why?

606
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,100
It's not true, we have to stop it.

607
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,400
It doesn't matter.

608
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,567
I have no reason to go back to such a hometown.

609
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:08,333
Let's go.

610
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:20,000
I went to Seoul for fun today, and suddenly I got turned on.

611
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,433
So I went to a motel.

612
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:25,567
But guess who I ran into there?

613
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,933
Ji Kang Hee.

614
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,267
No, that girl…

615
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,200
She went to a motel with a man in broad daylight.

616
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,833
When the elevator doors opened,

617
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,433
a man and a woman were stuck together, just really.

618
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:38,667
That girl seemed to love it to death.

619
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,300
I knew this would happen.

620
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,100
This is why home education is important.

621
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,233
What would the daughter of a motel owner have seen growing up?

622
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,267
So what?

623
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:52,700
- What? 
 - And you? Didn't you go there, too?

624
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,733
Ha, you guys. Hey!

625
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm telling you this because I care about our friendship.

626
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,367
Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo.

627
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:04,200
You're not still thinking of getting back with Ji Kang Hee, are you?

628
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,433
Wake up from your dream.

629
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,700
Hey!

630
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,033
Hey, listen carefully.

631
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:15,300
The moment you gossip again about Kang Hee,

632
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,800
especially if I hear something terrible, you're really going to die by my hands.

633
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,933
What's the matter, really? You want to get sued again?

634
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,233
Dude, why are you making a fuss? Hey, why is this guy like this?

635
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,533
Hey, Kim Heon Yeol.

636
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:29,567
You are really like the mad cow of our house, all hell breaks loose once you're let out.

637
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:32,600
It's cleaner to bury it with an excavator.

638
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,700
It's over with just one shovel.

639
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:40,300
Hey, if you guys get reported this time, I really can't handle it.

640
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,867
Ugh, look at that loser.

641
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:45,033
Anyhow, that really is bad luck.

642
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:46,967
That's really low quality, that one.

643
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,000
Hey, hey!

644
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,800
Let's have a drink.

645
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,033
Have a drink.

646
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,900
Kang Hee…

647
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,333
Did someone really come into her life?

648
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,933
- Ah, Seung Eon. 
 - Why?

649
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,067
Can't you just shut up for a moment, really?

650
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,833
What's that, why?

651
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,900
Hey, where are you going?

652
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,767
Where is he going?

653
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:12,733
Where are you going?

654
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:14,800
To console him, thanks to you.

655
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,200
You're talking such nonsense.

656
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,400
You pay and come out.

657
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:27,933
Why did you come? Stay with Seung Eon.

658
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,067
Are you okay?

659
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:33,933
No.

660
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:41,300
So you should meet someone else, punk.

661
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,633
It's not like that.

662
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,533
Thinking it must have been hard for Kang Hee.

663
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:53,000
I feel bad for wanting her to return. It was my selfishness.

664
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,333
Hey, if you're sorry, then listen to Kang Hee for once.

665
00:49:57,333 --> 00:50:00,833
Hey, Ji Kang Hee said let's live well separately.

666
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,633
So let go of Kang Hee now, please?

667
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,267
What is it, you?

668
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,433
Why aren't you talking back?

669
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:14,600
I'm going in first.

670
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,600
I have a meeting.

671
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,300
What would have happened if I hadn't scouted Deputy Ji?

672
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,267
What? I was the one who made Ms. Kang Hee join.

673
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:35,200
I was the one who snapped her up from the field.

674
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,300
I was the one who picked Ms. Kang Hee's design.

675
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,367
No, it wasn't.

676
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,867
Ms. Kang Hee joined because of me.

677
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:42,900
Wanna bet?

678
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,100
Then, 100,000 won, even.

679
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:54,533
Take 100,000 won, and add another 100,000 won.

680
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,900
Are you joking?

681
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,633
All in!

682
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,533
If you're scared, go on in.

683
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,067
Shall we give it a try?

684
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,567
All-in!

685
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,333
All-in!

686
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,700
We are in the midst of a stake fight right now, you know?

687
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,433
Kang Hee, please sort this out.

688
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:22,267
When I sent the 50 million won to you.

689
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:23,933
That swayed your heart, right?

690
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:28,367
Not a chance. It was the proposal I made when you came to return that money, wasn't it?

691
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:33,267
It was me who made the drastic proposal, wasn't it?

692
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,833
Thanks to Coach Esther.

693
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,833
 You said you rejected the job offer, right? 

694
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,300
 If you've come to persuade me… you're wasting your time. 

695
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:51,800
 No? I came to commend you for doing well. 

696
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,933
 I'm an expert at this kind of thing. 

697
00:51:55,933 --> 00:52:00,533
 Even when I started a business with Seok Kyeong, I was the one who secured all the investments. 

698
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:05,267
 I'd like to return the favor for the wedding gift… how about now? 

699
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:06,900
 What do you think 

700
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,067
 Kang Hee, would you like to comfortably talk about 

701
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:14,100
 the things you want to accomplish through work? 

702
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,367
 Someday, 

703
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:24,133
 I want to have my own company. 

704
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,533
 A company with my name on it. 

705
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:30,967
 And? 

706
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,133
 Near the company, 

707
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,767
 I want to have my own space. 

708
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:40,633
 Not a goshiwon or a semi-basement… but a space of my own. 

709
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,833
 A space of my own. 

710
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:46,633
 - And? 
 - What more could I ask for? 

711
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:50,933
 If it comes to that… I might as well sell my soul to the devil. 

712
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:56,200
 Would you perhaps be willing to receive an investment? 

713
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,133
 Who would invest in me? 

714
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,433
 When receiving an investment, 

715
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:03,767
 do you know what the hardest part is? 

716
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:07,967
 Finding someone who recognizes my value. 

717
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,967
 Kang Hee, you've already met them. 

718
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:14,000
 CEO Hwang Jeong Goo has a good reputation in the industry. 

719
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,533
 Geum Seok Kyeong, I vouch for him. He has ample financial resources. Above all, 

720
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,600
 it's a company that would believe in our potential. 

721
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,233
 Ji Kang Hee and I, together, hand in hand. 

722
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:32,267
 Let's join forces and conquer the motel industry once and for all. 

723
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:44,000
You were behind all of that?

724
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,500
And you haven't said a word to me about it until now?

725
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,700
If you two are the Hwang-Geum line,

726
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,133
shall we say we're the Park-Ji line?

727
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:57,500
Let's split the dividends in half.

728
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,700
Now, having received the dividends, shall we get inspired to work?

729
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,233
What did you call me for?

730
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:09,033
Can you go as the site manager for our company's branding project?

731
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,067
Thank you!

732
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:15,300
I will really, really work hard.

733
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,900
Loyalty!

734
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,633
Where is the site?

735
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,167
You might not know it, it's called Hana-eup.

736
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:27,267
Where did you say?

737
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,000
Hana-eup.

738
00:54:39,967 --> 00:54:41,833
- Just a little bit lower. 
 - Yes.

739
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,870
Okay, it seems like gastroenteritis.

740
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,030
The cause is often stress.

741
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:50,633
In the case of acute gastroenteritis, it could be due to eating something bad.

742
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:53,000
Director, a phone call.

743
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,933
Yes, sir.

744
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:00,500
Ah, is that so? Yes.

745
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,067
Yes, I will go right away.

746
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:04,500
Yes, please wait a moment.

747
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,767
- Ms. Yoon, I need to go to the birth of a calf. 
 - Yes.

748
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,900
You know the snacks we usually give animals.

749
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,767
Never share with this one from now on, okay?

750
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,233
Yes.

751
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:14,700
   

752
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,000
Doctor, have a safe trip.

753
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:24,300
Will you stop avoiding me?

754
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,833
Avoiding? Since when did I do that?

755
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:29,133
I'll double the incentive if you go to Hana-eup.

756
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:32,367
I'll just take the penalty instead.

757
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:36,067
Are you really going to be like this? Let's talk.

758
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,033
I have a date, I need to go now.

759
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:40,067
I'll have my phone off, so don't look for me.

760
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,767
You know I'm on monthly leave from tomorrow, right?

761
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:43,500
I'm going.

762
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,367
Why is that?

763
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:55,500
She said it's a date.

764
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:59,233
- A date? 
 - Yes.

765
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,067
Ah Reum.

766
00:56:17,067 --> 00:56:19,500
Hey!

767
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:23,400
How did you get here?

768
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:31,700
I will, I'll carry it for you. Just a moment.

769
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,667
Hello! Wow, you have a lot of luggage.

770
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,633
It so happens I have a cart in my car.

771
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,667
Please, wait a moment.

772
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,933
- Who is it? 
 - A company employee.

773
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,400
- Did you follow me? 
 - No.

774
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,067
I live next door.

775
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:50,300
You live next door?

776
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,600
Because it's the company dormitory.

777
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,900
Hey, dormitory? At such an expensive place?

778
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,133
Our company has a lot of money.

779
00:56:57,133 --> 00:57:00,167
Hey, what does your company actually do?

780
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:06,767
What?

781
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:15,333
Wow, it's so beautiful!

782
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:18,733
Hey, what is this?

783
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:22,900
Oh, my! Wow, goodness!

784
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,333
Ah Reum, look at that.

785
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:29,700
I designed this. It's in the magazine.

786
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,133
Really? Wow, that's cool!

787
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:36,367
Is this a company business card?

788
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:38,633
Hgpj?

789
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:41,967
This J is for Ji Kang Hee's.

790
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:44,500
Hwang-Geum-Park-Ji.

791
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,733
Hwang Jeong Goo, Geum Seok Kyeong, Park Esther, Ji Kang Hee.

792
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:51,567
Hey, so this is your company?

793
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:54,767
You could say I'm sort of a founding member.

794
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:57,133
I have a small stake in it, too.

795
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,467
Goodness!

796
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:03,500
Wow, I think I'm really going to cry!

797
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,167
Just a moment.

798
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:18,900
Have this with your friend.

799
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,133
If you need anything else, just let me know.

800
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:25,033
If your friend wants to tour Seoul, my car…

801
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:27,000
We'll take good care of it.

802
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,400
- Just a second… 
 - Ah, thank you, take care.

803
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,367
- Aren't I going in? 
 - Ah, yes, yes.

804
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:35,167
- Your friend… 
 - Have a good day.

805
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,800
Hey, that guy likes you, right?

806
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,600
He likes me? Really?

807
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,520
Yeah.

808
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,500
I didn't know.

809
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,933
Hey!

810
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:54,433
Have you heard any rumors lately? About me.

811
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:55,733
What rumor?

812
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,500
Kim Heon Yeol didn't say anything?

813
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:01,067
That can't be right.

814
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,800
Disappointed? Want me to spread a rumor?

815
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,133
A fabulous guy lives next door to Kang Hee?

816
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:09,800
The guy next door is dying for Kang Hee?

817
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,200
Go ahead, spread it.

818
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,967
All right.

819
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,900
I'm not going back to that neighborhood anyway,

820
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,633
whether the rumor spreads or not.

821
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,433
It's a relief.

822
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,933
You and Yeon Soo both met nice people.

823
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:26,700
Yeon Soo...

824
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,167
met someone?

825
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:34,167
That…

826
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:37,300
A junior from the same school.

827
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,933
Ah.

828
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:42,967
It's looking like he'll get married soon.

829
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,033
I see...

830
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,367
Ah, that's right! I brought this.

831
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:54,167
My mom's homemade fresh kimchi.

832
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:57,200
Mom really said she wouldn't make it, but…

833
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,767
But when I told her it was for you, she made it right away.

834
00:59:59,767 --> 01:00:01,767
Anyone want kimchi?

835
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,833
Me!

836
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:10,000
First, the seasoning will be really delicious.

837
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,767
Fresh leafy mustard goes in… either sand lance sauce or anchovy sauce.

838
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:15,833
Senior!

839
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:17,700
Oh, Ms. Yoon.

840
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,133
Uh, do you drive?

841
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:28,067
No, it's been a while since I got my license… I need to take the driving course again.

842
01:00:28,067 --> 01:00:30,167
Oh, is that so?

843
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:33,067
While I'm not here, you might need to travel alone,

844
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:34,500
and there might be a lot of emergencies.

845
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,267
Take some training when you have time.

846
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,367
Can't you give me the driving training?

847
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:46,700
It would work if you train me.

848
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:52,100
Sorry, I don't have a car.

849
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,967
Oh, why not?

850
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:57,100
Why don't you train me? Please do it.

851
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,560
Please do it.

852
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:01,600
I'll do it, later. Later, right?

853
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,033
Okay, you're doing well.

854
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,967
But shall we speed up a bit?

855
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,500
- Speed? 
 - Yes.

856
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,567
- Just press it gently. 
 - Fast?

857
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:22,700
Yes, just a little.

858
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:27,733
Oh, but I see a car over there.

859
01:01:27,733 --> 01:01:29,533
- What should I do? 
 - Oh, it's okay.

860
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:31,700
- Now, stay calm, and… 
 - Yes.

861
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:36,000
Tap the brake lightly and… just move a little to the right.

862
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,400
- Yes. 
 - Yes, lightly.

863
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,367
Brake! Brake!

864
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:46,300
No, you have to press the brake! What are you doing?

865
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:49,833
Brake, not the accelerator!

866
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:51,367
Right, right! Brake.

867
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,800
Brake, to the right!

868
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:06,667
Are you okay? You're not hurt, right?

869
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:14,700
The car is fine, so just stay put.

870
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,433
Don't get out.

871
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:24,967
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

872
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,800
Get in the passenger seat, I'll drive.

873
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:38,567
I can't get out, senior.

874
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:41,567
Okay.

875
01:02:42,433 --> 01:02:44,767
Get out carefully.

876
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:46,433
Watch your step.

877
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:48,500
Be careful.

878
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:14,140


879
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:30,000
♫  What if I was wrong apart from my everything  ♫

880
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,640
♫  Don't force me to hurt because of my feelings for you  ♫

881
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:47,070
♫  Forgive me, my dear, for running into you for a while  ♫

882
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:55,440
♫  You told me about your everything, your whispers are all my favorite thing  ♫

883
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,150
♫  I think I fell in love with you  ♫

884
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:02,880
♫  But how can I forget you?  ♫

885
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,580
♫  You stayed close in the everyday  ♫

886
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,340
 The daughter of a motel owner came to renovate the motel. 

887
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,370
 My father was a motel owner. 

888
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,610
 Where does he run his motel? 

889
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,560
 I thought he passed away when you were ten.  

890
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,750
 This is the most important part. Please don't call me by my name. 

891
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,280
 - Dear owner. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - You're the owner of this project. 

892
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,830
 Ji Kang Hee got drunk drinking four bottles all by herself.  

893
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:28,120
 I don't deserve to come back to Yeon Soo... 

894
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:33,090
 - That teddy bear didn't keep any of the promises he made to me. 
 - Don't leave...
