1
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,820
Ah! You startled me!

2
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:42,169
Ice cream? You don't usually eat ice cream.

3
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:44,169
Because there's someone to buy it for.

4
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,602
What's this? I caught you right there.

5
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:47,769
Who is it?

6
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,102
Then, will you buy me one too?

7
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:52,502
I mean, I like ice cream too.

8
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:54,102
Alright, then.

9
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:57,669
Yay! Ice cream!

10
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:59,736
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,036
Wow! That looks delicious!

12
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:03,036
Director, what would you like to have?

13
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:08,036
- I'll take one of these in the family size.
- Yes.

14
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,736
This one?

15
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,936
A provocative flavor?

16
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,969
Why are you like this?

17
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,169
Ah, what should I have?

18
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:37,502
<i>I really can't live like this.</i>

19
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:43,202
<i>What a waste of a fine-looking person.
Live your life straight.</i>

20
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:46,436
<i>Let go! Who do you think you are? Who are you?</i>

21
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:50,077
<i>I'm the wife of the man you took to a motel!
What are you going to do about it?</i>

22
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>You're dead!</i>

23
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,436
<i>Let go!</i>

24
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:58,236
<i>Hey, leave! Take your husband and go!</i>

25
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,302
<i>You scammer, go away!</i>

26
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,836
<i>It hurts, really!</i>

27
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:03,702
<i>Love isn't a crime, is it?</i>

28
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:06,136
<i>What are you saying? You!</i>

29
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:08,636
<i>Please stop! Yes. Okay!</i>

30
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:27,036
<i>Kang Hee, shall we go for ice cream?</i>

31
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,736
<i>Can I have a double?</i>

32
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,602
<i>No, you can have a double-double.</i>

33
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,936
<i>Then I'll have Shooting Star.</i>

34
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,402
<i>I'll take mint chocolate chip.</i>

35
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:41,802
<i>One is…</i>

36
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,502
<i>Chocolate?</i>

37
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,102
<i>Walnut?</i>

38
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,369
<i>Oh, I can't choose.</i>

39
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,069
<i>Then, choose four flavors you'd like to have.</i>

40
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,669
<i>You should have mint chocolate chip.</i>

41
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:00,502
<i>- It's okay.
- Dummy.</i>

42
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:02,236
<i>Okay.</i>

43
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:04,502
<i>I'll take walnut.</i>

44
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,336
<i>And you?</i>

45
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:10,202
<i>I'll have two mint chocolate chips.</i>

46
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,036
<i>Don't eat ice cream with anyone else.</i>

47
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:28,602
<i>But after soccer, I always eat with the guys.</i>

48
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,236
<i>Not like that.</i>

49
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,702
<i>Only eat Berry Scoop with me.</i>

50
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:35,136
<i>Then you too, only eat with me.</i>

51
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:36,702
<i>You promise first.</i>

52
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,536
<i>I don't want to. You're just
going to make me do it again.</i>

53
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,436
<i>Ah, come on!</i>

54
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,836
<i>Hurry!</i>

55
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:51,369
<i>Ah, really!</i>

56
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,669
<i>It's a promise!</i>

57
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,036
This one is good, and that's good too.

58
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,402
I'll have the chocolate flavor, please.

59
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:01,202
Yes, I'll help you with the payment first.

60
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,536
- Please wrap it separately.
- Yes.

61
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,969
Bad guy.

62
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,902
You punk.

63
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:24,169
<i>Okay.</i>

64
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,936
<i>From now on, even just the ice cream
or Berry Scoop,</i>

65
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:30,036
<i>I'll eat it only with you.</i>

66
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,936
<i>- Okay.
- Is that settled?</i>

67
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,669
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,402
<i>But,</i>

69
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,869
<i>- you play soccer?
- Yeah</i>

70
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,836
<i>The kids let me be the goalkeeper.</i>

71
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,536
<i>I did well, right?</i>

72
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:49,202
You punk.

73
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:53,969
Who's the punk you're talking about?

74
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:15,769
<i>You will look at someone else with those eyes.</i>

75
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,702
<i>You will call someone else with that voice.</i>

76
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,836
<i>You will hold someone else in your heart.</i>

77
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:31,569
Kang Hee, why are you crying?

78
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,736
You changed.

79
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,236
And you changed a lot.

80
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,069
Kang Hee.

81
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:50,136
Don't follow me.

82
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,769
I know you are there.

83
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,902
You saw it.

84
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:09,602
You saw me crying all the way.

85
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:14,469
Are you really not coming
just because I told you not to?

86
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,469
Clueless teddy bear.

87
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:21,569
<i>Kang Hee.</i>

88
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:23,402
<i>Hey, Ji Kang Hee.</i>

89
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,536
<i>If you go now,</i>

90
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:30,702
<i>I won't wait anymore.</i>

91
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,069
<i>That's what I've been hoping for.</i>

92
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,736
<i>Our first love ends here.</i>

93
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,502
<i>The end.</i>

94
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:41,502
<i>Are you serious?</i>

95
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,536
<i>Thank you for liking me all this time.</i>

96
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:07,102
First love, the end.

97
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,402
Serves you right for acting all high
and mighty, Ji Kang Hee.

98
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:15,902
You're the one who said it's over.
Why are you crying?

99
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,702
I told you not to follow me.

100
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,402
Go!

101
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:50,069
It's expensive, a limited edition.

102
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:51,836
"Make sure you return it".

103
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:54,702
I was going to say that, but it suits you well.

104
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,569
It's not easy to find something
that suits me better than this.

105
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:00,302
Just take it, Kang Hee.

106
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,036
- Can you see well?
- No, I can't see.

107
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,769
Let's go together.

108
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,202
What? You can see properly.

109
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:21,169
Don't follow me.

110
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:46,402
Please make sure to only give this to Kang Hee.

111
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:55,536
Kkam Hee,

112
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:58,736
Kang Hee was the only one who could console me.

113
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:02,169
But not anymore.

114
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:09,802
Why did Kang Hee cry?

115
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,969
You're asking if I asked?

116
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,336
She said I changed, a lot.

117
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,569
I'm still the same though.

118
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:27,869
What exactly has changed?

119
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:36,069
What? Cheon Yeon Soo, were you in your room?

120
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,702
Hey, put this on and follow me to the rooftop.

121
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,169
What is all this?

122
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,802
Ah, I don't know, Mr. Chun Pil

123
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:47,002
wanted us to wear one each
and then gather on the rooftop.

124
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,036
Today is a bit…

125
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:52,102
It's Kang Hee's welcome party.
Are you planning to skip it?

126
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:55,969
You know how he really likes welcome
or launch ceremonies, all that stuff.

127
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:59,702
So he was saying we should have one
with the family members.

128
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:03,402
Ah Reum grabbed the opportunity
and even had uniforms made.

129
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:05,002
So, now it has come to this.

130
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:06,536
Let's ride along with it, okay?

131
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:09,802
Pretend like we worked hard on it,
you know the feeling?

132
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,069
Come on. You'll end up being
the most enthusiastic once you're there.

133
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:14,936
Come up.

134
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:17,202
The carpet?

135
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:18,669
What carpet?

136
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:20,602
Red carpet.

137
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,436
Why don't you ask?

138
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,236
Can I ask?

139
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:34,969
There's no guarantee of an answer, though.

140
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,036
No, I need to hear it.

141
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,369
It's a very important issue to me.

142
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,569
What is it?

143
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:43,736
From today onwards, we

144
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,602
don't have to look for accommodations, right?

145
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:50,536
We'll be staying at Motel California.

146
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,769
Was that what you were going to ask?

147
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:56,136
Yes, why?

148
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,369
Like, "why did you cry?"

149
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:02,102
"Why didn't you say
Motel California is your home?"

150
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:05,036
"Why did you say your perfectly
alive father had passed away?"

151
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,902
"Why do you call him Chun Pil?"…

152
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,636
You expected to be asked that?

153
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:15,569
Why ask things that you
would not want to talk about?

154
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,302
I'll find out on my own.

155
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:24,636
The moment you find out,
you'll distance yourself from me.

156
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:29,869
Because I hate men who know my past.

157
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,002
That's right.

158
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:38,202
How did you get here?

159
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,769
No, nothing happened.

160
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:42,536
- Nothing at all?
- No incidents or accidents.

161
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:48,036
Hey, Ji Kang Hee.

162
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:51,702
When did you arrive
that I'm only seeing your face now?

163
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,236
Kang Hee, get behind me.

164
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:57,502
Since Ji Kang Hee needs to rest today,
due to heavy workload,

165
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,836
please come back another time…

166
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,402
What heavy workload?

167
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,269
You were going on about interior design,

168
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,069
are you really the heir to the Elitree Hotel?

169
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,502
I've seen it all, a Seoul man escorting
manual laborers at construction sites.

170
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,636
- It's not manual labor, it's the supervisor.
- Then…

171
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:16,269
Let's take the questions one at a time, please.

172
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,836
Starting with me.

173
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:19,569
What do you mean by gangster?

174
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,802
So why do you call
Kang Hee's friends gangsters?

175
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,336
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

176
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,869
I'm back.

177
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,536
Kang Hee,

178
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,602
everyone is waiting.

179
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:36,736
For me?

180
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:39,036
Who?

181
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,436
<i>[Nice to see you, Kang Hee.
Isn't it great to reunite?]</i>

182
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:43,436
Wow! There's really a lot of beer.

183
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,336
Hey!

184
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:46,969
Should I help you?

185
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,836
Let's get ready, now.

186
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,702
Kang Hee should like it though.

187
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,669
Ah Reum and Seung Eon stand over there.

188
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:54,936
Come here.

189
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,136
Here.

190
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,336
Hey, but shouldn't her father also be here?

191
00:13:58,336 --> 00:13:59,636
<i>[Welcome]</i>

192
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:00,869
<i>[Hee Kang]</i>

193
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,436
Maybe not? Right?

194
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:04,902
Because it's Kang Hee's house.

195
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:06,536
Pose.

196
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,169
Ah, what is it?

197
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,302
Let's go together, Ms. Kang Hee.

198
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:20,736
Who are you?

199
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,502
I'm Kwon.

200
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,936
Well…

201
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,402
Not just the surname, full name please.

202
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:29,902
It is Mr. Kwon.

203
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:32,836
Mr. Kwon.

204
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:36,102
I'd like my room on an
upper floor as well, please.

205
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:38,336
It's the family floor.

206
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:43,302
It seems you don't know,
but I'm practically family too.

207
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:47,769
Kang Hee and I are like family
eating from the same pot, okay?

208
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,702
Your family members…

209
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,902
Manager!

210
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:02,236
Let's go out and buy some food,
as we are family who share meals.

211
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,402
I'll give you my card.

212
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,602
No. No need!

213
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:07,402
- Manager!
- Let's go out to eat. Let's go out.

214
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:08,669
Mr. Manager!

215
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,369
What's about this sweater?

216
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,969
Huh? Sweater?

217
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:15,036
Your cronies call this a team uniform.

218
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,802
They got it all right and even had
me put it on. Go upstairs and look.

219
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:20,569
All your cronies are gathered there.

220
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,736
<i>[Welcome, Kang Hee! Isn't it nice to reunite?]</i>

221
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:35,902
<i>[Kang Hee, welcome back to Hana-eup!]</i>

222
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,769
<i>[Welcome Hee Kang]</i>

223
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,036
What is this?

224
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:44,469
Congratulations on your comeback
to Hana-eup, Ji Kang Hee!

225
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,169
Hey, you've got it reversed!

226
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,402
- Hey, you should have told me!
- It's ruined.

227
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:51,702
You are "Kang" and I am "Hee".

228
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,169
If Mr. Chun Pil had come too,
it would be "Hee Kang Ji"!

229
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,902
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

230
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,802
So, now, shall we give it a try and eat?

231
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,402
What is that?

232
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,136
This?

233
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,702
Do you want to try this?

234
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:17,036
It's the famous Sriracha sauce from Thailand.

235
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:18,069
The spiciness is delicious.

236
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,902
- It's good?
- Yes.

237
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:06,569
<i>It says "son of a dog", "son of a dog".</i>

238
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,136
<i>[I'm a son of a dog, woof woof.]</i>

239
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:13,136
<i>[I'm a piglet, oink oink.]</i>

240
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,836
<i>If you bully Cheon Yeon Soo</i>

241
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:24,669
<i>whoever it is, I will pay back the same way.</i>

242
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,302
<i>Got it?</i>

243
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:35,002
<i>One, two, faster! One, two, one, two.</i>

244
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,236
<i>Faster! One, two, one, two.</i>

245
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,869
<i>Hold on.</i>

246
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:42,902
<i>Why do I have to do this?</i>

247
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,736
<i>There's no such thing
as a free lunch in this world.</i>

248
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,102
<i>I saved you, didn't I?</i>

249
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,836
<i>I don't know, I can't anymore.</i>

250
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:53,502
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo! Cheon Yeon Soo!</i>

251
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:57,036
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo! Cheon Yeon Soo!</i>

252
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:00,536
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo! Cheon Yeon Soo!</i>

253
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:04,236
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo, well done.</i>

254
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:07,069
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo! Cheon…</i>

255
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,169
<i>Again!</i>

256
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,969
<i>Can't go home today until it's done.</i>

257
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:33,002
<i>Good job! That's right!
As expected, I was right. Well done!</i>

258
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,036
<i>Number 1.</i>

259
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:36,002
<i>- Number 2.
- Number 3.</i>

260
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,202
<i>Number 4.</i>

261
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,936
<i>- Fighting!
- Fighting!</i>

262
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:43,236
<i>- Win, Kang Hee team!
- Win, Heon Yeol team!</i>

263
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:46,736
<i>- Win, Kang Hee team!
- Win, Heon Yeol team!</i>

264
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:50,769
<i>- Win, Kang Hee team!
- Win, Heon Yeol team!</i>

265
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,902
<i>Kang Hee team, win!</i>

266
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,269
<i>Kang Hee team, lose!</i>

267
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:03,236
<i>- Heon Yeol team, win!
- Cheon Yeon Soo, come quickly!</i>

268
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:06,069
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo, quickly!</i>

269
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:27,002
<i>Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo!</i>

270
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,902
<i>Line up properly.</i>

271
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,469
<i>Are you a gangster too?</i>

272
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,536
<i>- Not really.
- What do you mean you're not?</i>

273
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:37,202
<i>Kang Hee's gang, they are gangsters.</i>

274
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:41,736
<i>It's not a gang, it's a family!</i>

275
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:46,502
<i>Yeon Soo, we are going to eat red bean bread.
Do you want to come with us?</i>

276
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,136
<i>Yes.</i>

277
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:04,669
<i>To that treasure chest. The first
person to get there is number one!</i>

278
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,902
<i>- First place!
- Second place!</i>

279
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:10,669
<i>Third place!</i>

280
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,102
<i>Hey, everyone, gather around.</i>

281
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,702
<i>Ah.</i>

282
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:56,569
<i>Is it that delicious?</i>

283
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:57,702
<i>Yes.</i>

284
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:59,736
<i>I want to do it too, gangster.</i>

285
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,902
<i>That's right, number 3.</i>

286
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:02,936
<i>Number 3?</i>

287
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,036
<i>I am number 1.</i>

288
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,702
<i>I am number 2.</i>

289
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:08,702
<i>Number 3 is the best for Cheon Yeon Soo.</i>

290
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,769
<i>Look.</i>

291
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,369
<i>Number one, three syllables.</i>

292
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,802
<i>Number two, three syllables.</i>

293
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,502
<i>Number three,</i>

294
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,436
<i>you are the only one with four syllables.</i>

295
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:20,169
<i>It's special.</i>

296
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:22,736
<i>Number three?</i>

297
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:24,502
<i>Right?</i>

298
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,902
Ah, garlic!

299
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:41,269
Everyone has grown a lot.

300
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,802
What are you talking about?

301
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,302
He was always calling himself the boss.

302
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,636
Ah, I don't know. I can't remember. And,

303
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,536
these days, it's Cha Seung Eon who's the boss.

304
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:52,102
He's the one who earns the most money among us.

305
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,769
I heard he even gives
pocket money to your father.

306
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:55,702
Ah? What pocket money?

307
00:21:55,702 --> 00:21:59,002
He cried while releasing the cattle
at the Hanwoo farm.

308
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,002
He really became a man, right?

309
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:04,336
Who says I cried? I mean,
it's not that I cried, so, well…

310
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:09,069
Now I finally realize why I'm called Han Woo!

311
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,836
I didn't cry.

312
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:13,469
Have some shrimp too.

313
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:16,502
How did my dad decide to name me Han Woo?

314
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:22,069
Why did he name me that way?

315
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:24,469
Yeon Soo, how about you?

316
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,269
Are you doing well?

317
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:29,902
Is the hospital doing well?

318
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:31,602
Just…

319
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,002
It's fun.

320
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:38,469
I inherited the hospital from Grandpa,
but there's also a sense of fulfillment.

321
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:42,136
You could say he's Hana-eup's top guy.

322
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:45,402
Just how many animals
is Yeon Soo responsible for?

323
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,769
But Cheon Yeon Soo is really lucky.

324
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,202
You did your apprenticeship here, too.

325
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,802
Right?

326
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,769
How about you, Ah Reum?

327
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,569
Are you still writing poetry?

328
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:10,536
What does it matter? Everyone knows anyway.

329
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:16,102
Yeah, even when you used to work many jobs,
pretending to be refined and writing poetry.

330
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,836
I wasn't pretending to be refined.

331
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,569
And you, Kang Hee? How have you been doing?

332
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:29,669
Me? Well…

333
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:38,736
Hey, I should get going. I'll leave first.

334
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,669
Hey, Kang Hee. Then, I'll go with you.

335
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,736
- I'll take you.
- No.

336
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,869
You need to clean up here.

337
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,469
This and that, clean it all, right?

338
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:55,669
Ah, right. Then I'll tidy this up.

339
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,802
Hey, Han Woo, can you help Seung Eon a bit?

340
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:01,169
Let's go, Ah Reum. I'll take you.

341
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,169
- Go.
- Going?

342
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:09,036
Cutting off like this?

343
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,236
What's going on, Ms. Ah Reum? Leaving me out?

344
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:35,836
I'm sorry, Manager. I was invited too.

345
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:39,736
Kang Hee, I'll go ahead
with Yeon Soo. You stay here.

346
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:42,136
Let's go.

347
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,869
I heard it was a welcoming party for you.

348
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:48,102
Must have been nice.

349
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:51,502
Not at all.

350
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:55,302
I'm going for a walk.

351
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:10,602
Ah, it was not me, actually.

352
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,602
Good work!

353
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:22,569
Are you resenting me right now?

354
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,969
You came out following Kang Hee.
My offering you a ride was just an excuse.

355
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,602
Then did you do it on purpose, knowing that?

356
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,636
There's the guy with Kang Hee, too.

357
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:42,169
Once the construction is finished,
she'll go back to Seoul.

358
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:45,869
If you get shaken,

359
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:48,336
how can we just watch you struggle?

360
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:55,669
I have to do well on the construction.

361
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:59,136
All of a sudden? You are already doing well.

362
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,469
I ran away from here when
I was 20 years old, you know?

363
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:06,736
I went to the capital without any plan.

364
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:10,102
Moving from one exam prep room to another,

365
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,136
working two or three part-time jobs a day.

366
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:19,469
When I got my college diploma
with my own effort,

367
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:24,936
although it was a community college,
I was happy to make it to first base.

368
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:28,502
After I got a job,

369
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:34,602
when I received a business card
with "Ji Kang Hee" engraved on it,

370
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:38,902
I felt proud because it seemed
like I had reached second base.

371
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:42,669
What I mean is,

372
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,736
I've also lived diligently.

373
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:49,569
I know, I am the witness.

374

375
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,902
and work passionately as a designer.

376
00:26:56,902 --> 00:27:01,502
But seeing my childhood friends today,

377
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:09,036
why I felt like I was the only loser?

378
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:13,302
Everyone seems to be living well here
without any problems.

379
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,402
I couldn't bear it and ran away.

380
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,469
It wasn't running away, it was a challenge.

381
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:22,902
Maybe all the friends are envious too, right?

382
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,169

386

00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,636
<i>Right? Am I wrong?</i>

528
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,636
<i>After rejecting the mayor's daughter,
the county governor's daughter,</i>

529
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:08,936
<i>he ended up involved with some girl
of unknown background.</i>

530
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,502
<i>Look at that, that! Look at those eyes!</i>

531
00:37:11,502 --> 00:37:12,836
<i>Kids, just go. Hurry up and go.</i>

532
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:16,536
<i>- Kang Hee, let's go.
- Ah, let me go.</i>

533
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:19,369
<i>Chun Pil's mother also passed
away because of that.</i>

534
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:20,869
<i>She died mad with anger.</i>

535
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:23,569
<i>Ji Kang Hee even drove her
own grandmother insane!</i>

536
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,036
<i>You're saying all sorts of things to the kid.</i>

537
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,336
<i>What? Am I wrong?</i>

538
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:28,502
<i>No, stop it. Just stop!</i>

539
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:32,002
<i>Where did this…</i>

540
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,802
<i>What is this?</i>

541
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:38,936
<i>Goodness, what is it?</i>

542
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:40,302
<i>Hey, you, Ji Kang Hee!</i>

543
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:41,602
<i>Aren't you going to open the door?</i>

544
00:37:41,602 --> 00:37:43,602
<i>Come here, you rascal!</i>

545
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,669
<i>Sticking out your tongue? I'm going to…</i>

546
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:47,469
<i>Come here! Goodbye?</i>

547
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:48,569
<i>Hey, Kang Hee!</i>

548
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:51,069
<i>I need to poop!</i>

549
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:04,002
Sir.

550
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:09,936
You know about the festival, right?

551
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,069
- Yes.
- Then,

552
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,869
did you know that the traffic
is also being controlled up ahead?

553
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:18,336
Our cows in Hana-eup

554
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:20,869
are of very good breed.

555
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:25,602
These cows need to travel safely.

556
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:28,402
But we need a concrete mixer
truck to come in that day.

557
00:38:28,402 --> 00:38:31,536
You don't need to report everything to me.

558
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,769
How about

559
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,769
we solve our own things ourselves?

560
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,302
- Excuse me?
- I'm now

561
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:41,602
doing well with the festival work.

562
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:45,636
And you are fully committed
to the construction.

563
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:47,936
So, Ms. Kang Hee…

564
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:56,036
Do you realize how hard she is trying to meet

565
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,602
the opening date?

566
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,302
Yes.

567
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:07,702
He only knows one thing, not the other.

568
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:11,236
It seems like he doesn't know anything at all.

569
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:17,836
Hey, are you Ji Kang Hee?

570
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:19,802
Hello.

571
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:23,002
Good to see you.

572
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:24,569
First, just apologize.

573
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:28,069
When I think about how I suffered
being locked in the warehouse because of you,

574
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,202
it angers me to the point
where I wake up abruptly while sleeping.

575
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:34,669
Oh dear, why did I do that?

576
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:37,269
You were always disrespectful
since you were young.

577
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:40,302
Talking back to elders
and always getting into trouble.

578
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:42,436
Ah, sir, that's enough.

579
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:43,536
It's all in the past.

580
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,636
Past? Look at this.

581
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,869
What about the trauma?

582
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,002
Compensate me.

583
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:54,336
Didn't you get a wealthy boyfriend?

584
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:57,302
Not my boyfriend, but my company's manager.

585
00:39:57,302 --> 00:39:58,969
Whatever.

586
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:02,602
You have to compensate first, if you want
to do construct in this neighborhood.

587
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:06,436
Go and try to persuade him well.

588
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:10,469
Sir, please think it over.

589
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:12,736
I will apologize, alright?

590
00:40:12,736 --> 00:40:15,669
Am I supposed to kneel down?

591
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:18,469
Oh, right, that sounds good.

592
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:20,069
Try kneeling. Let's see.

593
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:22,236
It seems too precious to be seen alone.

594
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:24,102
Then, how about this?

595
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:26,836
If you gather all the festival
preparation committee members,

596
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:31,369
I will go to that place and kneel
down and apologize right away.

597
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:34,602
Do both that and separately.

598
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:35,836
Hurry and kneel down!

599
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,369
If you contact them first…

600
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:40,169
Kneel down quickly! Don't try to resist.

601
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:42,536
Stop it, sir.

602
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:47,269
If you do that, whether it's an apology
or compensation, it should be done by you.

603
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,969
Don't you remember what you
said to Kang Hee back then?

604
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:53,636
What did I do?

605
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:55,136
Come.

606
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:56,802
You…

607
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:59,236
Oh, you guys, really!

608
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:05,436
Kang Hee.

609
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:08,436
What are you doing? I'm working right now.

610
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:10,236
You don't have to do this.

611
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:11,902
I'll collect all the consent forms.

612
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,669
- You…
- Why?

613
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:16,602
Why are you helping me? By what right?

614
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:23,069
I've survived in Seoul for 10 years
starting from the bottom.

615
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:27,769
I've been through all kinds of tough times,
and there were people worse than that.

616
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,502
Sorry. I'm sorry, Kang Hee.

617
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:34,069
Do you have anything to do with me?

618
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:38,036
You should have just
ignored it, just walked on by.

619
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,136
I know everything.

620
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:44,169
How can I pretend not to know?

621
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,102
How could I just stay silent?

622
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:49,969
I hate it! That's why I hate it.

623
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:54,436
Because you know all about my dark past
and my wounds. That's why…

624
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:05,269
it hurts to see you.

625
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:13,236
<i>Why did we have to meet like this?</i>

626
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:17,369
<i>I didn't want to show you this side of me.</i>

627
00:42:26,202 --> 00:42:28,469
Oh, manager.

628
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:30,669
It's all taken care of, right?

629
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:32,602
There are people here.

630
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,469
What about the wire mesh work?

631
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,236
<i>[Wire Mesh: Strengthen structures by a metal mesh]</i>
We're on it, trust the person in charge.

632
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:39,402
What about the manager?

633
00:42:39,402 --> 00:42:42,369
He left a while ago, for a phone call?

634
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:47,036
It's been resolved.

635
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:50,002
- What?
- Traffic control.

636
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:51,702
They said it's been lifted.

637
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,769
Really?

638
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:55,869
Ah, this turned out well.
As expected from Manager Geum.

639
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:59,469
How?

640
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:02,469
Well… I happen to be quite persuasive.

641
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:05,536
And I tend to be particularly likable, too.

642
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:09,236
There's no way
they would have agreed so easily.

643
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:12,769
Countryside folks aren't so easily swayed.

644
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:16,069
- Especially the people of Hana-eup…
- There's always a way.

645
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:17,769
I even contributed to the
festival development fund

646
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,769
and agreed to sponsor the after-party.

647
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,502
Besides,

648
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:25,902
I decided to receive a little help
from Ms. Kang Hee's friends.

649
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:27,002
What friends?

650
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:28,369
You know, friends.

651
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:30,236
So who is it?

652
00:43:30,236 --> 00:43:32,269
Gangsters?

653
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:37,369
You said you'd help first,
even though I didn't ask for it.

654
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,569
Gosh. They're suddenly changing
the traffic control section?

655
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,736
This is going to be an enormous amount of work.

656
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:45,602
Hey, but I'm…

657
00:43:45,602 --> 00:43:50,536
I'm proud to have a friend who cooperates,
a true support for the people.

658
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:51,702
Are you being sarcastic?

659
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:53,469
I won't do it. I won't!

660
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:56,269
No, our people's support…

661
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,802
Is also handsome.

662
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,536
And cool.

663
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,502
Where should I start?

664
00:44:01,502 --> 00:44:04,469
<i>[Traffic Control Information]</i>

665
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:09,369
<i>[Traffic Control Section Change Notice]</i>

666
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:10,969
Quickly! Quickly!

667
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:13,269
<i>[Announcement]</i>

668
00:44:23,436 --> 00:44:27,669
<i>[Traffic Control Section Change Notice]</i>

669
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,602
There, spray on that side too.

670
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,902
Push it a bit more this way.

671
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:38,202
No, that way.

672
00:44:38,202 --> 00:44:39,869
Are you upset?

673
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:42,236
Yes.

674
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:45,602
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang Hee.

675
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:49,969
No, it's not at you. I am angry at myself.

676
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:54,602
They're my friends.

677
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:59,602
They're the friends who truly wish
for my success more than anyone.

678
00:44:59,602 --> 00:45:03,936
Friends who would help gladly whenever asked.

679
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:10,236
All I need to do is receive help
and thank them.

680
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:14,036
But I couldn't do even that.

681
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:17,436
Because my feelings were twisted.

682
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:23,069
If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be able
to start, and I would be a total loser.

683
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,402
Thank you, Manager Geum.

684
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,002
Are you serious?

685
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:33,736
Of course, it's genuine.

686
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:37,802
Then let's go to the after-party together,
to eat beef, at the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

687
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,236
Sure.

688
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,569
I don't do this for just anyone.

689
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:45,436
Alright, here we go.

690
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:51,136
Thank you! Thank you!

691
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:53,269
Thanks to you, the construction
went well today. Thank you.

692
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:56,036
Oh my, don't just settle for this.

693
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:57,936
Show me the cash envelope.

694
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:00,269
Goodness, you!

695
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:01,802
Should I take care of it myself as expected?

696
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:05,902
Goodness! He gave ten million won
for the festival fund. Stop pushing!

697
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:08,369
But the people of our village…

698
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:13,369
Would it be too much to have a tour
for the festival in the next town?

699
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:14,702
Ah, that…

700
00:46:14,702 --> 00:46:16,569
I'll discuss it with Ms. Kang Hee.

701
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:17,602
Enjoy your meal.

702
00:46:17,602 --> 00:46:20,169
Wait! I just need a definite answer.

703
00:46:20,169 --> 00:46:23,469
Hey, Kang Hee! Ji Kang Hee!

704
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:28,702
Go on. Go, quickly.

705
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,002
- Hello.
- Have you been well?

706
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:31,736
Hello.

707
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:34,736
Oh, Yeon Soo. Come here.

708
00:46:34,736 --> 00:46:36,436
Welcome, veterinarian couple.

709
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:37,969
- Hello.
- Oh, our Su Ji.

710
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:40,569
You don't know how much we adore Ms. Yoon.

711
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:45,236
Aww! She's pretty, kind and diligent.

712
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,302
Gosh! You're lovely!

713
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:48,869
It's because you treat me so well.

714
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:50,636
She also speaks so nicely.

715
00:46:50,636 --> 00:46:52,736
It's a match made in heaven!

716
00:46:52,736 --> 00:46:55,969
Manager Geum, our Yeon Soo is lucky, right?

717
00:46:55,969 --> 00:46:59,736
Ah, yes, the two are a good match.

718
00:47:00,802 --> 00:47:02,636
Cheon Yeon Soo.

719
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:05,202
Congratulations.

720
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:08,769
Congratulations, ma'am.

721
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:12,369
Oh, right, thank you.

722
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:15,302
Congratulations to you, too.

723
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:19,169
I wondered what kind of person you'd become.
But you've succeeded, right?

724
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,736
You've got good skills too.

725
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:25,569
Absolutely no returns on this one.

726
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:27,936
No, no. Well, we…

727
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:29,236
We'll leave.

728
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:31,202
Alright, goodbye.

729
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:44,136
Ms. Kang Hee.

730
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:46,369
It seems that people might have
some misunderstandings.

731
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:48,169
I'm sorry.

732
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:52,936
Just until the construction is over,
I'll use you just one more time.

733
00:47:57,036 --> 00:47:58,802
I don't want to.

734
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:01,102
This time, I have conditions too.

735
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:06,769
Seung Eon, today is the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

736
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:10,902
Do you want to go together…
not together, though?

737
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:13,136
Hey, Cha Seung Eon.

738
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:17,036
You've got nothing to do today, right? Do you…

739
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:21,636
No, why does this keep…
No, let's think this over.

740
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:23,502
Ah Reum!

741
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:28,836
Wait a minute, I'll go.

742
00:48:28,836 --> 00:48:31,102
Stay there.

743
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:44,869
Are you off work?

744
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:46,036
Yeah.

745
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:48,669
Were you on your way somewhere?

746
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:50,936
- Yeah.
- Where?

747
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:53,936
I don't know.

748
00:48:53,936 --> 00:48:56,036
Do you have a moment?

749
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:58,402
Yeah, why?

750
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,136
Han… Hanwoo…

751
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:05,569
It's the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

752
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:09,302
Do you want to go together?

753
00:49:10,936 --> 00:49:12,036
Just the two of us?

754
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:14,302
If we go, all the kids will probably be there.

755
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:20,736
Yeah, let's go.

756
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:23,102
Let's go.

757
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:34,869
Boss.

758
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:39,136
Boss?

759
00:49:45,002 --> 00:49:46,002
Yes?

760
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:48,069
It's time for you to go.

761
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,036
Kang Hee,

762
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:14,236
can we talk for a minute?

763
00:50:14,236 --> 00:50:15,936
I'm all done though.

764
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:17,869
I have nothing to say.

765
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:22,669
Then, just listen. Actually, Ms. Yoon and I…

766
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:25,502
Impressive, isn't it?

767
00:50:26,102 --> 00:50:29,102
You too, me too.

768
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:33,736
We received congratulations from people.

769
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:38,336
The adults in Hana-eup
knew how to give blessings too.

770
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:40,369
I'm at a loss of words.

771
00:50:42,502 --> 00:50:44,969
Even to people like us.

772
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:49,302
They pretend to worry, pretend to do favors.

773
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:52,002
While they were harsh and cruel before.

774
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:54,736
Why do you remember such things?

775
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:57,702
Just erase it.

776
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:01,069
Forget it and live.

777
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:03,836
- But that's not what's important…
- Exactly.

778
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:07,569
I should have.

779
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:11,336
But I'm trying to do so now.

780
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:17,069
Because there's no need
to hear such things anymore.

781
00:51:22,402 --> 00:51:24,102
Ms. Kang Hee!

782
00:51:26,436 --> 00:51:28,702
Did you drink?

783
00:51:28,702 --> 00:51:30,336
Ah, yes.

784
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:32,202
His mother kept offering it to me.

785
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:34,736
I ran away under the excuse of looking for him.

786
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:38,636
Director, please go find
your mother. I will be with unnie…

787
00:51:38,636 --> 00:51:41,602
I can call you "unnie", right?
[*unnie means older sister]

788
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:45,102
On the day of Chil Ddaeng surgery,

789
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:51,002
if it weren't for you, it would have
been really tough for me.

790
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:53,169
Thank you, unnie.

791
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,169
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

792
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:58,969
Ah, next time…

793
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:00,936
I have company.

794
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,969
Really?

795
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:06,169
Then, next time, for sure!

796
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:10,136
You got it? Right?

797
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:11,802
Right?

798
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:16,269
Ms. Yoon, please stop it.

799
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:22,236
Next time, for sure!

800
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:34,636
<i>She's pretty,</i>

801
00:52:34,636 --> 00:52:37,736
<i>kind and diligent.</i>

802
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:40,369
<i>It's because you treat me so well.</i>

803
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,102
<i>She also speaks so nicely.</i>

804
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:44,902
<i>It's a match made in heaven!</i>

805
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:48,669
It must be nice, Cheon Yeon Soo.

806
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:02,602
<i>Well…</i>

807
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:04,436
<i>The thing about us working together,</i>

808
00:53:04,436 --> 00:53:07,969
<i>I think we might have to put it on hold.</i>

809
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:11,669
<i>Why? Because the rumor
has spread all over town?</i>

810
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:14,869
<i>I don't want to.</i>

811
00:53:15,536 --> 00:53:19,802
<i>Thanks to that, I don't get nagged at home,
nor am I told to go for dates.</i>

812
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:21,669
<i>I am saying I like things the way they are now.</i>

813
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:24,302
<i>Can't we just date for the time being?</i>

814
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:26,369
<i>That won't work.</i>

815
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,069
<i>Why not?</i>

816
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:31,236
<i>I have someone I like.</i>

817
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:34,636
<i>Right now, I'm waiting for that person.</i>

818
00:53:34,636 --> 00:53:37,102
<i>Exactly.</i>

819
00:53:37,102 --> 00:53:40,936
<i>If you also have someone you like,
you don't need to do on dates unwillingly.</i>

820
00:53:40,936 --> 00:53:44,802
<i>Let's just date until that person
comes, just for the time being.</i>

821
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:47,202
<i>After all, the rumor has already spread.</i>

822
00:53:47,202 --> 00:53:50,902
<i>What's the difference
between clarifying it now or later?</i>

823
00:53:50,902 --> 00:53:54,102
<i>What will you do if the rumor
becomes too much to handle?</i>

824
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:55,902
<i>Then,</i>

825
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:57,936
<i>let's just go out, whatever.</i>

826
00:53:57,936 --> 00:53:58,969
<i>What?</i>

827
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,436
<i>Ah, I'm just kidding.</i>

828
00:54:03,269 --> 00:54:07,002
<i>I really want to see who is
the person you like so much.</i>

829
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:09,969
<i>Just to see her face once.</i>

830
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:16,736
<i>[Mom]</i>

831
00:54:17,902 --> 00:54:21,136
<i>[Mom]</i>

832
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:24,702
He must be somewhere around here.

833
00:54:24,702 --> 00:54:27,502
- Ah, he's not answering.
- Hey!

834
00:54:27,502 --> 00:54:29,736
Your husband is over there.

835
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:42,669
Hey! Hey!

836
00:54:46,602 --> 00:54:48,102
What are you doing?

837
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:50,702
Oh, what's wrong?

838
00:54:50,702 --> 00:54:53,336
Trying to seduce my husband?

839
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:56,402
Me? What are you talking about?

840
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:58,669
These people, really…

841
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:13,602
Hey, get up!

842
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,702
Hey, what have I done for you to…

843
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:26,236
Dae Sik!

844
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,069
Dae Sik!

845
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:33,569
What did you say? In front of her?

846
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:36,302
The whole neighborhood is watching.

847
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:38,136
Hey, Dae Sik!

848
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,102
Hey, calm down.

849
00:55:50,536 --> 00:55:52,869
You know me, right? Dae Sik!

850
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:55,136
Have a drink with me.

851
00:55:55,136 --> 00:55:57,069
It's okay. It's okay.

852
00:55:57,069 --> 00:55:58,502
<i>Mom, what's going on?</i>

853
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:02,069
<i>Kang Hee, please call Dad.</i>

854
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:03,136
<i>Please call Dad.</i>

855
00:56:03,136 --> 00:56:04,669
I understand. I know.

856
00:56:04,669 --> 00:56:07,202
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Have a drink with me.

857
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:19,236
I just took one love shot.

858
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:21,036
Sir, what's wrong? What's the matter?

859
00:56:21,036 --> 00:56:22,702
- What is it?
- Min Goo, no, it's not…

860
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:26,102
Min Goo, I'll take care of everything.

861
00:56:26,102 --> 00:56:27,702
Alright.

862
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,569
We will handle the cleanup,
so please go about your business.

863
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:31,302
Oh, what a lovely day.

864
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:32,802
Just keep doing what you were doing.

865
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:34,736
Everything is okay.

866
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:39,402
Look, the hero arrives.

867
00:56:40,636 --> 00:56:43,869
Well… what should I have done, then?

868
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:50,336
Whenever Ms. Su Ji
is mentioned, both then and now,

869
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:53,069
you just…

870
00:56:53,069 --> 00:56:55,369
Isn't it pitiful?

871
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:57,802
Then what about me?

872
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:02,169
What about Mom?

873
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:08,402
What about my brother who died?

874
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:24,902
Ah, it's annoying.

875
00:57:33,836 --> 00:57:37,402
I've gotten too old to loathe freely.

876
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:41,169
My hair has completely turned white

877
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:43,402
and I have many wrinkles.

878
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:48,469
No, what would you do if you get hurt?
Why on earth are you doing this?

879
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:51,236
I really can't get it.

880
00:57:58,702 --> 00:58:00,136
Just for you.

881
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:01,936
Who?

882
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:36,402
Who was it?

883
00:58:36,402 --> 00:58:38,536
Who said to give it to me?

884
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:40,969
Who else could it be?

885
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:50,202
Cheon Yeon Soo!

886
00:58:57,402 --> 00:58:59,102
Kkam Hee.

887
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,436
What? Were you alone?

888
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:10,502
No, it's someone else's room.

889
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:12,602
Why are you crying?

890
00:59:14,536 --> 00:59:16,536
You have no food?

891
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:08,602
Teddy bear.

892
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:15,736
<i>I have just one favor to ask.</i>

893
01:00:18,802 --> 01:00:23,636
<i>Sell the teddy bear and take care
of Charlie after she gives birth.</i>

894
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:27,802
<i>And if there's money left,
please feed the kittens too.</i>

895
01:00:33,136 --> 01:00:35,636
Cheon Yeon Soo, you clueless teddy bear.

896
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,336
Why do you keep doing this to me?

897
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:25,936
Cheon Yeon Soo!

898
01:02:25,936 --> 01:02:28,169
Why did you help me?

899
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:33,202
Answer me!

900
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:40,269
Do you like me?

901
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:54,602
That's all I can do,
because that's all there is.

902
01:02:55,736 --> 01:02:58,802
I can't even wipe away your tears.

903
01:02:59,602 --> 01:03:03,302
As someone who's rejected by his
first love, I can't hold you back either.

904
01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:08,402
That's all I can do for you one last time,
because that's all there is.

905
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:12,602
I can't even do that?

906
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:16,502
You hate it?

907
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:21,069
One last time?

908
01:03:21,069 --> 01:03:23,802
Who says it's the last time?

909
01:03:23,802 --> 01:03:25,702
Who said you could change
the ending as you please?

910
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:29,969
I know, the beginning
and the end are always up to you.

911
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:34,269
But I need some time.

912
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,269
Time? What time?

913
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:40,136
Time to forget you.

914
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:47,002
So, don't worry.

915
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:50,069
Don't feel burdened, and don't get angry.

916
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:56,669
Just give me some time.

917
