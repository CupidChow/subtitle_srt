1
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:29,110


2
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,192
 She's a mutt! She's a mutt! 

3
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:39,892
 She's a mutt! She's a mutt! 

4
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:43,359
 She's a mutt! She's a mutt! 

5
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,759
 She's a mutt! She's a mutt! 

6
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,059
 She's a mutt! She's a mutt! 

7
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,925
Welcome.

8
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,792
Cold, huh?

9
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:18,359
Thank you.

10
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,225
Your hands must be cold.

11
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,025
It's okay.

12
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:31,159
So, have you had a chance to talk about it?

13
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,892
She treats me like I'm invisible.

14
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:37,325
According to Ah Reum, she's already signed the contract for the goshitel*. 
  (a type of budget-friendly, off-campus accommodation that's also known as a goshiwon, one-room-tel, or residence) 

15
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,792
Are you okay with that?

16
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,525
 No, I am not okay. 

17
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,925
You know, when Kang Hee goes to Seoul,

18
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:52,892
she will meet a lot of Seoul guys.

19
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,659
So what?

20
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,359
Are you okay with that?

21
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:05,259
Yeah, well, given the situation…

22
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,692
When I was young,

23
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:15,225
I was quite the troublemaker for my mom.

24
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:18,725
At the end of the day, she's my daughter after all.

25
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,459
Right?

26
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,359
This.

27
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,992
Give this to Kang Hee.

28
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,792
What is this?

29
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,059
Just give it to Kang Hee.

30
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,159
You should give it to her yourself.

31
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,459
How can I give it to someone who won't even look me in the eye?

32
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,392
It's because I'm shy.

33
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:44,692
You might be shy, sir,

34
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,959
but I'm scared to.

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,625
She's your friend.

36
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,459
You're her dad.

37
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,792
Please give it to her yourself.

38
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,025
You've got a call.

39
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,859
You should answer it.

40
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,359
Answer it and come out.

41
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,892
Yes.

42
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,159
Hello?

43
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,525
Where are you? Everyone is already waiting.

44
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,759
 Huh? I'll be right there. 

45
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,136
I can't stand to watch them being insolent anymore.

46
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,925
- Come quickly! 
  - Okay. 

47
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,359
- I'll toss what I'm eating. 
 - Okay.

48
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,559
Shoot! Shoot!

49
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,959
Yeon Soo, happy New Year.

50
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,592
Happy New Year, sir.

51
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:29,825
Sure.

52
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:32,692
I hope to receive lots of blessings in the New Year.

53
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:37,059
Seems like your friends are waiting. Go ahead.

54
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,425
Aren't you going to the motel?

55
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,859
I have someone to meet.

56
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,792
Take care.

57
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,192
I said I'm going.

58
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,725
 You're coming? 

59
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,859
 Okay, come on. 

60
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,059
I was supposed to meet Han Woo.

61
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,859
 Then... I'll say my goodbyes now. 

62
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:06,825
Live well, Cheon Yeon Soo.

63
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:11,459
Today, I'll take the last train to go to Seoul

64
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,859
and welcome the New Year in Jonggak.

65
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:15,359
And...

66
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,092
I won't come here ever again.

67
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:22,759
Kang Hee, wait.

68
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,859
I'll be there soon, so wait for me. Okay?

69
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:38,359
   

70
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,559
   

71
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,692
Kang Hee.

72
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:38,892
Kang Hee.

73
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,959
Ji Kang Hee!

74
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,759
 Teddy bear. 

75
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,925
That's too bright, stop it.

76
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:57,459
Why is it so dark?

77
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,759
- The electricity is cut off. 
 - A blackout?

78
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,325
No, it was cut off, because we couldn't pay the bill.

79
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,025
How did that happen?

80
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,192
Chun Pil must have spent it all on some gold mine or silver mine in Australia.

81
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,859
He spent all the money, I guess.

82
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,159
What about the manager?

83
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:22,592
Mr. Kwon went to Jeju Island because he had things to take care of.

84
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,592
He said he'll be back in a few days.

85
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,692
Chun Pil also said he wouldn't be able to come in today because he's meeting someone.

86
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,392
So, you've been alone until now?

87
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,792
When have I not been alone?

88
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,825
Charlie, hello!

89
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,025
Look at this.

90
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,959
What is this?

91
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,525
It's a birthday gift from Chun Pil.

92
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,192
A teddy bear.

93
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,059
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

94
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,092
He said this is an original.

95
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:29,792
Someone brought it by plane from Germany on a business trip, upon request.

96
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,159
Still, he put a lot of thought into it.

97
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,425
What's wrong with him?

98
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,259
I think he's lost it.

99
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,970
The motel is about to be auctioned off.

100
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,950
Why gift me a dollar that costs over one million won when he can't even pay the electricity bill?

101
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,392
He is crazy! Crazy.

102
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,559
But you still like teddy bears, don't you?

103
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,592
That was when I was a kid.

104
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,525
I'm turning 20 tomorrow. What am I supposed to do with this?

105
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:52,125
A laptop would be another story.

106
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,659
So annoying.

107
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,259
The more I look at it, the angrier I get, the more it annoys me.

108
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,092
It's super cozy.

109
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,559
Teddy bear.

110
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:14,225
Looks like you.

111
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:31,680
-Teddy bear, answer me, because this is the last time I'm asking. 
 - What?

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,192
Are you really not going to college in Seoul?

113
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,792
Sorry.

114
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,125
No need to be sorry.

115
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,925
To you, Grandfather must be a bigger priority than me.

116
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,492
You brat without any ambition.

117
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:49,892
It's not like that, but it's true I have no ambition.

118
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,259
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,492
Come here.

120
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,092
This teddy bear brat.

121
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:08,059
You've gained more weight, haven't you?

122
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,059
No, what are you talking about?

123
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,525
What do you mean, no?

124
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:14,159
Let's see. Look at this fat.

125
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,492
- You weigh over 100kg, don't you? 
 - Over 100kg, my foot.

126
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,225
Ah, it's ticklish, stop it. I said stop it.

127
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:29,325
Yeon Soo, will you sleep with me?

128
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,692
You must be crazy!

129
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,625
Geez, really.

130
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,659
What? Why are you so surprised?

131
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:44,759
You think of me every day, don't you?

132
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,825
Why are you suddenly saying weird things?

133
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:49,559
What's weird? It's natural.

134
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,625
It's you and me.

135
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,425
Stop talking nonsense.

136
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,292
You...

137
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,559
dream of me every night, don't you?

138
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,725
It's not just thinking, is it?

139
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,759
What are you saying?

140
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,359
I can't hear you.

141
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:12,525
I know all about the condoms you have inside your wallet.

142
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:16,192
Hey, that's because you gave them to me saying they were motel freebies.

143
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,225
The same with Han Woo, Seung Eon, and me, right?

144
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:21,259
You gave them to us to share equally…

145
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:25,459
You gave them to us to use.

146
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,759
Have you already used them all up?

147
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,592
I thought I gave two to only you...

148
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:32,125
That's not true.

149
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,192
You gave two each to Han Woo, Seung Eon, and me!

150
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,525
Acting like you don't even know.

151
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:41,592
So you're saying you still have both inside your wallet?

152
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,625
Let's use them today.

153
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,859
Let me see.

154
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,092
Where is it?

155
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,525
Where is it? Let me see.

156
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,392
No, it's not there. I'm telling you, it's not.

157
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:56,625
- Oh? I think I found it. 
 - No, that's a phone.

158
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,459
Give it here.

159
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,692
I told you it's not it.

160
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,892
- But it is. 
 - Why are you like this, really?

161
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,559
I'm going to leave.

162
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:13,325
After I leave,

163
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,692
you'll meet another girl,

164
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:22,492
fall in love, and have sex.

165
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,659
Isn't that what you'll do?

166
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,025
I want to be your first.

167
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:44,159
Why?

168
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,425
Aren't you a first-timer?

169
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:48,025
 It's my first time. 

170
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,459
 If… If you want to. 

171
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:54,192
I don't want to join your rebellion.

172
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,425
It's neither curiosity nor a rebellious spirit.

173
00:12:57,425 --> 00:12:59,292
It's just that...

174
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:04,225
the first time is the purest.

175
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,092
You don't like that?

176
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,292
Should we stop?

177
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,359
If we do it,

178
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,992
will you stay?

179
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,259
I am going to leave.

180
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:49,692
 I'll go where they don't know I'm different. 

181
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,792
 How are you different? 

182
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,859
 My hair color. 

183
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,759
 My eye color. 

184
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,125
 Freckles. 

185
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,225
 To me, you're just beautiful. 

186
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,759
Yeon Soo.

187
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,259
Will you sleep with me?

188
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,359
Don't lose weight.

189
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:39,092
Don't take off your glasses in front of others.

190
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:55,325
Don't smile with your eyes either.

191
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:22,025
   

192
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:31,092
Don't wear your glasses yet.

193
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:53,525
Why are you putting on so many layers?

194
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:56,159
I have to minimize my luggage.

195
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,459
Ah, right!

196
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:11,259
This.

197
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,092
What is it?

198
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:21,192
Your father asked me to give you this.

199
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,992
 Anyway, daughter, make sure to use birth control. 

200
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,725
What's wrong?

201
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:50,192
Hey, I must be a dutiful daughter.

202
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:53,325
Look at this. Chun Pil wrote this.

203
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:57,392
"Anyway, daughter, make sure to use birth control"

204
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:03,650
It's again confirmed that I was a mistake to him.

205
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,950
As if I needed reminding.

206
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,059
Here.

207
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:32,892
I'll take you to the station.

208
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,925
I have a favor to ask.

209
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:43,292
Sell the teddy bear and take care of Charlie after she gives birth.

210
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:48,559
And if there's money left, please feed the kittens, too.

211
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,559
I'm leaving.

212
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:08,859
The name?

213
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,759
Huh?

214
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,725
The kittens.

215
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,725
You should give them names before you go.

216
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,000
♫  I realized it as I stared quietly into your eyes  ♫

217
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,600
♫  My love for you, fearlessly, keeps growing   ♫

218
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,300
♫  My confession that never reached you, I love you  ♫

219
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:59,700
♫  Will a part of my sincerity reach you today?  ♫

220
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:07,400
♫  My clumsy confession to you  ♫

221
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,670
♫  has grown even larger since yesterday  ♫

222
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:26,200
♫  My shy, hesitant first words to you  ♫

223
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,200
♫  Those seemingly meaningless words contained my feelings for you  ♫

224
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:41,200
♫  I may not have said "I love you"  ♫

225
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:49,350
♫  But it was all love  ♫

226
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, Yeon Soo, what am I supposed to do?

227
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,900
Mr. Park and Mr. Kim both can't make it.

228
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,500
The mother cow is bawling as if she's dying. I feel like I'm dying, too.

229
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,900
You said the amniotic fluid broke. There's no time, so let's go quickly.

230
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's hurry. Oh, dear.

231
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,259
Oh no! Are you okay? And the calf, too?

232
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,500
I'll tie and pull it. Please help me when I do.

233
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,600
Well, I have to.

234
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,790
Oh, it's okay.

235
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,592
Hang in there a little longer. It seems like it's almost out.

236
00:23:58,892 --> 00:24:02,659
It's out! It's out!

237
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,100
You did well.

238
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,492
Grow up healthy.

239
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,125
Go away, that's enough now.

240
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:17,780
The weather is getting colder.

241
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,050
It would be good to start dressing the calves in warm clothes

242
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,600
and clean the barn a bit, too.

243
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Well, I might as well do it.

244
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll help out for a day.

245
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,100
You will?

246
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,300
Then, how about this? In return, I could look for a good match for you?

247
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,400
That's okay. I have someone I'm going to marry.

248
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
Ah, you're lying again.

249
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,300
No, really.

250
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,600
That's why I go to Seoul every weekend.

251
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,100
A girl from Seoul?

252
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,492
What does she do?

253
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Now, there are many matters to intervene in today's processes.

254
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,700
The electrical, steel, mechanical, metal, and carpentry teams.

255
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,425
I hope everyone can compromise a little and proceed with the work.

256
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,300
I see many new faces here today.

257
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,600
Please do not start working on your own under any circumstances.

258
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,225
You must always ask before you begin your task.

259
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,700
Now, above all, safety is the most important thing.

260
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
Be sure to wear your equipment.

261
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,300
And never run or throw materials during work.

262
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,500
Now, for safety, let's chant "safety" three times and then start the work.

263
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,700
One, two, three.

264
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,459
Safety, safety, safety!

265
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:30,625
Excuse me!

266
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,525
Who is it?

267
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:37,859
Oh, I'm supposed to meet the site manager here.

268
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,240
Stay right there.

269
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,192
You could get hurt barging in here like that.

270
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,725
Yes.

271
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:48,592
Yes, Manager, where are you?

272
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:50,725
There's someone here to see you.

273
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,659
Don't worry too much about safety, that's what I'm saying.

274
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,292
Yes.

275
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,200
Look at that, there.

276
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Hey, Ji Kang Hee, slipping away?

277
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,090
Why is this still here?

278
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,450
Haven't you moved it to the second floor?

279
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,700
This is why women are a problem.

280
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,800
Who cares if she knows things or has a degree?

281
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Look at this. This!

282
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,100
You're as skinny as a stick.

283
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,200
How would you do anything with this weak arm?

284
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,290
Right?

285
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:45,092
Hey, what are you doing?

286
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,400
Let go, will you?

287
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,125
I'm strong, you know?

288
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,059
Ah, go away.

289
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:56,692
Hey! You!

290
00:26:56,692 --> 00:26:58,359
Get out!

291
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:01,492
I was going to quit anyway.

292
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:04,559
I said I would quit if you messed with me one more time.

293
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,859
Hey! Ji Kang Hee!

294
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:09,092
Don't you dare show up at my site again!

295
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,800
How rude, that disrespectful!

296
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,325
Oh my, that…

297
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,492
Excuse me.

298
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,125
I have something to ask.

299
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,559
It's your first time at the site, right?

300
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,659
Oh, yes.

301
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,600
If you wear wide pants like this at the site,

302
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,700
you can easily trip and fall.

303
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,259
- Oh, I see. 
 - Put these ankle straps on.

304
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,560
And wear a neck warmer if possible.

305
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,400
It gets pretty dusty.

306
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Have you filled out the contract?

307
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,900
No, not yet.

308
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,200
- When you write the contract, you must make sure to check the daily payment date. 
 - Yes.

309
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,300
As for the site, because the scaffolding is made of old recycled materials,

310
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,700
- be extra careful when moving around. 
 - Yes.

311
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,700
You don't have to worry about the foreman nagging to collect scrap metal,

312
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,659
since he's just going to sell it and pocket the money anyway.

313
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:27,525
I heard you used to be an interior designer.

314
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,692
I heard it from the site manager.

315
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:32,759
I'll introduce myself properly.

316
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,692
My name is Hwang Jeong Goo, and I'm the new site supervisor.

317
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,892
   

318
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,825
How about starting over as a designer?

319
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,300
Thanks for the offer, but I'm fine.

320
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,800
Why? Because of the blacklist?

321
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
Your pay was six months behind.

322
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Isn't it natural to report unpaid wages in such a situation?

323
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,500
Know this, blacklisting and whatnot, it's a wrong practice to give disadvantages.

324
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,000
Instead of working for dirty people like that, come to Moment and…

325
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,600
Is Moment any different?

326
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
Do you think I haven't tried?

327
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,292
They say no educational restrictions, but won't accept a resume from a lower university.

328
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:18,725
Please don't give me false hope.

329
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:27,859
Then, instead of Moment, trust me, Hwang Jeong Goo, and come.

330
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,459
I'll support and fight for you if anyone mistreats you this time.

331
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:38,092
When can you prepare your portfolio?

332
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,200
I've come to see the director.

333
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,000
What's your name?

334
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,459
It's Ji Kang Hee.

335
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:07,525
- Just leave it here. 
 - Excuse me?

336
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:10,525
The director is not here right now, so just leave it.

337
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,325
I'll wait.

338
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:14,225
Well, then... suit yourself.

339
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,000
Unbelievable! She really came.

340
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,250
You know, the girl I talked about last time.

341
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,900
Director Hwang must be crazy.

342
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,500
She should know better after being sent to a construction site instead of being appointed CEO.

343
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,800
That's what I'm saying. She doesn't know how long she'll last.

344
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,200
How could she bring in a nobody that was part of a construction crew?

345
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Obviously, the design team wouldn't take her.

346
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Even I got demoted for being part of Director Hwang's team.

347
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,100
Would you take her? Someone who was doing manual labor…

348
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,792
Excuse me.

349
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:56,592
Ah, just a moment.

350
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:58,792
Which school did you graduate from?

351
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,859
Want to grab a coffee later?

352
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,425
Okay.

353
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,690
♫  Close your eyes and feel me here  ♫

354
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:41,480
What? Why are you staring?

355
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,225
♫  What color is in your mind?  ♫

356
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:47,490
I know, that I'm not cool.

357
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:53,225
♫  Blue, dark gray, calm and sweet  ♫

358
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:55,200
I'm going back.

359
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,300
I'm going to go back. I'm Ji Kang Hee!

360
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:06,000
♫  Please tell me if you're standing here for me  ♫

361
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,400
♫   Far across the dream, just call my name  ♫

362
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,900
♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

363
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,200
♫  Here I am  ♫

364
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,100
 Kang Hee, shall we have some ice cream? 

365
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,159
 No. 

366
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,300
 I heard a Berry Scoop opened in Central City. 

367
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,500
 There are so many unique flavors. 

368
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,925
 I'll buy it for you, okay? 

369
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,490
 Look, this is a butterfly. 

370
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,450
 It only goes to pretty flowers. 

371
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:40,425
 Huh? It's going towards you. 

372
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:44,959
 Do you want to try it? 

373
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,425
 Oh! It's here. We need to get on this one. 

374
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,525
 Hello. For two, please. 

375
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,892
 How did you know? 

376
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,425
 Know what? 

377
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:07,492
 How did you know the police came to the motel? 

378
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,292
 I didn't know. 

379
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,825
 Well. 

380
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:18,959
 Affairs one moment and love triangle fights the next. 

381
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,459
 Just when things calm down, a wanted fugitive shows up. 

382
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,125
 There's always an investigation going on. 

383
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,900
 But seriously, how did you know? 

384
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,059
 How do you always know when to ask me to get ice cream with you? 

385
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,600
 I just know. I'm always looking at you. 

386
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,092
 Don't look at me. 

387
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,100
 Don't look at me, look forward. 

388
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,400
 I said don't look, don't move. 

389
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,000
 Just try to move. I'll kill you. 

390
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,800
♫  Please tell me, are you standing here, for us?  ♫

391
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:06,100
♫  Far across the dream, just call my name?  ♫

392
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,700
    
 ♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

393
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:17,000
♫  Here I am  ♫

394
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,080
♫  Where I am  ♫

395
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,500
No wonder you got kicked off the design team.

396
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,400
Director Hwang is a legend in this field of work, isn't she?

397
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,500
When someone like her brings in a nobody from a construction site,

398
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,900
shouldn't you be curious about their portfolio?

399
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,800
- If you consider yourself a designer,  at the very least. 
 -  What do you think you're doing?

400
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,100
Aren't you curious?

401
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,200
About what kind of designer I am, how skilled I am?

402
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,500
I'll show you. Who I am and what kind of designer I am.

403
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,400
- Sure, but not right no— 
 - You're not Director Hwang.

404
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Let me speak with her directly.

405
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,059
- Director went out… 
 - Move.

406
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,092
You're here.

407
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,300
Sorry, I couldn't hear anything from the outside.

408
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,580
Your eye makeup looks great.

409
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,400
The smoky shadow suits you so well.

410
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,000
Do you always do it that way?

411
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,659
Sometimes, only when necessary.

412
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,625
It's like combat gear to me.

413
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,200
I really like that attitude.

414
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,900
Then what about weapons?

415
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,100
Pardon?

416
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,500
Weapons.

417
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,125
Pardon?

418
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:48,325
Your portfolio.

419
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,092
Ah, yes.

420
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,659
Shall we take a look?

421
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,100
- Did you really do this yourself? 
 - Yes.

422
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,400
That doesn't make sense.

423
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,200
There'd be more than enough part-time jobs available

424
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,740
if you're this good with CAD and SketchUp.

425
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,200
I'm sure they'd pay better as well.

426
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,700
It was the site of a blueprint I worked on.

427
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,000
I wanted to see how a blueprint is turned into reality.

428
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,600
You're a step too late. Here's the CEO's pick.

429
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,100
Graduated from Parsons in New York and completed an internship with the Rockwell Group.

430
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,292
Not comparable to someone who graduated from a random college and worked at a construction site.

431
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:06,092
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

432
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,500
The Grand Village in Hannam-dong.

433
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,100
A 400-square-meter villa with a garden.

434
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,000
It needs remodeling. What do you think?

435
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,500
- It's a personal request I received, so there are no bidding nor budget limits. 
 - So what?

436
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,100
I think you should do it, Mr. Mok.

437
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,600
And Ms. Ji Kang Hee could learn a lot, too.

438
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,500
But I'd need your approval, right?

439
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,700
No, no.

440
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,500
- It's your project, why should I? 
 - Then the credit would go to...

441
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,900
You, of course.

442
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,200
Just take Ms. Ji Kang Hee as the project designer.

443
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,500
Let's start you out as an intern.

444
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,200
We'll consider formal employment after working on the project together.

445
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,100
And decide after three months.

446
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,725
Deal.

447
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:01,925
Um…

448
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,200
Do you like me?

449
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,400
Pardon?

450
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,600
Why go to such lengths, for someone you just met?

451
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,100
Isn't this the second time? And we'll keep seeing each other going forward.

452
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,900
You were the first to be kind to me when we met.

453
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,100
I did that because I thought you were someone who came to work.

454
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Thanks to what you told me, I came to know

455
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,600
about reinforcing bars being diverted, materials being fudged, and payments being delayed.

456
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,800
I was able to grasp the situation at once

457
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,292
and completely took control of the manager and his men.

458
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:33,559
So I'm just repaying my debt.

459
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,125
Thank you for the opportunity.

460
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,025
Let's make one more thing clear.

461
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,459
I really like men.

462
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,559
Hey, don't you ever get tired? Coming to Seoul every time you have a day off?

463
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,200
It's Seoul.

464
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,600
Seoul, what about it?

465
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,300
You know best what Seoul means to me.

466
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,100
You really think you can coincidentally run into her?

467
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,800
Wake up! Seoul's population is ten million. Ten million!

468
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,900
Still, the possibility isn't zero.

469
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,500
Then, on the off chance, you actually run into Ji Kang Hee.

470
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,300
What would you do?

471
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,359
If we meet?

472
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:19,825
Will I be able to recognize her?

473
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:23,259
Ji Kang Hee.

474
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
 Today is the client meeting. 

475
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,100
 As I mentioned yesterday, please make sure you use your best discretion 

476
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,700
 and select the best five drafts. 

477
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,300
 - Yes. 
 - Yes, I understand. 

478
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,400
- So Min. 
 - Yes?

479
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,700
How much should we estimate for each draft?

480
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,059
We are budgeting about 8,000 to 9,000 for each draft…

481
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,600
8,000 to 9,000…

482
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,900
Ms. Ji Kang Hee,

483
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,700
an intern's job is to do as they're told and answer the phone. Go on.

484
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,400
How long have you been sitting there?

485
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
- That's what I'm saying... 
 - Um…

486
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,400
Please increase the price per square meter a bit more.

487
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,225
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

488
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:12,500
Why would an intern need business cards?

489
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,100
Having a business card is the least you can prepare when meeting clients.

490
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,400
You want me to take the intern?

491
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,600
Of course, it's her responsibility.

492
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,800
I've already let the clients know.

493
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,892
Have a good meeting.

494
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:35,159
Our intern is quite capable, isn't she?

495
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,125
That's right.

496
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,459
Thank you as always, Han Woo.

497
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,292
What are you thanking me for again?

498
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:47,092
Are there no difficult customers these days?

499
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:48,930
Oh, why wouldn't there be?

500
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,420
Don't even mention it… There was a big fuss yesterday.

501
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,859
Oh, dear.

502
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:56,259
I can't handle it anymore, either.

503
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,400
- Would you like something to drink? It's on me. 
 - Really?

504
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,200
In that case, why don't we recharge with some caffeine.

505
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,000
I was just feeling like I needed that.

506
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,125
Sounds good.

507
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:13,092
No, no, it has to be the most expensive one…

508
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:16,359
No need for alternatives, second-best, cost-effectiveness, or anything of the sort.

509
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,825
Just give me the best of whatever.

510
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:22,859
Understood, I'll do my best.

511
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,759
Pack up, it's time to go.

512
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:30,192
Already? We haven't had our meeting yet.

513
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,925
We just had the meeting.

514
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,000
We need to meet the newlyweds who will actually live here, not just the person paying,

515
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,900
to learn what kind of house they want.

516
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,800
- What kind of interior do they want… 
 - It's our job to suggest that.

517
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,600
Start by preparing the concept board.

518
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,592
We can't force people into a home; we need to make the proper house for them.

519
00:42:51,592 --> 00:42:54,892
I'm sorry, she is still an intern…

520
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:58,759
Ms. Ji Kang Hee?

521
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,059
Yes.

522
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:03,725
That's a great point.

523
00:43:03,725 --> 00:43:05,859
I was shortsighted in my desire for a surprise.

524
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:07,659
One moment, please.

525
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:14,159
Ji Kang Hee, let's talk later.

526
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,125
They say they can come in two hours.

527
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:23,059
Unfortunately, I have an important meeting today...

528
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:26,625
Unbelievable.

529
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,659
Are you saying I should tell them not to come then?

530
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,025
I'm available.

531
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:37,692
I'll take today's meeting and share the minutes with you.

532
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,525
I'll let you off the hook today, but moving forward I want this to be your priority.

533
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:45,459
Thank you for your understanding.

534
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:49,925
- Then, please take care of it. 
 - Yes.

535
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:52,625
I will take my leave first.

536
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,925
Please go ahead.

537
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:03,492
I'll take measurements while waiting.

538
00:44:14,512 --> 00:44:17,059
- Have we possibly… 
 - Did you sleep with me?

539
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:20,992
Wow, that's bold.

540
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,692
I was expecting something more along the lines of "Are you interested in me?"

541
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:27,692
Would you like some coffee?

542
00:44:27,692 --> 00:44:28,892
Sounds good.

543
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:32,225
I'm going to buy mine. What would you like?

544
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:56,725
Customer number 32, your order is ready.

545
00:44:56,725 --> 00:44:57,892
Thank you.

546
00:44:57,892 --> 00:44:59,525
Enjoy your drink.

547
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,192
It's on the company's card.

548
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:02,992
Thank you.

549
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:19,825
What's wrong?

550
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:22,259
- Kang Hee… 
 - Huh?

551
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:25,525
- Ji Kang Hee. 
 - Ji Kang Hee?

552
00:45:25,525 --> 00:45:27,192
- You saw her? 
 - Yeah.

553
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:28,925
Hey, where?

554
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:30,859
Where? Where?

555
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:33,759
Where? Hey, you need to find her quickly!

556
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:35,392
Hey, am I going alone?

557
00:45:35,392 --> 00:45:37,525
Come out!

558
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:02,192
Are you sure you saw her?

559
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:09,959
It was my grandfather.

560
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:11,792
No, I'm telling you it was my mother.

561
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:13,192
That's not true.

562
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:17,192
Our parents agreed to wait until we graduated from college,

563
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,959
but Grandfather rushed our marriage.

564
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:22,025
So what? That's in the past.

565
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:25,659
It's a fact that you ran away because you didn't like me.

566
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:28,192
And I became the one lucky man.

567
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:32,125
- Thank you, Seok Kyeong. 
 - Yes, thank you, Geum Seok Kyeong.

568
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:35,592
Look at you, baby! You're so gorgeous.

569
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,225
Don't do it.

570
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:41,259
- No, I can't stop it. 
 - Don't do it, I said don't.

571
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:44,092
Hey, stop it!

572
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,659
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:49,792
Shall we start the consultation?

574
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:54,659
The problem is my tastes are too diverse.

575
00:46:54,659 --> 00:47:00,225
I like a wide range of things, so I'm not sure how to explain what...

576
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:03,825
Just keywords or a mood that comes to mind?

577
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:05,759
Feel free to share them comfortably.

578
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,859
Keywords…

579
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:10,525
Fun.

580
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:11,792
Fun…

581
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:15,692
I'd like our home to be cheerful and fun.

582
00:47:15,692 --> 00:47:18,425
I grew up in a strict and rigid environment.

583
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:22,792
What do you think would be fun to do in this space?

584
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:26,825
To be honest, when I was young,

585
00:47:26,825 --> 00:47:30,292
I wanted to have my own comic room

586
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:32,492
to read comic books whenever I want to,

587
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:35,659
and to invite friends over to play games.

588
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,692
Like a rebel's hideout…

589
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:40,859
Imagine if this room was a duplex.

590
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,259
A duplex?

591
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,125
Can this place be turned into a duplex?

592
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:48,259
If we open up the slab of this room and raise the ceiling height, it's possible.

593
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:51,525
You make it a duplex and separate the spaces.

594
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:55,059
On the upper level, you could put a few bean bags

595
00:47:55,059 --> 00:48:00,225
and create a space entirely for yourself where you can read comics or books.

596
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:03,725
And on the lower level, you could play games with friends

597
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:07,592
and separate the areas so you could drink wine or coffee.

598
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:09,125
That's so...

599
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:12,125
perfect!

600
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,325
There's a term called "man cave".

601
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,859
Originally, it was a space for men's hobbies and such.

602
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:21,425
But this space wouldn't be a "man cave"

603
00:48:21,425 --> 00:48:23,725
it would be an "Esther cave".

604
00:48:23,725 --> 00:48:26,292
Esther cave…

605
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:32,692
Wow, was interior consulting always this fun?

606
00:48:32,692 --> 00:48:34,859
- Geum Seok Kyeong. 
 - Yes?

607
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:38,725
Your gift is really cool. I really like it.

608
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,825
Even more than mine, babe?

609
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:44,992
Is our Victor so cute?

610
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,025
Isn't he?

611
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,492
Yes.

612
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:00,425
   

613
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:07,625
   

614
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,125
   

615
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:17,892
Let's call it a day.

616
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:20,659
Why is she pulling an all-nighter when even we aren't?

617
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:22,159
She's just a three-month intern.

618
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,192
Does she think doing all that will buy her Mr. Mok's attention?

619
00:49:24,192 --> 00:49:26,692
In her dreams.

620
00:50:07,092 --> 00:50:08,425
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

621
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:09,359
Yes?

622
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,492
I get that you're creative and diligent,

623
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:16,392
but this design doesn't quite fit with our company.

624
00:50:18,425 --> 00:50:22,959
Is it me that doesn't fit or is it my design?

625
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,359
I'll be honest with you. I am a person with prejudices.

626
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:32,925
I think one's educational background, family, experiences, and appearance, are better.

627
00:50:32,925 --> 00:50:35,525
But I have no prejudices regarding ability.

628
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:40,059
Can someone with prejudices really evaluate ability without bias?

629
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:43,525
Isn't true ability about overcoming such prejudices?

630
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:46,225
- The client may like my proposal.
 - This crap?

631
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:48,825
I've reflected on what the client wants as much as possible

632
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:50,625
and I've analyzed their lifestyle thoroughly.

633
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:54,825
Ms. Ji Kang Hee, what do you know about the client?

634
00:50:54,825 --> 00:50:58,759
A friend gifts a 400-square-meter newlywed house as a wedding gift,

635
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:00,725
regardless of the cost.

636
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,425
It's another class.

637
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:05,359
Someone at the bottom of life, living in a goshiwon and doing manual labor,

638
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,359
couldn't possibly approach that world.

639
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:11,525
Let's not wear each other out and just stop here.

640
00:51:11,525 --> 00:51:12,859
- Mr. Kim Daniel. 
 - Yes.

641
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:16,025
- About that modern design earlier… 
 - Am I being fired right now?

642
00:51:16,025 --> 00:51:17,759
I acknowledge your CAD skills.

643
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:20,725
I'll contact you if there's any part-time work.

644
00:51:20,725 --> 00:51:22,059
Bring the proposal here.

645
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:23,492
Yes.

646
00:51:28,725 --> 00:51:30,159
Okay.

647
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,559
- I think this is quite good. 
 - Oh, yes.

648
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,992
It seems to have turned out really well in a woodsy style.

649
00:51:41,025 --> 00:51:42,659
- It's good. 
 - What?

650
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:47,192
It's unique and cozy, yet chic.

651
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:49,025
Chic?

652
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:50,959
The color combination is no joke.

653
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:54,825
If the furniture is refurbished in this style, it would look like a Mendini piece.

654
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:56,959
You met Ji Kang Hee, right?

655
00:51:56,959 --> 00:52:00,159
Did you rush off to tattle that she was fired?

656
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,860
You fired her?

657
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,050
The head designer, during the project?

658
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:13,259
What a shame.

659
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:14,425
 Bull... 

660
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:16,759
If there's a company looking for a designer, I'll reach out to you.

661
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,392
 No thanks. Just stop talking about me behind my back. 

662
00:52:19,392 --> 00:52:20,692
You'll come to visit sometimes, right?

663
00:52:20,692 --> 00:52:22,392
 Would you come if you were me? 

664
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,292
Shouldn't we at least have a farewell party?

665
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,525
You'd do that, for me?

666
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:30,325
Then, please do it.

667
00:52:30,325 --> 00:52:33,392
All right, let's set a date.

668
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:35,059
It's been a pleasure.

669
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:37,859
I'll go and greet the manager before I leave.

670
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:40,259
I'm not asking you to use Ms. Kang Hee's design.

671
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,600
I'm just asking to include it in the presentation with the other proposals,

672
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,150
how is that overstepping?

673
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,192
Do you think you're still the head of the design department?

674
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:50,525
You were demoted because you lost your touch.

675
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:52,392
Mr. Mok.

676
00:52:52,392 --> 00:52:55,125
You want me to propose this cheap design to the client?

677
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:58,359
It resembles a cheap, countryside motel!

678
00:52:58,359 --> 00:52:59,725
Take a closer look.

679
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:02,059
This design is subpar.

680
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:07,792
Ji Kang Hee, whom you brought in, is nothing more than a subpar girl from the countryside.

681
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:16,825
If I'm subpar, you can't be more than filth, Mr. Mok.

682
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:19,759
- Obsolete, just patching together other people's designs. 
 - What?

683
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:23,292
Copying and pasting anything that looks good from all sorts of archives.

684
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:25,625
Abusing your authority to take credit for thumbnails created by your team members.

685
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:28,092
- No, that's malicious. 
 - You… Are you done talking?

686
00:53:28,092 --> 00:53:31,425
While you're at it, take my stuff too.

687
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:33,325
Enough!

688
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:34,859
Take it and get out.

689
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,325
- You're fired! 
 - No!

690
00:53:37,325 --> 00:53:38,959
It's you who should be fired.

691
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:41,892
Completely out of my life!

692
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:48,892
Out!

693
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:59,859
   

694
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:02,692
 I'm sorry for the opportunity you gave me. 

695
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:05,192
 It's not Kang Hee's fault, I'll somehow… 

696
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:06,759
 No. 

697
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:10,792
 It's more comfortable and honorable to sweat at a construction site. 

698
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:14,225
 I will stop here. 

699
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:14,859
 I didn't come to Seoul to live like this. 

700
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:25,559
 I didn't abandon you to live such a lousy life. 

701
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:37,225
 Did you know? Family members can't get married. 

702
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:40,025
 Why get married when we're already family? 

703
00:56:40,825 --> 00:56:44,659
 No. I'm going marry you.  

704
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:48,659
 Marry me, Kang Hee. 

705
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,859
 What are you saying? 

706
00:56:50,859 --> 00:56:54,359
 Huh? It's snowing. 

707
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:04,125
 Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo, did you know? 

708
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:07,325
 If you eat the first snow ten times, 

709
00:57:07,325 --> 00:57:09,325
 you'll be with your first love. 

710
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,092
 Really? 

711
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,292
 One. 

712
00:57:15,425 --> 00:57:17,125
 Two. 

713
00:57:27,092 --> 00:57:28,825
 Ten times. 

714
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:32,425
 I ate it ten times. 

715
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:35,892
 You're going to marry me now, right? 

716
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:38,059
 Oh dear, you fool. 

717
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,959
 Chubby bear. 

718
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:55,040
    
 ♫  Stay by my side  ♫

719
00:57:55,050 --> 00:58:01,560
♫  Like the rain that always falls  ♫

720
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:07,220
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

721
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,630
♫  Let's chat under the crescent moon  ♫

722
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:18,640
♫  You're still everything to me  ♫

723
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:26,920
♫  Please be my forest, embrace me  ♫

724
00:58:26,925 --> 00:58:29,292
I'm going crazy.

725
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:31,620
I think of it whenever it snows.

726
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:38,060
♫  and embrace your tender heart   ♫

727
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:56,925
Yeon Soo.

728
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:00,625
Why aren't you answering the phone?

729
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:15,692
♪ My old hometown is a mountain village where flowers bloom ♪

730
00:59:15,692 --> 00:59:22,908
♪ Peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, baby azaleas ♪

731
00:59:22,908 --> 00:59:29,925
♪ A village adorned with colorful flower palaces ♪

732
00:59:29,925 --> 00:59:36,320
♪ I miss the times I played there ♪

733
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:43,925
♪ A village where willows dance by the stream ♪

734
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:51,025
♪ I miss the times I played there ♪

735
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:58,792
It's a song Grandfather has always loved.

736
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:03,959
He held on well just to see you.

737
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,592
Let's bid our farewell.

738
01:00:08,592 --> 01:00:12,392
I'll take care of the rest, don't worry.

739
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:16,092
Thank you, sir.

740
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,370
   

741
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,292
   

742
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:52,192
People who said would come, didn't.

743
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:56,025
   

744
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:58,259
Kang Hee should come, too.

745
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:01,092
You think she'd come? She's been out of touch for 10 years.

746
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:04,192
She has to. She's practically his granddaughter.

747
01:01:04,192 --> 01:01:06,892
Grandfather loved her so much.

748
01:01:06,892 --> 01:01:12,059
I heard Ahjusshi contacted her, but there was no response.

749
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,025
That Ji Kang Hee, seriously…

750
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:15,860
If she really doesn't show up this time,

751
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,350
I'm going to cut ties with her.

752
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:21,592
Honestly, I hope she doesn't come.

753
01:01:24,192 --> 01:01:25,970
Yeon Soo is just starting to live well.

754
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,992
If Kang Hee comes and shakes things up again…

755
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:32,225
What can we do, that poor kid?

756
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:42,459
I'll have a drink for him.

757
01:01:42,459 --> 01:01:45,125
Hey, easy. I can't hold much liquor.

758
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:47,192
Oh, that's enough.

759
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:50,825
He was bedridden for a long time, wasn't he?

760
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:52,492
- That's right. 
 - Yes, that's right.

761
01:01:52,492 --> 01:01:55,992
They say Yeon Soo didn't even cry.

762
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:57,530
He must be in shock, you know.

763
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,490
How could he be in the right state of mind?

764
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:02,359
Why did Soon Ja choose to get married now, of all times?

765
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:04,559
It's not Soon Ja, it's Su Ji!

766
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,125
And what do you mean, "of all times"?

767
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,325
Should she have pushed back her marriage just because her father is bedridden?

768
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,059
Chun Pil taking the role of the chief mourner is enough. What's the issue?

769
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:13,792
But Chun Pil must have contacted Kang Hee, right?

770
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:15,692
- He must have. 
 - Anyway,

771
01:02:15,692 --> 01:02:19,192
I wonder how Kang Hee has changed.

772
01:02:19,192 --> 01:02:20,825
You think that temper of hers would've left her?

773
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:24,025
We called her Gang Hee for a reason.

774
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:26,492
Ah, right, Gang Hee.

775
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,825
Hey! Hey! Hey!

776
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:30,292
- Ji Kang Hee is here. Ji Kang Hee. 
 - Hey, Ji Kang Hee! Ji Kang Hee!

777
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,825
Hey, Ji Kang Hee is here! Ji Kang Hee!

778
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:33,792
- What? 
 - Kang Hee is here!

779
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,459
- What are you talking about? 
 - No, I said Kang Hee came.

780
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:38,025
- Why would she come here? 
 - I'm telling you, she really came.

781
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:40,559
She really came.

782
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:44,525
- I'm telling you, Kang Hee really came. 
 - No, she really is here.

783
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:54,125
Where is Ji Kang Hee?

784
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,350
♫  What if I was wrong  ♫

785
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:19,125
♫  You were my everything  ♫

786
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:23,059
 As a child, she was a troublemaker, but now that she's grown up, who knows? 

787
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:26,159
 The bigger she gets, the more she resembles her mom. 

788
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:29,925
 That's why either Soon Ja or Chun Pil, one of them should have left the neighborhood. 

789
01:03:29,925 --> 01:03:33,892
 Shush, she'll hear you. What are we going to do if she goes crazy again? 

790
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:43,120
♫  You told me about your everything, your whispers are all my favorite thing  ♫

791
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:50,600
♫  I think I fell in love with you, but how can I forget you?  ♫

792
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:56,300
♫  You stayed close in the every day, you made me realize and find my dream  ♫

793
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:04,330
♫  Like you shining in the dark, I'll be standing next to you  ♫

794
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:15,792
Excuse me. Hey, let me go!

795
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:17,292
Kang Hee!

796
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,459
Grandfather has…

797
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,859
Grandfather passed away, Kang Hee.

798
01:04:50,825 --> 01:04:52,459
Cheon Yeon Soo?

799
01:04:57,325 --> 01:05:00,992
   

800
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:13,800


801
01:05:17,907 --> 01:05:20,049
   

802
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:23,068
 I haven't seen any of those girls who left for the city turn out well. 

803
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:26,748
 Live together with any man and splurge on luxury goods. 

804
01:05:26,748 --> 01:05:30,144
 Whether I eat instant noodles in a room on the outskirts or carry luxury items, 

805
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:31,716
 I'm taking responsibility for my own life. 

806
01:05:31,716 --> 01:05:35,096
 The neighborhood was all quiet without her. 

807
01:05:35,096 --> 01:05:38,364
 If you don't want to see your mom die, never get involved with her. 

808
01:05:38,364 --> 01:05:41,495
 You're the first woman to treat me this way. 

809
01:05:41,495 --> 01:05:43,019
 By any chance, are you the girlfriend? 

810
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:44,879
 - Yeon Soo's girlfriend. 
 - Yeon Soo? 

811
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:47,576
 Do you happen to know what he's doing on Christmas Eve? 

812
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,865
 Then, do you want to go check out the top floor's suite? 

813
01:05:49,865 --> 01:05:50,972
 Can I ask you a favor? 

814
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:54,464
 There is a man claiming ownership of me. 

815
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:56,874
 I want to get away from that man.
