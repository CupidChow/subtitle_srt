1
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:28,100


2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,410
   

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,067
Yeon Soo, is it okay for friends to kiss?

4
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,267
Why would you kiss among friends?

5
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,767
You're crossing the line.

6
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,733
You're really a friend.

7
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,600
My friend, thanks for the gift.

8
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,567
- Let's just have a drink. 
 - Alcohol?

9
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,400
It's a housewarming party, of course we have to drink.

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,233
You can't drink alcohol?

11
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:51,667
What do you take me for?

12
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,200
Look at my height and my build,

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,700
whoever I drink with, I've never lost.

14
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,167
That's great.

15
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,033
Let's give it a go today.

16
00:01:59,033 --> 00:01:59,933
Let's go all the way.

17
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,333
- Deal! 
 - Deal!

18
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,333
Rock, paper, scissors!

19
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,867
Rock, paper, scissors! Paper!

20
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,800
Set it up.

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,033
   

22
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,500
- Yeah, why? 
  - Where are you? 

23
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,900
Where else would I be? At the convenience store.

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,300
Good timing, there's something you need to buy on the way.

25
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,733
 What is it? 

26
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,500
Never mind. I'll buy it when you come later. Without this at night…

27
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,267
- I bought it. 
  - You did? 

28
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,600
 Well, it is your house, after all. 

29
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:36,800
We're on the same page, after all.

30
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,033
Is it here?

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,067
- What is? 
 - What?

32
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,200
Where's the lightbulb?

33
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,100
- The lightbulb? 
 - The one over there has burned out.

34
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,500
Weren't you supposed to buy that?

35
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,733
What do you mean? How are we on the same page, exactly?

36
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,167
Instant noodles!

37
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,900
You like instant noodles, don't you?

38
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,700
I thought we should eat it if we get hungry later.

39
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,033
With just this one?

40
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:09,700
It's okay. I'll buy it in a moment.

41
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,033
Ah, it's fine. We can change the lightbulb later.

42
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,867
I'll be quick. Have it set up.

43
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,200
If it's the lightbulb, say so. Don't make it so confusing.

44
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,267
Ah, that clueless teddy bear…

45
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,800
That's it. Is there anything else to help with?

46
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,333
Huh?

47
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,533
No.

48
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:24,933
That's right, Kang Hee.

49
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:28,633
Reminiscing about the old days, I bought this, too.

50
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,100
Ah, don't do it!

51
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,267
Why? You did this to me, too.

52
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,433
Are you taking revenge on me now?

53
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you going to do everything I did?

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,833
Should I?

55
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,467
That's childish.

56
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,700
Ah, it's so cozy.

57
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,533
Come here.

58
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,533
What for?

59
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,400
Hurry up!

60
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,233
I'm here.

61
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,000
Kang Hee.

62
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,867
Will you sleep with me?

63
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,833
 Come here. 

64
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,533
 Yeon Soo. 

65
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,833
 Will you sleep with me? 

66
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,333
Hey!

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Why are you so surprised? It was just a joke.

68
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,333
Wow! Cheon Yeon Soo!

69
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,033
Are you really Cheon Yeon Soo?

70
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,067
- Of course, it's me. 
 - Doesn't seem like it?

71
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,867
Seems like we need to check?

72
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,633
Ah! What are you saying? It hurts.

73
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,700
Don't do it, don't! Hey!

74
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,800
You're not Cheon Yeon Soo, are you?

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,033
Oh, using force? You'll get in trouble! Let's see who's stronger!

76
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,867
Ah! It hurts! It hurts!

77
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:49,000
Ah, don't do it!

78
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,900
 Yeon Soo. 

79
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,667
 Will you sleep with me? 

80
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,200
Does it hurt?

81
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,267
Let's not overdo it.

82
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,933
We're friends.

83
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,000
Friends.

84
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,067
You were spying on me when I was changing the light bulb.

85
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,700
No, I wasn't.

86
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,000
I stared openly, you know?

87
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,200
You're bold, Ji Kang Hee.

88
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,867
That's what a supervisor does.

89
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,833
Checking your work.

90
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,967
Professional consciousness. Professional.

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,067
Right! If you need to change the bulb in the future, just call me.

92
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:20,533
If I call, will you come?

93
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,667
Of course!

94
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,500
If not me, some other guy will come and change it.

95
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,600
So what?

96
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,433
Hey, you think I came to change the bulb and ended up drinking like this? What?

97
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,067
For the past ten years, we lived without caring for each other.

98
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,500
Why the sudden nosiness now?

99
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,267
Who says we lived without caring?

100
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,533
What?

101
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,367
You must have done that.

102
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,400
I…

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,967
My daily routine was...

104
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:05,033
hoping Ji Kang Hee was happy when I woke up in the morning.

105
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:11,000
Even when I came home exhausted after all night,

106
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:15,233
I prayed and hoped that Ji Kang Hee was happy.

107
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,533
I managed to live well on my own.

108
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,367
You didn't have to...

109
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,200
What about you?

110
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,967
Didn't you think of me?

111
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,633
I was your first man.

112
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,233
Hey, you're drunk.

113
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,400
I'm not drunk, okay?

114
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,933
You're drunk.

115
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,667
Ugh, fine!

116
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,433
I'm drunk! I'm drunk!

117
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,500
Ji Kang Hee must be happy.

118
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,967
Strong with drinks and many men.

119
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,133
How many men from Seoul have you dated?

120
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,400
Why count them?

121
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,267
Wow! Looks like you've met too many to count.

122
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,733
Ah? What are you saying?

123
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,633
Hey, stop drinking.

124
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,833
I'll get some cold water.

125
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,333
Have I changed, for real?

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
You have changed.

127
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,167
How and where have I changed?

128
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,667
Was the old me better?

129
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,833
Should I gain weight again?

130
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,867
In the past,

131
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,033
here,

132
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,667
and here,

133
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,000
here too.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,933
Everything was all soft and fluffy.

135
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,533
No matter how sharp I was,

136
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,567
you took it all in.

137
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,300
Wait a minute, I need to use the bathroom.

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,700
Come out quickly, Ji Kang Hee.

139
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,333
I want to see you soon.

140
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:35,267
Yeon Soo. What are you doing?

141
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,700
Yeon Soo?

142
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,733
Are you really sleeping?

143
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,300
Wake up!

144
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,100
So annoying!

145
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,767
Are you awake?

146
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,700
You're sleeping well.

147
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,700
How can you fall asleep? Huh?

148
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,067
Ugh!

149
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,400
Ugh, seriously. Just stay still.

150
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:54,233
Wow, what a cool pose.

151
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,233
I hope you had a happy day today.

152
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,167
Good night, Kang Hee.

153
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,667
Wake up.

154
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,000
 Did you sleep well? 

155
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,867
It's a dream.

156
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,667
Kang Hee is smiling.

157
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,233
 It's not a dream, you know? 

158
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't want to wake up.

159
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,100
I can even hear her voice.

160
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,467
Wake up while I ask nicely.

161
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,433
Get up! Get up!

162
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,000
What is it?

163
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,733
What time is it? What is it?

164
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,733
Hey, was I asleep? You should've woken me up!

165
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:52,100
Wake you up? What for?

166
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,600
You're such a lightweight.

167
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,233
Don't go around drinking alcohol anywhere.

168
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,067
Are you mad because I was sleeping?

169
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,433
Why would I be mad?

170
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,470
You said you were a good drinker, so I bought a lot.

171
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,833
My stomach hurts from drinking it all by myself.

172
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,867
Hurry up and get up. Let's go and have some hangover soup.

173
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,767
Okay.

174
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,800
Just a moment.

175
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:23,600
Ah, I'm crazy. I should have held back.

176
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,767
Ah! I couldn't hold back from that?

177
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,433
Ah, my head.

178
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,100
Why are you coming out from there?

179
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,800
Why are you coming out from over there, Mr. Geum Seok Kyeong?

180
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,433
Were the two of you together?

181
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,000
Were you the next-door neighbor?

182
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
It's a dormitory, so we live next door.

183
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,467
We're old school friends from the same town. I could let him stay for a night.

184
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:07,133
I asked first… Why are you answering Mr. Yeon Soo first?

185
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,467
Wow! That's really childish, right?

186
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,367
There was no such talk at the company yesterday.

187
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,467
You said you were going straight to Hana-eup.

188
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,133
Didn't I say I'd be waiting in front of the company?

189
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,100
Stop it.

190
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,033
Let's stop.

191
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,833
Don't tell me you two slept together?

192
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,467
Yes, we slept.

193
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,800
What else would you do at night if not sleep?

194
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,733
And Mr. Geum Seok Kyeong, didn't you sleep?

195
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,067
Ah, yes, I slept too.

196
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:38,033
Stop joking, Cheon Yeon Soo.

197
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,533
Nothing happened, okay?

198
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,667
What would happen between friends…

199
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
You're hesitant.

200
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,500
If I finish this, should I get up first?

201
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,967
Ah, I really want to say it, but I can't.

202
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,633
Because Little Heart might hear.

203
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:10,067
Shouldn't you only hear good things during prenatal care?

204
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,267
Little Heart is cool like me.

205
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,633
He'll automatically pick out what he wants to hear.

206
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:17,033
What is it?

207
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
Count to three.

208
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,167
One, two…

209
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,633
I…

210
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:26,867
am jealous.

211
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,367
What?

212
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,767
Ms. Kang Hee, definitely said she was going to Hana-eup yesterday.

213
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:35,700
This morning, she came out of the house with a man.

214
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,300
- A man? Who's the man? 
 - Cheon Yeon Soo.

215
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,600
That's it, so what?

216
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,867
That's why.

217
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:46,200
We also slept in the same condo several times on business trips.

218
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,567
I mean yes, but…

219
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,567
I asked if they slept together.

220
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,867
Really?

221
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,400
Did you really ask that?

222
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,500
Yeah. Why did I do that?

223
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,900
You must have been very anxious, Seok Kyeong.

224
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,467
Indeed, Cheon Yeon Soo is really cool.

225
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:13,300
He's tall, good-looking, and manly.

226
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,600
Cool? Who?

227
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,733
No, I mean, after all, it's just a first love.

228
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,800
A common first love that everyone has.

229
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,567
So, why can't you go to her, despite being so confident?

230
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,133
I'll go. I said I will,

231
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,900
after drinking this.

232
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,067
Does that man matter?

233
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,433
Why make excuses?

234
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,033
Whatever that man is, why do you care?

235
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:41,933
Even if we're friends, touching on that topic is a bit much.

236
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,333
There was nothing. We said nothing happened.

237
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,367
How is that an excuse?

238
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,067
Hey, about yesterday…

239
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:54,733
I've been unable to sleep well due to the difficult deliveries of the cows every dawn.

240
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,800
I couldn't sleep for two days again this time.

241
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,000
That's why I didn't drive and came by bus instead.

242
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,833
Did I say anything?

243
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,033
Because I met you on the bus, I couldn't even sleep.

244
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,700
Gosh. I'm sorry.

245
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,267
I disrupted your precious sleep.

246
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,367
No, I mean, I didn't sleep because I wanted to.

247
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,833
My house must not have been that uncomfortable.

248
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,700
You even snored loudly as you fell asleep.

249
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,800
- When did I snore? 
 - I couldn't sleep because it was noisy.

250
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,667
What? Do you have proof?

251
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,967
You said you had things to do. I'll go back down.

252
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,333
I'll give you a ride.

253
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,233
It's fine.

254
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,033
I'm going.

255
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,033
Kang Hee.

256
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:59,500
Hey, Ji Kang Hee! Get off.

257
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
What?

258
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,200
Come out. This way.

259
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,433
I'm sorry.

260
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,900
Come quickly.

261
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,167
- Aren't you going? 
 - No, sir, I'm sorry.

262
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,500
Yes.

263
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,933
- Please drive safely. 
 - Yes.

264
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,467
Why?

265
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,100
Let's hang out just one more day.

266
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:31,833
If I had followed you to Seoul,

267
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,833
I'm curious what it would have been like.

268
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,700
Let's try it.

269
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:47,567
Yes, let's see if we can...

270
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,667
start again.

271
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,400
Make sure the volume never goes down.

272
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,700
Oh, rest assured.

273
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,533
What's this?

274
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,267
 Mom, something urgent came up. I can't go to the performance today. 

275
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:04,433
 I'm sorry. 

276
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,167
What is this?

277
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,267
Can't go to the performance…

278
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,367
What's he up to?

279
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,467
What, Yeon Soo?

280
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:17,200
Is this about not wanting to do a proposal?

281
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,500
He did seem quite hesitant.

282
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,800
If the proposal doesn't happen…

283
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,433
What about the marriage?

284
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:28,600
What in the world is he thinking?

285
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,730
  The person you have called is not available— 

286
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,900
This kid! There's definitely something going on.

287
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,367
Hey, where are you going without your hair done?

288
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,467
Is my hair the issue now?

289
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,633
Oh my, you!

290
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:44,400
 Ms. Yoon, something urgent came up. I don't think I can make it today. 

291
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,167
 I'm sorry. 

292
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:53,300
- Madam. 
 - Ms. Yoon.

293
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,467
You know about today's performance, right?

294
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,467
When are you going?

295
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,233
Yes, Madam.

296
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,533
About that performance,

297
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:05,900
I don't think I can make it today due to some urgent matters.

298
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,533
You must have had high expectations. I'm really sorry.

299
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,500
Where is Yeon Soo now?

300
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,367
The director went to Seoul yesterday.

301
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:20,533
Yesterday? Yesterday? Why?

302
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:24,100
Please leave, Madam.

303
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
- Where is Kang Hee? 
 - You can't come in here.

304
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,800
Where is Kang Hee?

305
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,233
Ah, did you come to meet the manager?

306
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,800
She went to Seoul, yesterday.

307
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,367
What?

308
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,500
Hey, drink it.

309
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,133
I went to the construction site, and they said Ji Kang Hee also went to Seoul.

310
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,767
Why are you like this again?

311
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,167
Just sit quietly and finish up your hair.

312
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,933
No.

313
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,500
My intuition is accurate.

314
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,767
Hey, take this out quickly.

315
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:00,467
My fate is going to dry out by the time my hair dries.

316
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:03,133
What's making you feel so anxious now?

317
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:07,467
They are definitely together.

318
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm telling you, my intuition is right.

319
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:50,200
You. How did you know about this place?

320
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,533
Be honest. You've been here, haven't you?

321
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,400
With a girl.

322
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,500
Won't you speak? You're acting weird.

323
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,000
Eating together like this brings back old memories.

324
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,267
It tastes good after not having it for a while.

325
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,300
For a while?

326
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,533
   

327
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,500
Is he your boyfriend?

328
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,267
A childhood friend from my hometown.

329
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,467
Does that make sense?

330
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:32,133
You're just friends with someone who looks like that?

331
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:36,600
Can I show him the room where I used to live?

332
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,433
You're not even moving in, so no.

333
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,667
Oh, please don't be like that.

334
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,900
Can't I just look around a bit and then leave?

335
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,233
I'll be quiet and then leave.

336
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:51,800
Yes, take your time and look around comfortably.

337
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,867
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

338
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
This is your first time at a goshiwon, isn't it?

339
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,400
It's quite cozy.

340
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,233
Still, it's livable once you get used to it.

341
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:21,500
There's also a rooftop here. It's pretty decent.

342
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,633
When was it?

343
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,700
It was when I was laid off from the company.

344
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:38,867
Just then, the boiler exploded, and the water supply stopped working.

345
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,433
But then, I got a call from Ah Reum.

346
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:46,033
Ah Reum asked if she could stay for just one night.

347
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,700
How could I let her stay?

348
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,567
Wouldn't it have been better if you two slept together?

349
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:56,067
How could two people sleep together when they couldn't even lie down?

350
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,033
Shall I lie down and check?

351
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,367
Hey, you can't even stretch out your legs.

352
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,033
But I did stretch them out.

353
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,767
Your head is up high.

354
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,833
This is my pillow.

355
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,867
You lie down, too.

356
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,900
Ugh, hey.

357
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,333
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

358
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:36,033
Kang Hee, should I get you a drink?

359
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,933
It's okay.

360
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:45,733
You saw everything, right?

361
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,200
Yes.

362
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,767
   

363
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,567
What? You haven't left yet?

364
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,967
Ma'am, I'm going to return to Seoul.

365
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,700
Why all of a sudden?

366
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,800
Because I don't want to go to Hana-eup.

367
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,567
I can't take the countryside life anymore.

368
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:10,067
You said not to touch the Hana-eup project and to leave it to you.

369
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,233
Why? What happened?

370
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,500
There are some reasons for it.

371
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,900
No, just go.

372
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,167
Why? I've been there long enough.

373
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,167
- It's not beautiful. 
 - What?

374
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,933
What do you think is the ultimate beauty?

375
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,900
The beauty of a good finish.

376
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,033
Not giving up on something you started and carrying it through to the end.

377
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,967
How beautiful is that.

378
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:37,167
That's why I'm going to see it through to the end.

379
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,800
Where to?

380
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,733
As far as my instinct takes me.

381
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,067
Do you perhaps mean Mr. Ji Chun Pil?

382
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:50,700
The beauty of a good finish! Go down right now.

383
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,767
You're doing well.

384
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,567
I won.

385
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,600
- You're happy? 
- Yeah.

386
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,690
- Follow me. 
 - Is it 1 to 0?

387
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:27,410
♫  Why do I end up thinking of you every night?  ♫

388
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:34,460
♫  What's clear is I'm putting in a lot of effort for you  ♫

389
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,200
It's really dazzling! So dazzling!

390
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,133
This one, too.

391
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,867
Two each?

392
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,200
The last one.

393
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,567
You saw it, didn't you?

394
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:54,033
Your condition must be good, since you slept so soundly.

395
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,500
I said I'm sorry.

396
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,667
Take this and keep it, okay?

397
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,433
- Is it mine? 
 - Yes, take it.

398
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,400
The teddy bear in my room is mine,

399
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,260
so leave this one in your room.

400
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,100
Since you picked this one out, it's yours.

401
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,033
That stupid bear was originally mine. Give it back.

402
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,467
No, it's mine. Okay?

403
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:15,333
It's mine! It has always been mine.

404
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,433
You left it behind.

405
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,267
When did I leave it? It's mine!

406
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:21,300
I've had it for a much longer time.

407
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,733
It's 3 to 0.

408
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,900
Ah, what should I do?

409
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Heart. Heart!

410
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,933
Ha…

411
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,567
There's a teddy bear!

412
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,633
Actually, I recommended that to your father.

413
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:39,233
I told him that you liked teddy bears.

414
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,133
What?

415
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,800
You know the condom I gave you that time.

416
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Could that really have been a motel promotion item?

417
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,000
Well…

418
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:55,267
Ah, really! There isn't a single one that came out right.

419
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:57,933
- Why? It came out well, it's pretty. 
 - Can't you even make a proper heart?

420
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:01,133
No, it's just that the direction is different for you and me, that's all.

421
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,333
This won't do.

422
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,500
All five of us can come next time and take a photo together.

423
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,800
I wonder if we can all fit in the picture.

424
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Just take the picture when I say so. Why don't you listen?

425
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,933
I have been listening all along.

426
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:15,500
Ah Reum, it was not me. We have a picture for…

427
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,167
Kang Hee, you're really having fun, aren't you?

428
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,533
Who are you talking about?

429
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:27,300
Are you with our Yeon Soo?

430
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,100
Give the phone to Yeon Soo right now!

431
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,300
You shouldn't do this here. Please give me the phone.

432
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,433
- Let go! 
  - Please, give it to me quickly! 

433
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,800
   

434
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,233
Let's go.

435
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,500
They're together. I'm sure!

436
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,800
What's wrong with being together? It's nice to live like that,

437
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,000
relying on each other.

438
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,700
What if they develop feelings?

439
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,900
What are you saying?

440
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm not doing this without a reason.

441
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,967
Does that make sense to you, Chun Pil?

442
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,700
Half the world is men and the other half women.

443
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,300
Why does it have to be those two?

444
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,400
They're not even in any kind of relationship yet.

445
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,333
Can't you just watch and see how it goes?

446
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:21,300
Chun Pil, you are always like this.

447
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,800
I warned you even back then.

448
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,200
Make sure Kang Hee's mother and Yeon Soo's father never meet.

449
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:33,900
You ignored me and said they weren't in that kind of relationship.

450
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,700
But what happened then?

451
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:40,433
They eloped because they fell for each other.

452
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,667
Did you know that?

453
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,867
Ten years ago,

454
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,090
if you had followed me to Seoul then,

455
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,130
we might have been finished a long time ago.

456
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,867
Would it have been like that?

457
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,933
We were young back then,

458
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,367
but things are different now.

459
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,967
The rumors following us,

460
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:18,200
the stares, the finger-pointing,

461
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,100
we could ignore all that.

462
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:28,133
But, Yeon Soo,

463
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,733
we can't change our parents.

464
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,967
Neither you nor me.

465
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:59,000
If only you had lived well with Kang Hee's mother back then,

466
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,633
I would be happy with Yeon Soo's father.

467
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,300
Who knows if we would've had a happy ending?

468
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,367
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

469
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,967
I'm not blaming you now.

470
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:18,767
But Kang Hee and Yeon Soo's relationship it's simply impossible.

471
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:21,067
Just keep that in mind.

472
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,467
What are you going to say to your mom?

473
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:43,233
I'll explain it well.

474
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,767
Everything will be all right.

475
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:48,033
Do you think I don't know her?

476
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,533
It won't be fine.

477
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:57,167
We have to be all right.

478
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:03,133
We're friends, after all.

479
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,467
Mom.

480
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,500
I knew this would happen.

481
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,800
Mom, we met by chance on the bus. Isn't it a coincidence?

482
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,567
Lies!

483
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,733
You tell me.

484
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:57,700
Would you believe it if I told you?

485
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,067
What?

486
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,033
Hey, that…

487
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,100
Hey!

488
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,300
- Mom! 
 - Hey!

489
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,500
- What are you doing? 
 - Lies, lies!

490
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,567
- Listen to me, please. 
 - Hey, you!

491
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,100
 The power is off… 

492
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,400
His phone is turned off.

493
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Kang Hee's phone is turned off, too?

494
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,400
They couldn't possibly be together for real, could they?

495
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,500
Something is definitely off.

496
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,600
When Ms. Su Ji called earlier,

497
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,700
Kang Hee said she was talking to someone about me.

498
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,567
Could it really be Yeon Soo?

499
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:31,800
You're her best friend, so she probably talks about you a lot.

500
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Gosh! You always take Kang Hee's side, don't you?

501
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Hey, let's say Ji Kang Hee could do that.

502
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,400
But what about Yeon Soo, do you trust Yeon Soo?

503
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,100
If the two of them are in Seoul right now, you think

504
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,300
Yeon Soo is saying "Ah, this is water! That's a stone! It's Ji Kang Hee!"

505
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,933
When the love of his life he's been waiting for is right in front of his eyes?

506
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,900
Come on, be honest. From a man's perspective.

507
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,200
See, Kang Hee comes alone.

508
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,800
Kang Hee, I'm sorry. You were really startled earlier, right?

509
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,100
You know how she is.

510
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,500
Hey! It was a misunderstanding, right?

511
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,067
You weren't with Yeon Soo.

512
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:12,333
Yeon Soo slept in my house.

513
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:20,233
Hey, Kang Hee! Were you really with Yeon Soo?

514
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:24,100
No, hey!

515
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,467
Hey, Ji Kang Hee!

516
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:31,100
Did you really go to Seoul with Yeon Soo?

517
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,600
You know you can tell me.

518
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,700
You know that I am always on your side.

519
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,900
If I tell you, all of them will know.

520
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,767
Then everyone in Hana-eup will know.

521
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:49,867
So, are you seeing Yeon Soo again, by any chance?

522
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,000
You also slept in my house.

523
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,267
How is Yeon Soo any different?

524
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,100
Got it.

525
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,200
If you have something you want to say later, tell me then.

526
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,700
- You got it? 
 - Yes.

527
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,167
I'm leaving. Rest well.

528
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,167
Huh? Director, you left early today.

529
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,467
Uh?

530
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,600
This little guy eats well.

531
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,100
Maybe because he's so carefree, he sleeps well and recovers quickly.

532
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,833
I should start looking for a place to send him for adoption.

533
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:40,433
Director, about the performance…

534
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,100
I didn't plan to watch it.

535
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
If you didn't plan to go either,

536
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,500
why did you send the tickets?

537
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,167
It's confusing.

538
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,333
Uh, that…

539
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,100
I think my mother did that because she wants us to get together quickly.

540
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,900
So, it was sent by your mother?

541
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,100
The flowers, too?

542
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,467
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

543
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,100
Director,

544
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,500
we should probably wrap things up quickly.

545
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,200
Shall I do it with the one I prepared? Or should we go with the one you prepared?

546
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,400
Listen, Ms. Yoon.

547
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,900
You do realize this request is truly unreasonable, right?

548
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,100
But, could we delay the explanation a bit?

549
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,200
Why?

550
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,133
It just doesn't seem like the right time now.

551
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:49,700
Why is it not the right time?

552
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,600
I think it's exactly the right time, though.

553
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,400
If we say we've broken up now,

554
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,467
all the blame will be poured on Kang Hee.

555
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:07,000
You seem to only care about her.

556
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,900
I'm truly sorry.

557
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,500
Let's do it after Kang Hee leaves.

558
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,400
If there is any criticism, I'll take it all.

559
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,500
And if there is anything to be responsible for, I'll take all the responsibility, so…

560
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,267
I don't understand why we should do that.

561
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:23,867
Wouldn't it be better to take the criticism and responsibility now?

562
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:30,067
The longer it goes on, the harder it gets for you, too. Right?

563
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,930
Hello! How are you?

564
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,110
   

565
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:45,967
Director Geum didn't come with you?

566
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,500
No.

567
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:51,833
Director Geum has heard the rumors, too.

568
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,967
I don't think a ring is right.

569
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,300
Really?

570
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,367
Just go with something ordinary.

571
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,633
Hey! How about these earrings?

572
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:14,600
Why? These are nice to wear on a regular basis.

573
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:18,300
- This. 
 - Hey, it's too much.

574
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,800
It's more excessive than a ring.

575
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,400
If I'm going to buy a gift, it should be something a country vet could never afford.

576
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,100
I thought we were playing fair.

577
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,800
Is this fair play to you right now?

578
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,800
I can win without this.

579
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,900
This is just…

580
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,633
Like the champagne of victory.

581
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,467
I'll take this one, please.

582
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:42,100
The two of them got off the same bus.

583
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:46,600
Chun Pil, I couldn't sleep.

584
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Let the kids handle their own affairs,

585
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,200
and let us live our lives now.

586
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,267
Ah, seriously!

587
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,100
No way!

588
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,700
I can't do that until at least one of them gets married.

589
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,800
Why do we have the same ancestral rites?

590
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,900
The people in Hana-eup are all going to gossip and point fingers.

591
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,000
Why does our Yeon Soo have to go through that?

592
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,833
Since when have you been worried about Yeon Soo?

593
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:18,600
Since when?

594
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,367
Am I not his mother?

595
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:23,400
Well, someone who's so worried about Yeon Soo

596
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,200
leaves the entire upbringing of Yeon Soo to his grandpa? Huh?

597
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,067
Do you know how many times Yeon Soo took a leave of absence because of your divorces?

598
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,700
And because he was taking care of his grandpa?

599
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:39,633
And what were you doing?

600
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,500
- What? 
 - When Yeon Soo's father died,

601
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,533
you made the promise

602
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:47,100
that you would take care of my father,

603
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,600
and told me not to worry and to live my life.

604
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,100
Are you sorry?

605
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,267
Why did you marry a woman who is unfaithful?

606
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:00,900
She's not that kind of woman, okay?

607
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,200
- I said she's not. 
 - She's not?

608
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,467
Everyone knows, but you're the only one denying it. Why?

609
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:11,700
Kang Hee is just like her mother, too.

610
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,300
Coming from Seoul with a man,

611
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,200
and then dares to look at my Yeon Soo?

612
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,800
Oh my!

613
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,500
Hey! Park Soon Ja!

614
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,200
Snap out of it, you!

615
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,500
Trying to change your miserable and pitiful life by changing your name.

616
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,533
What's changed after you changed your name?

617
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:34,033
What is it?

618
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:38,333
If you keep this up, I'll call you Park Soon Ja!

619
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:41,600
When people whisper about the kids,

620
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,400
we should try to understand and just let it be,

621
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,000
instead of pointing fingers and trying to divide them.

622
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,200
So what is it, then?

623
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,500
Honestly, while you worry like that,

624
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,000
have you ever thought about how much Yeon Soo or Kang Hee might be worrying?

625
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,900
Chun Pil! How could you do this to me?

626
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,500
As if you've done anything, right!

627
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,300
How long are you going to keep this up?

628
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:13,333
Chun Pil, just watch!

629
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:17,633
Hey!

630
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:21,033
Did I say something wrong?

631
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,800
Hello! I'd like to visit a patient.

632
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,567
Park Soon Ja… No, Park Su Ji.

633
00:45:29,567 --> 00:45:32,733
- You can go that way. 
 - Thank you.

634
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,100
Mom, are you okay?

635
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,067
Yeon Soo,

636
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:59,967
you… move out from the motel right now.

637
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,567
Okay, I'll go home.

638
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:10,300
Well, that's a bit…

639
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:16,233
I need my privacy, so look for another place.

640
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:20,767
Aren't there other motels?

641
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:24,733
Or kick Kang Hee out.

642
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:26,367
That's Kang Hee's home, Mom.

643
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:31,367
When she first came, she went to a different motel with that guy.

644
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,267
Mom, by any chance,

645
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:41,600
did you file the complaint against the construction site?

646
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,733
Do you think it was just me?

647
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:47,333
The people of Hana-eup all agreed.

648
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,333
What on earth did Kang Hee do wrong that you're going this far?

649
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,833
She's that woman's daughter.

650
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:59,833
The woman who seduced your father and led him to his death.

651
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,433
If you put it that way, then it was you first.

652
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,433
The day Kang Hee's little brother died.

653
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,967
You called out her father, right?

654
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,300
Is that the same thing?

655
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,133
Chun Pil and I are pretty much like siblings.

656
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:21,733
- Those two are… 
 - Us too.

657
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:24,700
I'm just friends with Kang Hee. Just friends.

658
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,000
We can't even be friends?

659
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,233
You can't do it. It's not allowed.

660
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:32,400
If you keep circling around Kang Hee like that,

661
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,867
this ward will become my room, for life.

662
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,467
Deok Gu, did you join too?

663
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,200
Chun Pil,

664
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,900
what good would it do if people start digging up the past again?

665
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,967
No.

666
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:57,900
How should I say this?

667
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,033
Think about it. The two of them just rode the bus together once, that's all.

668
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:05,167
I mean, bluntly speaking, did the kids date?

669
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:06,267
Or did they get married or something?

670
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,767
Why? Why on earth are you all acting like this?

671
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,933
The point is to stop it before it gets to that point, right?

672
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,700
Quit the chatter and send Kang Hee to Seoul.

673
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,667
Or else, well…

674
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:19,500
Or marry Su Ji off somewhere.

675
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,800
You, really…

676
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
Hey, you're back?

677
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:41,367
- You said you had something to say 
 - Hm?

678
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:44,067
Ah, good.

679
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:47,833
Every time I think of you,

680
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,833
this is where I come.

681
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:55,467
Look, there… look at that.

682
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,667
The migratory birds flying away.

683
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:02,467
Sometimes I see them and think of you, that's why.

684
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:05,167
- You're saying I am like those birds? 
 - That's how it was.

685
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:08,667
Those little guys fly all the way here from Russia.

686
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:12,833
Covering thousands of miles, flapping their wings.

687
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,433
Trying to survive.

688
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:17,833
So, when you left.

689
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,733
I just thought, "It's the law of nature."

690
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:24,167
That's how I found solace, you know.

691
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:30,233
Chun Pil, you've really thought of everything to ease your mind.

692
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:34,167
But then, when the time comes,

693
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:39,200
these little guys come back again, to their homeland.

694
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:45,700
But I'm not coming back.

695
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,067
Oh, well. Who is this person in front of me?

696
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:51,967
You know, I just came to work for a while.

697
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:53,933
Got it.

698
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,467
Even if you leave after a while,

699
00:49:56,467 --> 00:50:01,367
I just want you to be comfortable, that's all.

700
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:04,400
You don't have to worry about what people say.

701
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,933
You don't have to think that you're going to be kicked out.

702
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:12,500
Just… go when it's convenient for you.

703
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,367
Of course.

704
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:18,733
I came here to work, and won't return until the work is finished.

705
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:22,167
Okay, then that's fine.

706
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:27,567
Ah, also, I need to go somewhere for a bit.

707
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,100
So you need to behave and take care of yourself in the meantime.

708
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,000
Where are you going?

709
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,100
Traveling!

710
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,967
Excitingly!

711
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:42,433
You've got good fortune.

712
00:50:42,433 --> 00:50:45,400
My name is Chun Pil, isn't it?

713
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,133
My life is always like a spring day!

714
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:53,067
That's just your own thought.

715
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:55,367
Where can you find such a gloomy spring?

716
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:58,100
Yahoo!

717
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,633
Yahoo!

718
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:08,500
   

719
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:13,367
Are you done with work already?

720
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:16,633
Oh, my! You've finally arrived.

721
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:18,767
But, where did everyone go?

722
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:21,267
We received a suspension order.

723
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:23,733
What? Why?

724
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:26,267
Well, something about the noise, the dust,

725
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:29,300
the fence has crossed onto the road, this and that.

726
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,367
What? Why now?

727
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,167
Where is the manager?

728
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,267
It seems this is all because of her.

729
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:43,567
It's so quiet without the construction.

730
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,333
- Are you the one who did it? 
 - Was it only me?

731
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,300
This kid has talent in this area.

732
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,633
They lodged numerous complaints in great detail.

733
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:54,233
Hey, even if you build a building, you couldn't file that many claims.

734
00:51:54,233 --> 00:51:58,633
But if the construction gets prolonged, doesn't it mean Ji Kang Hee stays longer?

735
00:51:58,633 --> 00:51:59,900
Hey. Jeez!

736
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,867
Will the locals just stay quiet?

737
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:04,533
Right now, they're keeping quiet because of Mr. Chun Pil.

738
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:06,467
Do you think Ms. Su Ji will stay quiet?

739
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:09,733
- She's in the hospital even now, they say… 
 - Welcome.

740
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:20,000
- Still? 
 - It's the two-timer.

741
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:25,600
The work has been suspended, but why didn't you report it?

742
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,867
I reported it to the CEO.

743
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:31,000
You bypassed me?

744
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,467
Why?

745
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:33,867
I want to go up to Seoul.

746
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,567
What kind of nonsense is that…

747
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:37,867
A beautiful finish, don't you know? A beautiful finish.

748
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:39,800
If you start something, you should see it through.

749
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,300
Complaints will keep coming in.

750
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,433
When I am here…

751
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:46,533
No, it's not like you are making a racket at the construction site,

752
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:50,200
nor are you stirring up dust with a fan. So, why exactly?

753
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,167
You there! Do you have something to say to us?

754
00:52:57,267 --> 00:53:01,200
Seems like you've finished talking. I'll be going now.

755
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,100
Okay.

756
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,100
What should I know?

757
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:35,467
Hello!

758
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:37,100
I…

759
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:41,033
Did you hear I was admitted to the hospital?

760
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,733
- No. 
 - I feel like I might die because of you.

761
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:51,567
Let's talk openly and honestly.

762
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:55,667
You're all grown up now, so I believe you'll understand.

763
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,633
It's unfortunate for you, right?

764
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:07,400
Being the daughter of such a woman.

765
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:15,567
What can you do about the blood that runs in your veins?

766
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:16,833
I will listen no more.

767
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:21,033
You… You're the spitting image of your mother.

768
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,667
Leaving behind a good husband like Chun Pil,

769
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:28,433
your mother seduced my husband and eloped.

770
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:29,867
It's exactly the same.

771
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,500
Leaving a man from Seoul who's an heir to a hotel,

772
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,600
why do you keep hanging around Yeon Soo, calling him a friend and such?

773
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,567
And when are you planning to show your true colors?

774
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,767
Shall I reveal them now?

775
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:48,033
- What? 
 - Since my mom took your husband,

776
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:51,667
I guess it's okay for me to take your son.

777
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:55,567
Look… Look there!

778
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:58,200
I knew it would be like that.

779
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,000
Even if I die, I won't let him be taken from me.

780
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:07,700
Our Yeon Soo, I will never give him up.

781
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:14,400
- Mom. 
 - Yeon Soo.

782
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,933
Make things clear here.

783
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:19,367
Is it me or Kang Hee?

784
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:21,633
Me or Kang Hee?

785
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:22,967
Mom.

786
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:26,467
Why did you leave the hospital? You're not well.

787
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:28,333
Mom, it makes me sad when you do that.

788
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:30,533
No, showing your true colors just like that…

789
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:33,900
- What if you get sick? 
 - She's revealing her true self.

790
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,000
- Mom. 
 - Right.

791
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,367
I…

792
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:41,067
I've become the man you dislike.

793
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,533
A man who knows your past.

794
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:51,200
How much did you hear?

795
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,567
Let's do this fairly.

796
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:57,667
I'll tell you about my dark past even Esther doesn't know.

797
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,100
There's no need to make things up.

798
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:06,500
I ran away saying I didn't want to marry her, and rumors spread...

799
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,767
that I liked men.

800
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,500
Esther came to find me.

801
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,100
She cried, saying she understood and it didn't matter.

802
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,200
This is as far as Esther knows the story.

803
00:57:22,867 --> 00:57:25,167
There was a woman I met at that time.

804
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:28,100
A woman whose hobby was collecting men.

805
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:34,133
Esther thought I got hurt because I was infatuated with that woman.

806
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:39,500
I just needed a rumor to spread because of that woman.

807
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,233
What kind of rumor?

808
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:44,600
About my sexual preferences?

809
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,000
Might as well hate me a lot since you dislike me, is that it? Right now?

810
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,933
I'm just saying you might also need a rumor.

811
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,267
I'll cover up the nonsense that troubles you with my own rumors.

812
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,533
I'm still your official boyfriend.

813
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:37,500
 But, Yeon Soo, 

814
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,167
 we can't change our parents, 

815
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,500
 neither you nor me. 

816
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:01,633
 Yeon Soo! 

817
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:05,733
 Yeon Soo! 

818
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,700
 Try to open your eyes! 

819
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,767
 Kang Hee, open your eyes! 

820
00:59:48,467 --> 00:59:50,910
Feels good, right?

821
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,167
I've always wanted to come here just once.

822
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:10,667
How did you know what I wanted?

823
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:14,467
Hey, it's so nice.

824
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:20,367
Over there, that used to be all fields in the old days.

825
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,967
That's right.

826
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,067
It was here.

827
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:34,333
 - Is it warm now? 
 - Yes. 

828
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:13,367
 Oh, the kids. 

829
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,467
 They have fallen asleep. 

830
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:17,500
 They must have been tired. 

831
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,767
 I'm okay. 

832
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:25,267
You've never seen my father smile, have you?

833
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:28,300
When I was a kid,

834
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,067
I used to wish that Kang Hee's mother was my mother.

835
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,667
I told you many lies.

836
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,967
I'm sorry.

837
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,700
 Let's go in, Yeon Soo. 

838
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,333
 Where have you been to be this late? 

839
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,133
 Clinic visit. 

840
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,300
 You went, too? 

841
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:02,767
You were in this together?

842
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:07,133
Yeon Soo, you too?

843
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,800
I had no choice.

844
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:15,067
Back then, it was true I preferred the other woman over you.

845
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:23,400
That's why I've been living dragged around by you out of guilt.

846
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:27,700
Because of you, I also sent away Kang Hee.

847
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:32,700
I accepted those strange men you brought as stepfathers.

848
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,933
Even when I had to give them alimony and settlement money,

849
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:41,667
I never complained, not even once.

850
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,067
Because I thought it was the punishment I deserved.

851
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:53,133
The punishment...

852
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,467
for nor loving my own mother truthfully.

853
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:08,133
But now, I think I have paid it off.

854
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:12,733
I'm planning to be independent of you, Mom.

855
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:16,333
Is all of this because of Kang Hee?

856
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,400
Kang Hee is absolutely off-limits.

857
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,367
You heard it, too!

858
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,933
That she intends to take you away like what her mother did to your dad.

859
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,867
As for Kang Hee,

860
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:30,533
she gets angry when sad, and runs away when wronged.

861
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:37,133
The fact that Kang Hee speaks harshly, even when she doesn't feel it,

862
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,300
means that she feels very wronged and sad, Mom.

863
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:47,467
All this time, Kang Hee and I...

864
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:51,867
seemed to have endured behind the wall of "friendship".

865
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:55,900
But I can't stand it any longer.

866
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,433
I am no longer going...

867
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,367
to be friends with her.

868
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:26,167
I have something to say.

869
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:28,733
Me too.

870
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:36,420
♫  What if I was wrong  ♫

871
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:43,130
♫  apart from my everything. Don't force me to hurt  ♫

872
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:49,750
♫  because of my feelings for you. Forgive me, my dear  ♫

873
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,830
♫  for running into you  ♫

874
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,350
♫  for awhile  ♫

875
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:04,240
♫  You told me about your everything. Your whispers are all my favorite thing  ♫

876
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,020
♫  I think I fell in love with you  ♫

877
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,780
♫  But how can I forget you  ♫

878
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:15,060
♫  You stayed close in the everyday  ♫

879
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,170
♫  You made me realize and find my dream ♫

880
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:22,367
Go out with me.

881
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:35,940


882
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:45,520
♫  What if I was wrong apart from my everything ♫

883
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,690
♫  Don't force me to hurt  ♫

884
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:55,810
♫  Because of my feelings for you 
 forgive me, my dear  ♫

885
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,830
 From now on, you're all I see and think about. 

886
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,140
 Starting today, we're dating. 

887
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,430
 I'm back! 

888
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:02,470
 Did something good happen? 

889
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:06,520
 Did you two...  

890
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,880
  - It's about Kang Hee... 
 - Kang Hee did this? 

891
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,050
 Are you happy for turning us into fools? 

892
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,790
 If you hurt her, I won't let you go easily. 

893
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,930
 Our Kang Hee was proposed to by the son of a hotel owner 

894
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:21,630
 Why would she date Yeon Soo? 

895
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:25,230
 Kang Hee! 

896
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,600
 I'm so jealous! 

897
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,730
 Will you marry me?
