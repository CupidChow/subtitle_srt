1
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,033
Why do you keep doing this to me?

2
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,667
Cheon Yeon Soo.

3
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,433
Why did you help me?

4
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,800
Who are you to help me?

5
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,467
Answer me.

6
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,000
Do you like me?

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,533
That's all I can do for you.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
Because I can't wipe away your tears,

9
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,133
I can't hold you back
as a discarded first love.

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,233
That's all I can do for you one last time,
because that's all there is.

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,433
Can't I even do that?

12
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,000
You don't like it?

13
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,067
One last time?

14
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,733
Who says it's the last time?

15
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,433
Why are you changing the ending as you please?

16
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,033
I know that the beginning and
the end should always be yours.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,300
But I need some time.

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,900
Time? What time?

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,500
Time to forget you.

20
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,600
So don't worry.

21
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,033
Don't feel pressured, and don't get angry.

22
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,633
Just give me some time.

23
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:12,467
<i>I hate that, that's why I hate it.</i>

24
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:16,367
<i>Because you know all about my
dark past and my wounds. That's why…</i>

25
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,700
<i>It hurts to see you.</i>

26
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,833
Couldn't find her?

27
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,100
It's over.

28
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,133
It was over from the start.

29
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,067
That's actually better.

30
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:08,933
<i>Kang Hee, where are you?</i>

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>Please come to the police station now.</i>

32
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
The man who claims to be
Yeon Soo's mother's husband

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,533
is causing a scene and threatening
to sue your father, so I…

34
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,400
Hello?

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
<i>Kang Hee.</i>

36
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,833
- Cheers.
- Let's have a drink.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,067
Hey, Ah Reum, please just
bring me a bottle of beer here.

38
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,633
Hey, Ah Reum, bring some soju too.

39
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,333
Kang Hee.

40
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,800
- Oh? Hey.
- Come quick.

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,233
Everyone is gathered here now.

42
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,300
Hey.

43
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,600
I don't want to be joined.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Seok Kyeong was here too, hurry up.

45
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,367
Hey, hey.

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,733
You came here looking
for your boyfriend, right?

47
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,000
He was here just now, but he just left.

48
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,967
Ji Kang Hee, I'll enjoy the meal, thanks.

49
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,533
Seok Kyeong gave us his credit card.

50
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,467
Originally it was just Seok Kyeong
and us, but then the others came…

51
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,033
What's the most expensive thing here?

52
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,867
Order all the side dishes on the menu,
from start to finish, all of them.

53
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,600
Yeah, you said we can use the credit
card as much as we want.

54
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,067
Ji Kang Hee, it's okay, isn't it?

55
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,567
Why are you asking me that?

56
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:18,833
Please give me a glass here.

57
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,933
Thank you.

58
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,867
Han Ah Reum, you've been on blind dates, right?

59
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,700
With the ophthalmologist.

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,600
Last time, you went on
a blind date with a dentist.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
And this time, with an ophthalmologist?

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,333
It seems like you only go
on blind dates with doctors.

63
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,400
That's only good if it works out well.

64
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,033
Does that mean all the blind
dates didn't go well?

65
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,967
Ah Reum's family has a lot of money, right?

66
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,900
How could a public education
employee have a lot of money?

67
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,800
You say you don't have money,
but you got a master's and PhD…

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
Honestly, what's the point of a degree
if you're just lending books?

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,933
She would need it when
going on blind dates, I guess.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,133
- What?
- What?

71
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:51,567
Yeah, give it a try.

72
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,600
Who knows?

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,333
Maybe you'll snag a Prince
Charming like Kang Hee.

74
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:56,967
Hey.

75
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,567
Hey?

76
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,033
Han Ah Reum can get angry too?

77
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,867
Is it because Ji Kang Hee is next to you,
so there's nothing to be afraid of?

78
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,300
Stop messing around.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go, Han Ah Reum.

80
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,333
Let's go.

81
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,933
Why are you listening to this crap?

82
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,733
Come on, let's just go.

83
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,333
- Ignorant punks.
- What? Ignorant?

84
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,733
How dare you? You only have
a middle school education!

85
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,600
Don't you know whose fault is it that
he only has a middle school education?

86
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,500
Seriously, you've killed my mood to drink.

87
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,133
Ji Kang Hee, what are we
supposed to do if you leave too?

88
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,464
Who's paying the bills here?

89
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,733
<i>[Motel California]</i>
At last…

90
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,033
I've achieved my dream.

91
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,333
Thanks to Chun Pil.

92
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,700
What was your dream?

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,400
A divorce that doesn't cost money.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,100
I think a wedding that costs
a lot of money is romantic,

95
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,933
and a divorce that doesn't
cost much is preferable.

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,833
Su Ji, I have a favor to ask of you.

97
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:14,700
Next time you get married,
never register the marriage.

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,400
I think I'll become a divorce
lawyer because of you.

99
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:21,667
I guess he'd start building up some expertise.

100
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,100
It's already your fourth time, after all.

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,300
That's right.

102
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,400
Hey.

103
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,633
Don't ever think about getting a divorce

104
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:33,633
just because I'm like this, okay?

105
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,433
These two get along well.
How could that be possible?

106
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,667
No way.

107
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,100
You can just live by getting
a divorce first, like she did.

108
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,433
Oh, senior.

109
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,300
No, Kang Hee.

110
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,600
Kang Hee.

111
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,800
Let's just go.

112
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,967
I can go alone.

113
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
You don't have to take me there.

114
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,833
Goodbye.

115
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,567
Be careful.

116
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,167
See, I told you to just come out
quickly, but you didn't listen to me.

117
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,867
Everyone thinks we're getting
married, how could I do that?

118
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,733
It's because you've
unnecessarily spread rumors.

119
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,267
I told you to stop it earlier.

120
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,467
Should we stop, then?

121
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah, let's stop.

122
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:31,667
Okay.

123
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,000
Then, let's go.

124
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,000
Where to?

125
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,800
To Kang Hee.

126
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,200
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,567
The person you've been waiting for

128
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,567
is Kang Hee, right?

129
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,100
'I've waited for you with my whole heart,
without looking at anyone else.'

130
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,667
'I have no intention of meeting anyone
else but you for the rest of my life.'

131
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,400
Go to her and tell her honestly.

132
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,167
Go and tell her right now!

133
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,367
Be careful.

134
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,733
If you say that to Kang Hee,

135
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,633
then I will also clarify the rumor.

136
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,233
Okay?

137
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,567
Yeah, I told him we should break up.

138
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,167
It was my fault.

139
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,133
Even so…

140
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:50,233
After 20 years, he couldn't even wait
a few months and fell for someone else?

141
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:54,133
Yeah, to the person who's liked me for
over 20 years, I have nothing to say.

142
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,867
Even so…

143
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,333
He should have held out a little longer.

144
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm also in Seoul now, with a proper job

145
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,967
and my own room all set up,

146
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,233
so if he comes to Seoul, I'm fine with it.

147
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,500
Has he completely fallen for
Yoon Nan Woo that much?

148
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, he must be happy.

149
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,667
She was indeed pretty.

150
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,800
And her smile was pretty too.

151
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,067
Even the voice was lovely.

152
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,333
Everything was pretty.

153
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,600
Is she on the phone?

154
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,733
Even so…

155
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,767
He said he only liked me before.

156
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,600
He's a total liar.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,400
What? He's going to forget about me now?

158
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,567
Jeez.

159
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,767
Is there nothing more he can do?

160
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,267
Yes, I have nothing to say.

161
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,900
Does he like her a lot?

162
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,933
Why is she talking on the phone all night?

163
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,833
He must be happy because
his girlfriend is pretty.

164
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:06,533
He must be happy because
her voice is beautiful.

165
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,700
Ugh, bad guy.

166
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,400
Bad guy.

167
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,267
Did Ji Kang Hee come to torture me?

168
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,967
She said he wasn't her boyfriend.

169
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,167
<i>He's not my boyfriend, but my husband.</i>

170
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,167
<i>No.</i>

171
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,867
<i>He's not my husband, but on my side.</i>

172
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,033
<i>What about me?</i>

173
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,633
<i>I'm on your side too, Kang Hee.</i>

174
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,533
<i>No, you are not.</i>

175
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,933
<i>Cheon Yeon Soo,</i>

176
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,700
<i>you're on your mom's side,</i>

177
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,033
<i>your grandfather's side,</i>

00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,367
<i>Mr. Chun Pil's side,</i>

179
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,033
<i>Hana-eup's side,</i>

180
00:12:57,033 --> 00:13:01,667
<i>the side of cows, chickens, pigs, animals,</i>

181
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,233
<i>and Yoon Nan Woo's side.</i>

182
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,500
<i>No, I'm not in a relationship with
Yoon Nan Woo to get married.</i>

183
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,200
<i>You need to be scolded.</i>

184
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,167
<i>I'll handle him.</i>

185
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,067
<i>Dare to avoid me?</i>

186
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,633
<i>You started it first.</i>

187
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,667
<i>You dare hit me here?</i>

188
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

189
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,100
<i>Did you just bite me? Come here.</i>

190
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,033
<i>Let go, let go!</i>

191
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,433
<i>Let go! I said let go!</i>

192
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
<i>[Motel California]</i>

193
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,067
Good.

194
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,367
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

195
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,033
Did you take Ah Reum home safely?

196
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,067
Yes.

197
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,333
By the way, why did you do that yesterday?

198
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,367
What?

199
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
What about that?

200
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,467
Hey, is that what a friend does, just
staying silent in that situation?

201
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,533
You by any chance…

202
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,100
Don't say it.

203
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,033
How dare I think that,
considering my situation?

204
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,067
What's wrong with your situation?

205
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,067
I'm an orphan and only have
a middle school education.

206
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,867
Jeez.

207
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,633
Please don't do this anymore.

208
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,967
The people at the bar that day, they're
the ones who bullied you as a kid, right?

209
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,133
'Kang Hee is doing great in Seoul.'

210
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,933
'I'm falling for her and chasing after her.'

211
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,967
'Well, if Kang Hee likes
me, I'll even get married.'

212
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,467
When I said that, they were
totally suffering from jealousy.

213
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,000
This is what you call revenge.

214
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,433
True revenge.

215
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,533
Why are you taking my revenge?

216
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:26,367
I'm your official boyfriend until
the construction is done. Remember?

217
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,967
<i>I'll use you one more time,</i>

218
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,567
<i>just until the construction is done.</i>

219
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,433
<i>This time, I have a condition too.</i>

220
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:39,833
<i>If you're using me, I have to be your official
boyfriend until the construction is done.</i>

221
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,133
<i>Do you really have to?</i>

222
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,133
<i>I don't want that.</i>

223
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,133
<i>Then go and clarify things to them.</i>

224
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,100
I need to have at least
some safety measures, too.

225
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,333
If we break up before
the construction is finished,

226
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,333
then I'll be the bad guy, and you'll be
the tragic heroine who got dumped.

227
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,400
No, that's not it.

228
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,067
I'll be the one who gets criticized
in this neighborhood, no matter what.

229
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:00,333
So, you don't need to worry about that.

230
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,800
Oh, that's even more upsetting.

231
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,900
I can't stand it when people criticize you.

232
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,967
Alright, then.

233
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,567
It doesn't matter to me.

234
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,433
So we have a deal, okay?

235
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm your official boyfriend.

236
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,267
Alright, official boyfriend.

237
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,600
As your official boyfriend, I'm
asking, what should we do today?

238
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,933
We don't have anything to do
during the curing process, right?

239
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,033
I have a lot of work to do.

240
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,867
Where are you going?

241
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Oh, Mr. Kwon again.

242
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,200
Why do you keep blocking me only?

243
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:55,200
<i>Kang Hee, you're like my granddaughter.</i>

244
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,733
<i>Always smile brightly.</i>

245
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,500
<i>Kang Hee, congratulations on
becoming a high school student.</i>

246
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,367
<i>Go buy a satchel.</i>

247
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,700
<i>Congratulations on your graduation.</i>

248
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,667
<i>Even when you go to high school, like now.</i>

249
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:17,500
<i>Don't lose the cool Ji Kang Hee.</i>

250
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:51,833
Hello.

251
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,633
Oh? Hello.

252
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,567
The director is not here right now.

253
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,533
I came today because I have
something I want to ask you.

254
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,867
You can speak casually.

255
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,133
I could ask Yeon Soo, but
since it's a personal question,

256
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,167
I wanted to ask you directly.

257
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,333
I really hope you can answer me.

258
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,367
What is it?

259
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,833
Your parents…

260
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,033
Mr. Cheon.

261
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,633
Please ask him directly.

262
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:31,767
It doesn't seem like something I should say.

263
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,300
Please hear it directly from him.

264
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,000
What's going on?

265
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,300
Ms. Yoon, are both of her parents still around?

266
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Yes.

267
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:01,733
She must have grown up with a lot of love.

268
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,967
I guess so.

269
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,233
But why?

270
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,900
I came to ask about that.

271
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,733
I mean, whether both of
her parents are still around,

272
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,733
and if she grew up with a lot of love.

273
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,333
Can you spare some time today?

274
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,433
I want to go visit Grandpa.

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,300
I really want you to come with me.

276
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,900
Grandpa.

277
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,300
You know I'm really good at holding on, right?

278
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,600
I held on even when taking
care of you was tough.

279
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,300
And when Mom caused trouble, and it
was too much to handle, I held on well.

280
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Even when I got kicked
by a cow and broke my ribs,

281
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,633
I held on well, laughing it off.

282
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,300
But why can't I hold on
when it comes to Kang Hee?

283
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,333
I know.

284
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,233
I know that there is someone
else beside Kang Hee.

285
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,467
But Kang Hee's back keeps
telling a different story.

286
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,633
She keeps saying that she's struggling

287
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,033
and suffering.

288
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,833
So, I'm just going to tell her

289
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,167
that I'll wait, and she can come
back anytime if she's struggling.

290
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,433
You'll support me, right?

291
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,200
Grandpa, you've always been
on mine and Kang Hee's side.

292
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,867
Grandpa.

293
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,900
I'm here.

294
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,900
You're watching us, right?

295
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:13,033
I came to keep my promise.

296
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
Isn't this Grandpa's ring?

297
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,500
Why do you have this?

298
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,900
I once went to see Grandpa

299
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,467
because I wanted to go to Seoul with you.

300
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,367
<i>- Grandpa?
- Yes?</i>

301
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:57,400
<i>Grandpa, can't you persuade Yeon Soo?</i>

302
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,167
<i>About what?</i>

303
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,667
<i>We agreed to go to Seoul together.</i>

304
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,733
<i>Let's go to Seoul where no one knows us</i>

305
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:07,033
<i>and enjoy a free campus life together.</i>

306
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,533
<i>But suddenly, Yeon Soo says he won't go.</i>

307
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,100
<i>Kang Hee.</i>

308
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,167
<i>My health has gotten a bit worse.</i>

309
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,867
<i>How serious is it?</i>

310
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,933
<i>Are you seriously unwell?</i>

311
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,067
<i>Does Yeon Soo know?</i>

312
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,833
<i>That's why Yeon Soo…</i>

313
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:37,767
<i>Then he should've told me.</i>

314
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,300
<i>How serious is it?</i>

315
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,267
<i>Kang Hee.</i>

316
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,567
<i>Would you do me a favor?</i>

317
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:59,033
<i>Open it.</i>

318
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,167
<i>It's pretty, isn't it?</i>

319
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,367
<i>This is the ring I gave to Yeon Soo's
grandmother as a present.</i>

320
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:21,300
<i>After Yeon Soo's grandmother passed away,
Yeon Soo asked for that ring so desperately,</i>

321
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,600
<i>but I didn't give it to him.</i>

322
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:28,000
<i>I wanted to give it to Yeon Soo's
partner, a granddaughter-in-law.</i>

323
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:34,500
<i>I don't know how long I have left to live,</i>

324
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,167
<i>and I can't guarantee I'll be able to give
this to you while I'm still in my right mind.</i>

325
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,467
<i>So, Kang Hee,</i>

326
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:48,867
<i>when Yeon Soo meets the right one,</i>

327
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,867
<i>will you give it on to him?</i>

328
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,100
<i>I hope Yeon Soo's partner
is a cheerful and kind child,</i>

329
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,233
<i>loved by both parents in an ordinary family.</i>

330
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,900
<i>You'll do me a favor, right?</i>

331
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,867
That's nonsense.

332
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:24,700
The motel construction was just an excuse.

333
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,667
I heard you might get married,
so I came to check.

334
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,567
Grandfather was right.

335
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,267
For you, Cheon Yeon Soo,

336
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,467
it won't be someone like me, who's pugnacious,

337
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,767
but someone lovely like Yoon Nan Woo.

338
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,500
What does that mean?

339
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,967
I'm glad you met a good person,

340
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,967
and now I can keep my promise

341
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,733
with Grandpa.

342
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,133
No, Kang Hee, that's not it.

343
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:58,533
I hope you live happily for generations
in this countryside, Hana-eup,

344
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:00,700
Cheon Yeon Soo.

345
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,633
It's all over now.

346
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,200
It's really over.

347
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,433
<i>If I keep enduring here,</i>

348
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,533
<i>like that motel, my life will also go dark.</i>

349
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,033
<i>You're doing just fine.</i>

350
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,067
<i>But I can't endure it.</i>

351
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,100
<i>I'll never come back here again.</i>

352
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,200
<i>Isn't it amazing?</i>

353
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,533
<i>We've received a celebration from the people.</i>

354
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:26,067
<i>The elders in Hana-eup gave blessings.</i>

355
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,100
<i>But to us,</i>

356
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,533
<i>they acted so cruelly and harshly,</i>

357
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,667
<i>pretending to care and look out for us.</i>

358
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,267
<i>Why do you remember such things?</i>

359
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:41,267
<i>You should erase those memories</i>

360
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,900
<i>and live on, forgetting them.</i>

361
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,033
<i>I know, right?</i>

362
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,167
<i>I should have done that.</i>

363
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,967
<i>I intend to do so now.</i>

364
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,667
<i>I won't have to listen to
this kind of crap anymore.</i>

365
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,533
I'm sorry.

366
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,467
You must have had it harder than anyone.

367
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:00,967
I was too ignorant.

368
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,667
I'm sorry, Kang Hee.

369
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,467
So that's why you asked

370
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,867
if Ms. Yoon has both parents
and if she grew up being loved.

371
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,733
Those words

372
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,667
were really painful to me.

373
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:50,733
I could never be that kind of person.

374
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:53,267
No matter how hard I try,

375
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,600
I can never become that kind of person.

376
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,767
Then, did you just push me
away because of Grandpa?

377
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,733
It's not the whole reason,
but that was part of it.

378
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,467
Hey.

379
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,933
Hey, Kang Hee, Ji Kang Hee!

380
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,167
Hey, what are you doing?

381
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:32,467
Hey.

382
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,867
Just come out, it's dangerous.

383
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,133
Wait, I need to find this.

384
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:42,533
Why are you looking for it? What
are you planning to do with it?

385
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,633
I should find it and give it to her.

386
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:48,067
To me, it's like Grandpa's last will.

387
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,733
Who are you going to give it to?

388
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:55,900
That's not it.

389
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,467
What?

390
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,133
I'm not marrying Yoon Nan Woo.

391
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,967
Kang Hee, are you okay?

392
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:18,800
Kang Hee.

393
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,667
Hey.

394
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,500
Never mind, you're cold too.

395
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,133
It's okay.

396
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,267
You'll catch a cold.

397
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:50,367
It's fine.

398
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,567
It's your coat.

399
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,733
You can have it.

400
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,867
Aren't you going to marry Yoon Nan Woo?

401
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,233
How come?

402
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,433
Why not?

403
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,067
You know what Hana-eup is like.

404
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:15,467
Yeon Soo is setting up
a clinic with Yoon Nan Woo.

405
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,233
What? Really?

406
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:21,400
So that's why he said he was going to get a job
in Seoul, but ended up staying in Hana-eup?

407
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
That's crazy.

408
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,133
He made a good decision.

409
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,233
Yoon Nan Woo is much better than Ji Kang Hee.

410
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,467
She's young and cute.

411
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,933
Oh dear.

412
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,600
I was envious.

413
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,867
I thought we were going
to marry Han Woo off first.

414
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,633
So when are they getting married?

415
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,400
I don't know.

416
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,067
A vet couple?

417
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:43,533
Oh my, that's nice.

418
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
Well…

419
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,533
I mean, as long as Yeon Soo
is happy, I have no objections.

420
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,300
It means

421
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,100
I'm the one with an open mind.

422
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,633
You haven't changed one bit,

423
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,933
now or then.

424
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:03,867
What about you?

425
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,300
I mean, that man.

426
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,667
Didn't I tell you?

427
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:15,600
When I go to Seoul, I'm
going to meet a lot of men.

428
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,333
And among them, I'll
marry the most fantastic man.

429
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
What kind of man is a 'fantastic man'?

430
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,833
A man who's nothing like Chun Pil.

431
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,533
So, is he that kind of man?

432
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,533
He's from a different world than me.

433
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,133
He's probably never once thought
that someone might dislike him.

434
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:42,533
He has probably never felt inferior.

435
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,233
He's truly someone

436
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,700
with no twisted or negative
traits in his personality.

437
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,867
So sometimes,

438
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,033
I feel envious when I look at him.

439
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,633
So, you said it's good.

440
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,433
Hey, wait a minute.

441
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,433
Why do you guys look like that?

442
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:12,733
Where have you been?

443
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,900
What are you talking
about? We just met up front.

444
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,633
Doesn't seem like you've just met, huh?

445
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:21,833
Where did you guys go?

446
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,867
Just leave them alone.

447
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:24,600
Yeon Soo is off-limits to you.

448
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,700
Just leave them alone.

449
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,967
- What?
- Hobbies?

450
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,067
- That won't do.
- Why?

451
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:34,000
You know how hard it was for him, right?

452
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,800
I've decided to stop pretending
to be engaged to Ms. Yoon.

453
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,900
We decided to clarify the rumors.

454
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,400
So what?

455
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,167
What does that have to do with me?

456
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,600
That's just how it is.

457
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,633
Oh, it's hot.

458
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,933
Oh my, it's cold.

459
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh, it's warm.

460
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,333
Huh? Ms. Hwang.

461
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,700
Oh, Kang Hee.

462
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,100
What brings you here?

463
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,433
I didn't come for any special reason.

464
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,933
Am I not allowed here?

465
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,500
The carpentry work hasn't even
started, but the vibe is already here.

466
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
Now that I've seen it, I'm even more excited.

467
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,533
Why are you wearing heels?

468
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,733
Do you want to use the wheelchair again?

469
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,300
I bought it to commemorate not
having to use a wheelchair anymore.

470
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:37,233
I'm meeting someone today.

471
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,300
- Today?
- Who?

472
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,533
Kang Hee, what do you think about the client?

473
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,033
He's gentle and nice, right?

474
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:44,167
Well…

475
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,600
Of course, he's the best.

476
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,167
Right?

477
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:51,367
The truth is, I've known him for a long time,

478
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
and I'm considering seeing
him seriously this time.

479
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,733
- What?
- After surviving a near-death experience,

480
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:59,933
I realized it would be nice to have
someone by my side who is on my side.

481
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,000
He's older than he looks.

482
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,867
I'm older than I look, too.

483
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:08,300
Do you know he's a widower with a child?

484
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,400
So what?

485
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,633
He's a dad who raised his daughter with
devotion after getting hurt at a young age.

486
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,800
He really loved his daughter.

487
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,500
He said his daughter lost
her favorite teddy bear.

488
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,000
So he wanted to give her a teddy
bear as a birthday present.

489
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,567
I bought him one, the original Teddy Bear.

490
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,433
You're saying that you bought that for her?

491
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:28,467
Yes.

492
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:33,800
She must be in college by now.

493
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,667
Would she like me?

494
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,400
Do you know how he became a widower?

495
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,167
- Huh?
- Please ask about it.

496
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,100
They say the man's greatest
accomplishment in life is womanizing.

497
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:59,467
Is the client's reputation that bad?

498
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:01,900
Do you know the client's name?

499
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
Of course.

500
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,067
Ji Chun Pil.

501
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:08,133
How can his name be so classic and romantic?

502
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,200
Ji Chun Pil, Ji Kang Hee.

503
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,300
Doesn't it remind you of anything?

504
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:15,867
They have the same last name.

505
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,233
Kang Hee said she grew up in a motel, right?

506
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,867
- No way…
- Yes.

507
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,333
The only daughter of the client Ji Chun Pil

508
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,933
is Ji Kang Hee.

509
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,800
It's ridiculous.

510
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,733
Are you, by any chance…

511
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,567
Kkam Hee?

512
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,567
Why are you here?

513
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,600
What are you looking at?

514
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,933
Hey.

515
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,967
I heard about the secret of your birth today.

516
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:50,967
I really don't like your origin, seriously.

517
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,200
What are you doing?

518
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:00,733
Are you taking it?

519
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,267
I'm going to throw it away.

520
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,400
Why are you throwing away my teddy bear?

521
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,867
No, it's not.

522
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:07,533
This was bought by Mr. Chun Pil
to impress a certain lady.

523
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,467
He did? For whom?

524
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:12,100
What are you talking about all of sudden?

525
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,267
Ms. Hwang.

526
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
Huh?

527
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,633
Unbelievable.

528
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:19,733
You.

529
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:24,200
You know when I started
calling Dad 'Mr. Chun Pil'?

530
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
<i>Director.</i>

531
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,600
<i>- Ah, you're here…
- I'm a bit late.</i>

532
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,933
<i>Where have you been?</i>

533
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,100
<i>My brother died because of you.</i>

534
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,000
<i>Mom almost died, too.</i>

535
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,300
<i>Yes, that's…</i>

536
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,600
<i>Kang Hee, I'm sorry.</i>

537
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
<i>I'm late. I'm sorry.</i>

538
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,500
<i>Go, you have no right to be here.</i>

539
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,600
<i>Leave, from now on, you are not even my dad.</i>

540
00:40:58,867 --> 00:41:01,167
<i>Kang Hee, I'm sorry, so sorry.</i>

541
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:05,333
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

542
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,100
<i>Oh dear, I did wrong, I'm sorry.</i>

543
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,633
<i>I will do better. I'm sorry.</i>

544
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,633
Even now, when I think about that day,

545
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:24,067
I wake up suddenly in anger and get mad.

546
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,967
Back then, Mr. Chun Pil acted like
a caring husband, like a kind father,

547
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,900
and was going around lying to women.

548
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,833
He must have had a hard time
with what happened that day, too.

549
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:37,967
Don't take his side.

550
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,800
Both Mr. Chun Pil and your mom…

551
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,467
My mom?

552
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,967
At the moment my brother died,

553
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,567
Chun Pil and Su Ji were together.

554
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,033
<i>Mom.</i>

555
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,933
<i>Mom, mom, what's happening?</i>

556
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:08,733
<i>Kang Hee, please call Dad for me.</i>

557
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,933
<i>Please call Dad.</i>

558
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:13,033
<i>Please call Dad…</i>

559
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,600
<i>Mom.</i>

560
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,833
<i>Mom.</i>

561
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,900
<i>Mom.</i>

562
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
<i>Mom.</i>

563
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,800
When Mom and

564
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,533
my little brother were dying,

565
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,833
Mr. Chun Pil was with your mom.

566
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:40,133
He went to Seoul to catch
a conman who tricked your mom.

567
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,467
I will

568
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:47,000
never forgive Mr. Chun Pil

569
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,567
and your mom.

570
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,633
What about me?

571
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,167
You…

572
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,733
Can you abandon your mom?

573
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,800
Oh, is that your room?

574
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,433
Oh, Ms. Hwang.

575
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:46,100
I'd like to take a look at your
room, see if the dolls are okay.

576
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, no…

577
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,900
The room hasn't been cleaned.

578
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,233
You were here.

579
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:56,633
I have prepared a cup
of warm tea before you go.

580
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:58,233
Let's have a drink downstairs.

581
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:00,033
- Oh, shall we?
- Yes, yes.

582
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:03,600
Kang Hee, I will be going then, take care.

583
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,900
Ah, just a moment.

584
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:07,633
I will escort you, Ms. Hwang.

585
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:08,800
Will you?

586
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,100
No, it's okay, I can go alone.

587
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,567
You can't. It's too much to drive alone.

588
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,667
I came alone?

589
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,400
That's what I mean. Round-trip
driving is really too much.

590
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,233
If you're really worried, ask Manager Keum.

591
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:20,433
You should stay and watch over the site.

592
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,633
No, I will escort you.

593
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,967
I want to go to Seoul.

594
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:30,867
It will take a lot of time for the concrete
to cure, and I have nothing to do.

595
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,733
I need to go. I want to go home.

596
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,833
It's hard living in a motel for a long time.

597
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:39,300
I want to rest in my own room.

598
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:48,300
Then shall we go to the lobby and wait?

599
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,567
- Shall we?
- Yes.

600
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:50,633
Then I'll wait downstairs.

601
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:11,400
You heard it, right?

602
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,767
I'll get going.

603
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,967
Do you want to drop by my house before you go?

604
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,333
I want to go home, wash up, and rest.

605
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:21,000
They say the construction was almost delayed
because of the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

606
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,167
Chun Pil wished it would be delayed even more.

607
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,033
What?

608
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,633
So that he could see you for longer.

609
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:38,933
But he said he's sorry that he didn't
consider your feelings might get hurt.

610
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:42,867
He said there are many
other things he's sorry for.

611
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,533
Ah, it's home.

612
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:44,100
Finally, I'm in Seoul.

613
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,367
Now I can finally breathe.

614
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:54,200
Home is indeed the best.

615
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,633
Cheon Yeon Soo, do you know this feeling?

616
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:03,867
What am I saying right now?

617
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:06,600
Why am I suddenly talking about Cheon Yeon Soo?

618
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,767
Indeed, Arisu is the best
when it comes to tap water.

619
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,433
It seems like my skin has become rough
and dull because I didn't pay attention to it.

620
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,333
I shouldn't let it go like this.

621
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:02,267
Wow, it looks like my skin has improved.

622
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:04,867
Look at how firm it has become.

623
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,700
What if Cheon Yeon Soo doesn't recognize me?

624
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,433
I might have become so beautiful
that he might not recognize me.

625
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,000
Why do I keep talking about Cheon Yeon Soo?

626
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,333
Oh no.

627
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:27,300
<i>[Ji Kang Hee, Cheon Yeon Soo]</i>

628
00:51:58,933 --> 00:52:00,033
Will you throw it away?

629
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:02,700
Why did you come?

630
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,867
To clean.

631
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,467
- Kwon…
- Yes.

632
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:21,233
Please take this to Kang Hee's room…

633
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:22,333
Yes.

634
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,367
It's a call from Kang Hee.

635
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:56,033
Kang Hee, how's Seoul?

636
00:52:57,067 --> 00:52:58,667
You're bored without me, aren't you?

637
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:03,500
Bored? I have a lot to do as well.

638
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:07,667
Like doing laundry and making calls.

639
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,167
What about you?

640
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:13,600
How are you doing? Are Yeon Soo
and the others all doing well?

641
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,700
Ah, you miss me that much?

642
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,867
I'm in a good mood, so I'll hang up now.

643
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,033
<i>I'm also doing well…</i>

644
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:29,533
Hello?

645
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:37,800
Take a good rest in Seoul before you come back.

646
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,833
Yes.

647
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:43,267
Why?

648
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,333
Can't I just call without a reason?

649
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,333
Am I your lover or something? Hang up.

650
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm swamped with work.

651
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,533
Oh, yeah, yeah.

652
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:56,300
- Yeah.
- I'll hang up first then.

653
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,433
I'll hang up now, bye.

654
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:02,767
Ah, okay.

655
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:06,700
Oh, I'm doing well. We should
meet sometime, it's a pity.

656
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,767
Because I'm busy.

657
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:11,033
Sure, come visit sometime. Yeah, okay.

658
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,133
Yeah, sorry.

659
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,333
Ah, I got a call from Kang Hee.

660
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,433
I told her to take a good rest while
she's in Seoul and then come back.

661
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, yeah. I see.

662
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:30,667
<i>[Geum Seok Kyeong]</i>

663
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:50,167
So far, everything is progressing according
to schedule without major issues.

664
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:52,667
Isn't this the first time a rooftop
pool has been built in Hana-eup?

665
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:54,367
It's the first time, yes.

666
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,367
How about having the opening ceremony there?

667
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:03,533
The opening ceremony will of course be
planned with a Christmas party concept.

668
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,067
It's also a request from the client.

669
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:07,333
Sounds good.

670
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,633
How is the Yeonnam-dong project progressing?

671
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:11,767
How about trying a rooftop pool there too?

672
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,133
There is a cooling tower on the rooftop…

673
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,100
The load is an issue.

674
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,033
We'll know after a safety inspection.

675
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,700
<i>I will never forgive Mr. Chun Pil
and your mother.</i>

676
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:26,933
<i>What about me?</i>

677
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:28,833
<i>You…</i>

678
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:34,200
<i>Can you abandon your mother?</i>

679
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,500
Let's proceed that way.
Thank you for your hard work.

680
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,167
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Yes.

681
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:46,900
Kang Hee.

682
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:49,667
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

683
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,733
Yes, Ms. Hwang.

684
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:52,167
Our meeting is over.

685
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:54,400
Yes.

686
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,733
Do you have any concerns?

687
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,767
Shall we have a cup of tea?

688
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:03,133
Next time, I have an appointment.

689
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,567
Kang Hee.

690
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,967
Has the meeting ended?

691
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,067
Yes.

692
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:31,067
Did you get a scolding from Ms. Hwang?
Why do you look upset?

693
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:35,700
Let's go, I'll cheer you up.

694
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,100
I really didn't expect that.

695
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:42,767
About what?

696
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,367
I had no idea Seok Kyeong would
stay in the countryside that long.

697
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,033
He must be regretting it by now,

698
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,700
being bored with no work
at the construction site.

699
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,567
Not really?

700
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:56,467
He seemed busy.

701
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:04,400
Because of the construction,

702
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,800
the dust is making the color
of the wall start to change.

703
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,533
Start by cleaning the wall,

704
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:11,133
and then contact my secretary.

705
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:17,800
Look at how the floor in our store cracked
because of the construction shaking the ground.

706
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,300
You have some spare tiles, don't you?

707
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,300
Start with a safety inspection of the building,

708
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:24,233
and please ask our site manager.

709
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:32,233
Due to the construction noise, we have
no customers at the restaurant.

710
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:36,300
I'll check if it tastes good and then designate
it as the on-site cafeteria, okay?

711
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:42,200
You have your parents' permission, right?

712
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:48,000
I will choose my life partner myself.

713
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:51,167
Can you handle Ji Kang Hee?

714
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,500
Yes, more than enough.

715
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,067
Is your taste in women
the daughter of a motel owner?

716
00:57:58,067 --> 00:58:00,500
The daughter of the shop in
the next town is so pretty.

717
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,800
People are really visiting him day and night,

718
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,700
saying one of them is much prettier than you
and even trying to set him up with matches.

719
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,133
Anyway, he said it's incredibly busy.

720
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:19,272
It's a bit disconcerting.

721
00:58:19,816 --> 00:58:20,867
What is?

722
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:24,200
I'm amazed at how you know
his latest updates in such detail.

723
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:26,800
Because we're friends.

724
00:58:27,567 --> 00:58:31,233
We've been friends since we
were in our mothers' wombs.

725
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,700
Friends…

726
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,033
Did you know that friendship
is more persistent than love?

727
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:43,200
Because friendship is eternal.

728
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,467
Can we be friends?

729

730
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:45,667
Ji Kang Hee.

731
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:55,533
Do you know about the "white bear effect"?

732
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:58,533
They say, the more you try to forget,
the more you keep thinking about it.

733
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:01,033
So let's just

734
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,700
stay friends.

735
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:20,367
If you're going to eat, come on over.

736
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,533
Can't friends share ice cream?

737
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:18,367
Where's the spoon? If you're going
to eat, you need to bring a spoon.

738
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,467
Here it is.

739
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:26,400
What?

740
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,333
Can't friends even share a spoon?

741
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:34,067
That's not right, even as friends,
you should use separate spoons.

742
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,167
Go get one quickly, if you're going to eat.

743
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:39,500
I don't want to. It looks
like you'll eat it all.

744
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,667
It's already all gone because you came late.

745
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:42,833
Look at this.

746
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,333
Can you be friends with me?

747
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,467
I don't want to.
