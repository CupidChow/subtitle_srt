00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,633
<i>[Episode 2]</i>
In Motel California, there are a lot of things

2
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:18,533
made of wood there, right?

3
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,600
You know cockroaches are what
I fear the most in this world.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,267
I was looking straight ahead.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,633
And a cockroach with antennae

6
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:30,867
like this came towards me.

7
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:35,133
It suddenly stuck to my face…

8
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,000
It just…

9
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,633
I don't remember what happened next.

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,100
Hangover…

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,400
By the way, it's time for your mom to come.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,167
Yes.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,467
Oh right, you might not
be waiting for your mom.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,100
Yeon Soo.

15
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,133
Yes.

16
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,633
You surprised me, mister.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,667
Cockroaches are scary.

<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

<i>Kang Hee.</i>

26
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,733
<i>Kang Hee, let's go together.</i>

27
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,767
<i>Kang Hee, I said let's go together.</i>

28
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,533
<i>Where to? Where do you think I am going?</i>

29
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:30,733
<i>Anywhere.</i>

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,733
<i>Kang Hee, wherever you go,
I will be with you for life.</i>

31
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:35,833
<i>Why would you?</i>

32
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,700
<i>Because I like you.</i>

33
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,300
Excuse me.

34
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,167
Excuse me, please let go of me.

35
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,333
Kang Hee.

36
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,367
Grandfather has…

37
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,200
Grandfather has passed away, Kang Hee.

38
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,233
Cheon Yeon Soo?

39
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,933
What are they doing?

40
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,267
How could they do that unless
they're out of their minds?

41
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Move aside.

42
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,500
I have to say goodbye to Grandfather.

43
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,900
Oh, right.

44
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,667
Kang Hee, you are here.

45
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,567
I missed you, Kang Hee.

46
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,733
You are lying.

47
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,667
It's not a lie.

48
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,000
Then why did you do that to me back then?

49
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,767
I liked you so much.

50
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,433
Do you think everything will be
fine just by smiling like that?

51
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,967
Since it's in the past, I'll just let it go.

52
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:27,500
By the way, what on earth
did you do to Yeon Soo?

53
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,667
How much must you have made Yeon Soo
suffer for him to change like that?

54
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,700
Father, Father.

55
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,733
Yeon Soo, Father.

56
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,333
- Mom.
- Oh dear.

57
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,467
Mom, are you okay?

58
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:14,900
It's okay, it's okay.

59
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,200
Your mom always fell like this.

60
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,033
Jeez, Soon Ja.

61
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,333
- Mom.
- Get up, get up.

62
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,367
Oh, how embarrassing.

63
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,633
This won't do… carry her to the room, quickly…

64
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,533
- Yes.
- Mom.

65
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,267
Daughter, you came?

66
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,033
If someone saw you, they'd
think you are her husband.

67
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,967
Oh, what?

68
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,600
- Chun Pil.
- Oh, yes.

69
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,867
You were quite surprised, right?
It must've been hard coming over.

70
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,100
No, it wasn't hard…

71
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,800
That's not it, it's just that
our honeymoon is ruined…

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,167
You can go on your honeymoon again.

73
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,200
That's true. It's not like he is
going to pass away twice.

74
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Huh?

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,100
- Go change your clothes.
- Yes.

76
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,500
Wow, is she just leaving like that?

77
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
Without even acknowledging anyone?

78
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,767
- I'll bring her here.
- No, I don't want to force her to greet us.

79
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,467
- Where is Kang Hee?
- She left.

80
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,933
Without even acknowledging anyone.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,033
Oh my.

82
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,967
I don't want to see her anymore.

83
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,367
<i>She looked mixed when she was younger,
but it's harder to tell as she grew up.</i>

84
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:08,467
<i>She really looks more and more
like her mom as she grows up.</i>

85
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,000
<i>At times like this, it's fortunate
that Soon Ja isn't here, right?</i>

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,467
<i>- It's not Soon Ja, but it's Soo Ji…
- Soo Ji!</i>

87
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:17,167
<i>Honestly, Soon Ja may be a bit
odd, but what did they do wrong?</i>

88
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:20,667
<i>Come to think of it, Chun Pil
has been acting up a bit.</i>

89
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,500
<i>That's why either Soon Ja or Chun Pil, one of
them should have left the neighborhood.</i>

90
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,567
<i>Quiet, they might hear us…
What if she goes crazy again?</i>

91
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,633
<i>Right, hasn't she caused trouble in
the neighborhood once or twice before?</i>

92
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,033
Kang Hee.

93
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,333
Kang Hee.

94
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,167
Have something to eat before you go.

95
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,367
Are you telling me to go back in there?

96
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,500
- Huh?
- Everyone's just staring at me.

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,100
I feel like I've become a monkey at the zoo.

98
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,300
Isn't it better than no one
recognizing you at all?

99
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,367
What?

100
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,000
I was very flustered that
you didn't recognize me.

101
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,533
You came without expecting even that much?

102
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,400
You came here, fully aware of everything,
just to see your grandfather, didn't you?

103
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,667
It's the meal offered by Grandpa.

104
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,833
Come in and make sure to eat before you leave.

105
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,333
Jeez.

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,433
What's wrong with you?

107
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,700
Han Woo.

108
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,667
I talked back to Kang Hee.

109
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,133
What did you say back to her?

110
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,800
I told her to eat before leaving.

111
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,733
You told her to eat before leaving?

112
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,067
Do you think that's talking back?

113
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:56,133
I chased after her to say
thank you, but what did I do?

114
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,767
Should I not have told her to come in?

115
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,067
She's not coming in. Don't worry. Did
you forget what her personality is like?

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,133
She shouldn't come in…

117
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:10,100
Is he really Cheon Yeon Soo?

118
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,067
Ah Reum.

119
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,467
What about Ah Reum?

120
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:20,367
See her before you go. Ah Reum
has been waiting for you a lot.

121
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,167
She will be upset if you
don't see her before going.

122
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:46,267
This is my number, save it.

123
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,633
- Who are you?
- Why are you acting like that?

124
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,867
I'm here anyway.

125
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,100
I can sit here, right?

126
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,833
Do as you please.

127
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,133
Should I bring you some yukgaejang?

128
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,900
First, let's have a drink of soju.

129
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know about the others,
but they have to come.

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Why? Is there something wrong with them?

131
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,700
They're all like that.

132
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,567
- Gangster.
- They're all Kang Hee's gang or family.

133
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,867
Cha Seung Eon, Ryu Han Woo, and Cheon Yeon Soo.

134
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,700
And even Han Ah Reum.

135
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:30,700
Did you see Yeon Soo whining like
a loser as soon as Ji Kang Hee arrived?

136
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,333
He was totally whining.

137
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,633
I think they're going to the motel today.

138
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,333
- No way.
- Hey.

139
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,033
Of course, they should go to the motel.

140
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,400
They're a motel family, so they should go.

141
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,800
Then, are they motel gangsters?

142
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,667
Motel gangsters? What is that?

143
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,567
Doesn't it smell like a motel around here?

144
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,767
<i>Cha Seung Eon, your mom
left you at a motel, right?</i>

145
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:49,867
<i>You orphaned kid.</i>

146
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,233
<i>You don't even know your age, do you?</i>

147
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,533
<i>- Are you sure he's a guy?
- What should we do about Seung Eon?</i>

148
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>Should we wake Kang Hee?</i>

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
<i>I think we should.</i>

150
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,333
<i>- Kang Hee, wake up.
- Kang Hee, wake up.</i>

151
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,267
<i>Kang Hee, wake up.</i>

152
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,867
<i>Hey, try taking off his pants.</i>

153
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:07,867
<i>Oh, shall we?</i>

154
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,133
<i>- Take them off.
- Take them off quickly.</i>

155
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,733
<i>Hey, take them off quickly.</i>

156
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,900
<i>He took off his pants.</i>

157
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,767
<i>Hey!</i>

158
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:18,400
<i>Take them off quickly.</i>

159
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
<i>Hey!</i>

160
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:27,667
<i>Hey!</i>

161
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,600
<i>Seung Eon, are you okay? Let's go.</i>

162
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,567
<i>Are you okay?</i>

163
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,267
<i>Don't cry, don't cry.</i>

164
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:39,700
<i>Can you walk?</i>

165
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,167
<i>Hey, Ji Kang Hee.</i>

166
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,567
<i>You're living in a motel
without a home, aren't you?</i>

167
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,100
<i>What's the matter with living in a motel?</i>

168
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,900
<i>Oh, right. Han Woo, you
live in a barn, don't you?</i>

169
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,467
<i>Ugh, you smell like cow dung.</i>

170
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,067
<i>How about we call him "cow dung" from now on?</i>

171
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,567
<i>- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Good.</i>

172
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,800
<i>Don't tease each other.</i>

173
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,933
<i>Get lost, Cheon Yeon Soo, you pig.</i>

174
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,433
<i>Hey, Kim Heon Yeol.</i>

175
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,500
<i>If you keep doing that,
you'll get struck by lightning.</i>

176
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>Lightning?</i>

177
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:17,467
<i>I guess you have that ability
because you're a mutt?</i>

178
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:19,900
<i>- Mutt? What's that?
- Mutt? What's that?</i>

179
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,233
<i>Mutt!</i>

180
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,600
<i>Her mother is a mutt, so she is also…</i>

181
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,100
<i>I'm not a mutt, okay?</i>

182
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,400
<i>"I'm not a mutt, okay?"</i>

183
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>She's a mutt. She's a mutt.</i>

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,667
<i>She's a mutt. She's a mutt.</i>

185
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>She's a mutt. She's a mutt.</i>

186
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,867
<i>She's a mutt. She's a mutt.</i>

187
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,933
<i>She's a mutt.</i>

188
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,200
Ah Reum.

189
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,400
I thought I'd forgotten everything.

190
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,400
Forgotten what?

191
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,700
Hey.

192
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,300
Oh my, you startled me.

193
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,967
Can I join you here?

194
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,633
Oh yeah, Kang Hee.

195
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,067
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

196
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,167
Have you been well?

197
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,333
Of course.

198
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,933
Who is this person?

199
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,233
What are you talking about?

200
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,800
He's not our schoolmate, right?

201
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Don't you remember Kim Heon Yeol?

202
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,267
Oh, Kim Heon Yeol.

203
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,633
The one who got struck by lightning, right?

204
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,167
Right?

205
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,967
You remember me.

206
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:51,133
Come over to practice golf sometime.

207
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,400
Do you play golf?

208
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,567
No, I've been a bit busy with work.

209
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,033
What do you do for a living?

210
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,900
I just work at a company.

211
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
I'll give you one of my business cards, too.

212
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,833
Me too, thanks.

213
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,567
It's all in English. Kang Hee, you made it big.

214
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,600
Is it a foreign company?

215
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,167
The company has some shares in the UK.

216
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,400
I haven't heard of that company.

217
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,700
It's the top in the interior industry.

218
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,433
Any famous hotel or shopping mall these
days has been renovated by our company.

219
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,200
Then you must be getting a good salary.

220
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,533
Why are you curious about
someone else's salary?

221
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,933
That's so old-fashioned.

222
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:39,967
Old-fashioned?

223
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:44,467
What's wrong with you again?

224
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:47,133
I don't know, I'm too anxious
to listen to what she's saying.

225
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,300
Ji Kang Hee?

226
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,933
People living in Seoul? They
may say they live in Seoul.

227
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:55,567
But they're probably in some
small house on the outskirts,

228
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,833
eating instant noodles.

229
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,167
It's funny how they try to act
fancy and wear luxury brands.

230
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,533
Isn't it better than acting all cocky just
because your parents have money?

231
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,767
What? What did you say?

232
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,300
You heard what I said.
Don't act like you didn't.

233
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,733
Whether I eat instant noodles in a room
on the outskirts or carry luxury items,

234
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,167
I'm taking responsibility for my own life.

235
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,467
I haven't seen any of those girls
who left the city turn out well.

236
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:23,333
They'll live a miserable life, be with any man,

237
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,467
recklessly get pregnant, and then
eventually find some fool to marry her.

238
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,533
Hey!

239
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,100
You're not in a position to talk, having gotten
a bar girl pregnant and suspended from school.

240
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,233
- Stop it.
- Your level of decency hasn't changed…

241
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,700
What are you doing?

242
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,467
- Hey, hey!
- Kang Hee, are you okay?

243
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:39,500
Stop it, Heon Yeol.

244
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,600
- Did I do something wrong? Huh?
- No, it's not that.

245
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,033
Calm down.

246
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,367
Why? What?

247
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,533
Calm down.

248
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,267
What are you doing?

249
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,433
It was nice to meet you.

250
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,967
Kang Hee, you…

251
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
- Kim Heon Yeol, calm down.
- Hey, move aside.

252
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,300
Hey, hey!

253
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,667
Ji Kang Hee!

254
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,367
Are you okay, Kang Hee?

255
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,800
Move aside, you rat.

256
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,167
Why does the chief mourner
just keep hugging the girl?

257
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,167
What's so great about a mutt like her?

258
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,367
Hey, Yeon Soo.

259
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,033
Yeon Soo, what's wrong? It's not like you.

260
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,733
Thanks for coming, Kang Hee.

261
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,367
Be careful on your way back.

262
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,033
Seung Eon.

263
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,667
Please take Kang Hee outside.

264
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,433
Let's go.

265
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,333
Are you crazy? What are you trying to do?

266
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:27,867
Hey.

267
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,233
Mister, let me go first…

268
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,833
Why, why?

269
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:33,567
Huh?

270
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,267
He cleaned up your room for you.

271
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,167
Let's go.

272
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:01,333
The neighborhood's all quiet without her.

273
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,667
Why would she cause a scene
at other people's funerals?

274
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,367
She has come to pay respects
after hearing the obituary.

275
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,867
She also made the effort and
came with good intentions.

276
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:15,267
If she's coming after 10 years, she
should at least greet the elders first.

277
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:18,033
Why is she starting a fight?

278
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,067
I'm the one who fought, Mom.

279
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,167
Ji Kang Hee started it, right?

280
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:27,033
Why do you keep saying that?
What has Kang Hee done wrong?

281
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:34,267
Thinking of my brother,
I shouldn't be like this.

282
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,433
But she is really…

283
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,233
If you don't want to see your mom die,

284
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,233
never get involved with her.

285
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,700
I shouldn't have come.

286
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,667
I'm happy to see you.

287
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you, Cha Seung Eon.

288
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,533
Thank you for living with Chun Pil.

289
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,467
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

290
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Hey.

291
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,233
You couldn't eat properly earlier, right?

292
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:20,833
I'll prepare it for you.

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,633

<i>If I keep enduring here,</i>

295
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,600
<i>like that motel, my life will also get dark.</i>

296
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,133
<i>Even if I'm here?</i>

297
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:43,167
<i>You're doing just fine.</i>

298
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,867
<i>But I can't endure it.</i>

299
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>I'll never come back here again.</i>

300
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:24,767
<i>Is it heavy?</i>

301
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,333
<i>Shall I take it?</i>

302
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,333
You shouldn't have done that.

303
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,867
Kim Heon Yeol, that guy, couldn't
even breathe and was gasping.

304
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,733
It was so scary, like something might happen.

305
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,300
I didn't know I was that strong either.

306
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,933
Since it was my first time using my fists.

307
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:23,400
Kim Heon Yeol might sue you.

308
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,133
It doesn't matter.

309
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,833
I've always wanted to hit
him at least once in my life.

310
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,267
I feel the same way.

311
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,333
Honestly, it felt refreshing.

312
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:37,233
Kim Heon Yeol used to trouble us a lot, right?

313
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:41,233
When we were kids, it was always
Kang Hee who fought for us, right?

314
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Right.

315
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,500
Seung Eon, where's Kang Hee?

316
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,567
She left.

317
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,833
She said she didn't think it would
be of any help anyway and left.

318
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,000
What's going on?

319
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,800
I think it's because of that
Kim Heon Yeol thing earlier.

<i>I resigned, so I'm no longer
the person in charge. Sorry.</i>

326
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,733
What? Did she hang up?

327
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,800
What? Why is he calling me?

328

<i>I was about to say that.</i>

351
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,600
<i>The client has arrived here.</i>

352
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,333
<i>Why did you drink so much?</i>

353
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,864
<i>- Because I don't want to have regrets.
- Regrets?</i>

354
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,067
<i>Regrets?</i>

355
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:14,433
<i>A design that won't be nitpicked by Mr. Mok.</i>

356
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,767
<i>I know how to do that too.</i>

357
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,367
<i>But that's…</i>

358
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,233
<i>That's an obvious design that
could be done at any house.</i>

359
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:29,867
<i>It lacks sincerity and uniqueness.</i>

360
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,433
<i>Still,</i>

361
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:36,500
<i>I don't want to regret thinking</i>

362
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,700
<i>"I should've done that."</i>

363
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:44,533
<i>Is that why you're drinking
alone like this now?</i>

364
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,133
It has to be a dream.

365
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,500
It has to be a dream.

366
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,267
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

367
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,167
I saw your design, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

368
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,500
It felt like I was splashed with ice water.

369
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,767
It really woke me up.

370
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,600
Next time, let's meet as
a designer, not as my assistant.

371
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Yes.

372
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,500
Come over here.

373
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,400
Why are you being so insistent?

374
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,333
You said you have to meet Mr. Mok.

375
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:16,233
Today, it's not a battle,
so you can just enjoy it.

376
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:19,433
It's kind of the leisure of a winner.

377
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,733
It's a congratulatory gift.

378
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:30,067
What? You did something like that
and didn't even realize it yourself.

379
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,733
Pardon?

380
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,433
<i>Now, nothing has been left out, right?</i>

381
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,000
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

382
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
<i>And all the sample boards
have been loaded into the car?</i>

383
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,667
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

384
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,500
<i>But why are we having
the meeting at the Elitree Hotel?</i>

385
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,867
<i>The CEO said that</i>

386
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:45,867
<i>our client is the 3rd generation
of the Elitree Hotel.</i>

387
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,167
<i>- The next one, please.
- Yes.</i>

388
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,333
<i>Next, please.</i>

389
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:58,600
<i>Yes.</i>

390
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:07,267
<i>Thank you for the perfect
preparation, Director.</i>

391
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,767
<i>Yes, you can look forward to it.</i>

392
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:14,100
<i>She really likes it.</i>

393
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,800
<i>It seems you can proceed just like this.</i>

394
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,833
<i>I'll confirm the materials
myself along the way.</i>

395
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:24,000
<i>- What kind of…
- I've received the draft from Ms. Ji Kang Hee.</i>

396
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,400
<i>She reflected everything I said
without missing a single thing.</i>

397
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
<i>I was completely moved.</i>

398
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,633
<i>Why didn't you come with her?</i>

399
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,967
<i>Well… She kept staying up all night…</i>

400
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,100
<i>You know about the village we're
building in Cheongdam-dong, right?</i>

401
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
<i>Yeah, the club-style village.</i>

402
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,533
<i>It's said that all the residents are
either top stars or young and rich.</i>

403
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,667
<i>I'd like to commission the interior
design there. Is it possible?</i>

404
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,367
<i>Like this time, customizing
it to fit the client's needs.</i>

405
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,933
<i>Of course, that's possible.</i>

406
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:55,700
<i>Thank you.</i>

407
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,248
<i>I would like Ms. Ji Kang Hee to
take charge of the residents' meeting.</i>

408
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,567
<i>Please make sure to come
with her to the next meeting.</i>

409
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:13,667
<i>Director, please help me.</i>

410
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,600
<i>You can contact Ji Kang Hee, right?</i>

411
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,700
<i>We need to hire her right away.</i>

412
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,800
<i>Please, just contact her once.</i>

413
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:25,800
<i>Please, I beg you.</i>

414
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,467
Project team leader?

415
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:32,633
I've reviewed your resume and portfolio again.

416
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:36,767
Without prejudice or preconception.
You are fully qualified.

417
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:37,967
Ms. Ji.

418
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:43,133
I wanted to share the happy news
quickly, but why couldn't I reach you?

419
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,900
I've been to a funeral.

420
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,933
Let's do well from now on.

421
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,433
I've thought of something at the funeral.

422
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,033
I never know when a person will die.

423
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:59,567
What's the greatest luxury I
could indulge in while I'm alive?

424
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,267
Luxury?

425
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:04,467
Not working with people I dislike.

426
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,000
That's my luxury.

427
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,067
So, you are going to refuse?

428
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,667
This incredible offer?

429
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,400
We fired each other here, didn't we?

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,233
<i>- You're fired!
- No!</i>

431
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:18,933
<i>It's you, the manager, who is fired.</i>

432
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:21,100
<i>You are completely out of my life!</i>

433
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,733
<i>Out!</i>

434
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:28,000
No.

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,467
Sell it.

436
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:32,333
Sell me just that draft, at least.

437
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,000
I know someone who will pay more for it.

438
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,533
Someone who would buy my design
at such an unbelievably high price

439
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:40,367
that someone like you, Manager,
could never dream of affording it.

440
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,767
Ms. Ji Kang Hee, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

441
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Is the money insufficient?

442
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,667
I told you to put in plenty
of money. How much is it?

443
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:22,733
Oh my.

444
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,200
How much should I offer to make
it possible, Ms. Ji Kang Hee?

445
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,700
I've already received it.

446
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:28,700
More than enough.

447
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,667
My self-esteem as a designer.

448
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,933
You paid me more than anyone else in the world.

449
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,333
Thank you, both of you.

450
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,367
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

451
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,633
Let's be friends.

452
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:10,300
It's not an envelope of money,
but a wedding invitation.

453
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,667
You must come because you're my friend.

454
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
I'll definitely come.

455
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,567
Because we're friends.

456
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,267
Why does that look like an envelope of money?

457
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Yeah, pride is more important than money.

458
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:06,733
<i>[Interruption of hot water supply
due to water system issues]</i>

459
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:14,467
Kang Hee, the water pipe burst,
so the boiler isn't working.

460
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,500
But I need to shower.

461
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,867
Oh my, there's no hot water, and
the heating isn't working either.

462
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:21,600
You can't even use the bathroom for a while.

463
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,933
Maybe use wet wipes or something.

464
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,667
- Yeah.
- Yeah, where are you?

465
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:55,533
Where else? The office, of course.

466
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,167
<i>Can you talk for a moment?</i>

467
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,633
Yeah, what's up?

468
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:05,133
I have to go to Seoul this weekend, and I
wonder if you could let me stay for one night.

469
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:12,167
Oh, I have to go on a business trip,
so I won't be in Seoul for a while.

470
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,233
I'll call you when I'm back.

471
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,533
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

472
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,700
Yeah.

473
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,533
Liar.

474
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,000
Why? What did she say?

475
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,367
Kang Hee handed out business cards
to people at the funeral, didn't she?

476
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:34,067
But the others were so suspicious
that I called to check.

477
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,767
But they said there's no such person.

478
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,667
But she said that she's at the company now.

479
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,767
She even says she'll be on a business
trip during the weekend.

480
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,167
She must have some kind of trouble, too.

481
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,233
That's probably the case.

482
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,433
But she should be able to tell me.

483
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,367
Why doesn't she even tell me?

484
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,667
I'm hurt.

485
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,033
Excuse me, could you help me with this?

486
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,233
No.

487
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,833
Come here, oh my, cutie.

488
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,467
That's right, that's right.

489
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,633
- Thank you.
- Come this way.

490
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,233
Oh, got it.

491
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,800
Thank you.

492
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:19,100
Come in.

493
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,967
- You're from the veterinary department, right?
- Oh, yes.

494
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,900
Could you let go of this,
please? I really need to hurry.

495
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,300
They're all test dogs, aren't they?

496
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,333
Yes.

497
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,167
I really need to go quickly.

498
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,967
Oh, wait a moment. What are you doing now?

499
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,200
Just a moment, I'll explain.

500
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,600
Yeah, are you busy?

501
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,633
Sorry, but could you come
quickly to the school?

502
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,533
Please help me. No.

503
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,300
Yeah, come quickly. Thank you.

504
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,233
I really struggled to help these dogs escape.

505
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:54,900
Let me explain.

506
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,167
Where did you just call?

507
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,100
I can't take a single step until they arrive.

508
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,267
What are you doing…

509
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,567
I really had a hard time freeing these dogs.

510
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,900
Yeah? Please help me just once.

511
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,933
Please.

512
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,200
- Thank you, senior.
- Yes.

513
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:22,833
I managed to help them
escape with great difficulty.

514
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,500
Without even knowing properly…

515
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,933
Are they for drug testing? Toxicity testing?

516
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,733
Euthanasia may be performed
depending on the results.

517
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:34,533
Have you ever heard of "Footsteps of Sharing"?

518
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:38,300
Of course, they protect abandoned dogs and
also support the adoption of experimental dogs.

519
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,467
That's the club I created when I was in school,
dealing with similar struggles like yours.

520
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:42,767
Make sure to stop by if you have time.

521
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:46,100
"Footsteps of Sharing"…

522
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,900
Then, are you perhaps Senior Cheon Yeon Soo?

523
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:55,267
Hello. My name is Yoon Nan Woo, class of 2016.

524
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Thank you very much, Senior.

525
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,600
Don't worry too much
about them. They'll be fine.

526
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,333
Let's go, Ah Reum.

527
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,033
Oh, hello?

528
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,367
Hello.

529
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,833
Why? What's the matter?

530
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,333
I have something to ask you.

531
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,800
Yes, what is it? Ask away.

532
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:43,500
This might sound a bit strange,

533
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,833
and you might feel a bit offended.

534
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,033
It's okay, ask. What is it?

535
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:50,667
By any chance, are you
the girlfriend of Senior Yeon Soo?

536
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,600
What?

537
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,700
Girlfriend…

538
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,867
I'm just his friend.

539
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:03,767
Oh, that's a relief.

540
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,733
Then, by any chance, does he have a girlfriend?

541
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,267
As it turns out, he is really popular,

542
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,100
and there are actually so many
people who claim to be his girlfriend.

543
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:16,100
That's all nonsense. Yeon Soo
doesn't have a girlfriend.

544
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,000
But why are you curious about that?

545
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,767
That day he helped the beagles,
and every time I saw him,

546
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,633
he gave me a lot of advice about my worries.

547
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:28,133
I'm just really grateful to
him for so many things.

548
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:30,933
I want to buy him a meal at least once…

549
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:33,067
- And?
- Senior Yeon Soo…

550
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:35,467
Do you happen to know what he's doing

551
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,133
on Christmas Eve?

552
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:40,633
I don't know either, go ask him.

553
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,067
Please tell me.

554
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,700
I really don't know. Ask Yeon Soo.

555
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,467
It's fine, it's fine. I really need to do it.

556
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:50,833
<i>[Salvation Army donation kettle]</i>

557
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:03,633
Ready, one, two.

558
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:05,667
Okay, great.

559
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,100
Friends.

560
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,667
- Esther.
- Esther, congratulations.

561
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,700
- Thank you.
- Aren't you nervous?

562
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,367
- Are you okay?
- The dress is so beautiful.

563
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,900
Alright, I'm going to take a photo.

564
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,333
One, two, three.

565
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,800
Smile a bit more, please. Yes, one, two, three.

566
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,300
Ms. Kang Hee.

567
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,833
Ms. Kang Hee.

568
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:24,533
Congratulations.

569
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,133
Thank you.

570
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,700
Do you want to come to the after-party later?

571
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,967
I have a prior appointment.

572
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,633
Then let's meet up later.

573
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,133
Director.

574
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:51,500
Oh? Lipstick! Right?

575
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,067
- Yes.
- I knew it would suit you.

576
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:57,400
Oh, right. I heard you didn't receive
the design fee in the end.

577
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,700
Why did you do that?
Seok Kyeong has a lot of money.

578
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,633
It was because of you.

579
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,667
- Me?
- Thanks to you, Director.

580
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,833
I wanted to live a more luxurious life.

581
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Not living so stubbornly.

582
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,433
Ms. Kang Hee.

583
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:15,567
I love you.

584
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,933
You said you liked men.

585
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,767
I won't ask to live together.
Instead, let's work together.

586
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:26,700
I left the company because
of you, Ms. Kang Hee.

587
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
Pardon?

588
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,733
I kept thinking about what you said.

589
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:33,267
The luxury of not working
with people I dislike.

590
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:36,333
I wanted to experience that luxury once too.

591
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,133
So now you're responsible for me, Ms. Kang Hee.

592
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,700
Let's talk with a new year's fresh mood.

593
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:50,067
It's been a while.

594
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:53,233
- It's been such a long time.
- Right.

595
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:57,800
Wow.

596
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,567
What? Am I that pretty?

597
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,767
Korean makeup is truly the best.

598
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
I admit it.

599
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,133
Be happy.

600
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:17,867
You'll regret it for life for letting me go.

601
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:19,600
- Huh?
- See?

602
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,200
It looks like your eyes are full of regret.

603
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,233
Sorry to say this, but I've met a girl I like.

604
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:27,400
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

605
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,600
That's good to hear.

606
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,233
I felt bad for being the only one married.

607
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,800
But why didn't you come together?

608
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,900
You're asking me to bring her here,
where my parents are?

609
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,533
When will you introduce her?

610
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,033
Soon.

611
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,233
There was an industrial spy here.

612
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,633
Then go ahead and report me.

613
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,300
I guess these days, everyone uses spruce trees.

614
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,467
Because it's much more splendid than a fir.

615
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,800
Didn't you say you had plans?

616
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,133
It's an evening appointment,
so there's still some time.

617
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:26,033
Oh? Then, do you want to go
check out the top floor's suite?

618
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:31,700
It's not something like after party.

619
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,533
I'll be partying all night there,
so come after your appointment.

620
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,833
We've also booked a room
and will be up all night.

621
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,300
Oh, sorry.

622
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,733
On a day like today, you naturally
spend it with your boyfriend.

623
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,467
Have a good time then.

624
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:14,733
<i>Welcome.</i>

625
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,467
<i>- Chun Pil, do you have money?
- Huh?</i>

626
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:29,567
<i>Do you need money?</i>

627
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,367
<i>Why?</i>

628
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:38,967
<i>I asked if you need money.</i>

629
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:40,400
<i>Be quiet.</i>

630
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,533
<i>Wow.</i>

631
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:04,433
<i>We share the same birthday. December 25th.</i>

632
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:05,467
<i>It's incredible.</i>

633
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:08,067
<i>Your birthday is calculated
by the lunar calendar.</i>

634
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:14,400
<i>Let's standardize it to Christmas,
so it's easy to remember.</i>

635
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,433
<i>That wouldn't be respectful to
the grandmother who gave birth to you.</i>

636
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:23,333
<i>Alright, then I'll be the one who's unfilial.</i>

637
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,900
<i>You do the filial duty.</i>

638
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,167
<i>Why should I?</i>

639
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,033
<i>How nice is it?</i>

640
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:33,133
<i>On such a wonderful day, it's
so great to meet once a year,</i>

641
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:36,733
<i>celebrate our birthdays,</i>

642
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:38,833
<i>and spend Christmas together.</i>

643
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,033
<i>Come here.</i>

644
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,700
<i>Like this,</i>

645
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,000
<i>we will be together for life, okay?</i>

646
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:52,333
<i>One, two, three.</i>

647
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:57,767
I should have rejected it back then.

648
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,933
What time is it?

649
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:07,867
<i>[Ah Reum]</i>

650
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,933
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

651
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:18,267
You remembered my birthday.

652
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:21,500
Of course, we've been together for so long.

653
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,967
What about now? Aren't we
staying together anymore?

654
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,033
We all scattered, you know.

655
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:30,767
That's right, I heard Han Woo
is proposing today.

656
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,967
<i>She's a female coworker at the same
company, and they've been dating for a while.</i>

657
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:35,100
What about Seung Eon?

658
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:46,100
I don't know.

659
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,767
If he's not working, he's probably off
to the mountains or something.

660
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:52,367
<i>Are you meeting Mr. Chun Pil
at the hotel again today?</i>

661
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:53,533
Yeah.

662
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:55,733
But why don't you ask?

663
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,900
The person you really want to
ask about is Yeon Soo, isn't it?

664
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,433
What about Yeon Soo?

665
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,667
Is he okay?

666
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:10,800
Is he doing well?

667
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,400
<i>Oh, don't even mention it.</i>

668
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,333
<i>Kim Heon Yeol's father was making a big fuss,</i>

669
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:19,133
<i>calling the police and threatening to
sue Yeon Soo. Your father stopped them.</i>

670
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,867
He suffered because of me.

671
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,767
I should give him a call later and apologize.

672
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:26,533
<i>Yeah, but if you're going
to do it, do it quickly.</i>

673
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:27,400
Why?

674
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,300
Yeon Soo might have…

675
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,000
He might have a date in the evening.

676
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,867
<i>[Kang Hee]</i>

677
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:16,067
Hello, hello.

678
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,900
Hello?

679
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,267
<i>Is this Cheon Yeon Soo?</i>

680
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,333
Oh, Kang Hee.

681
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,233
<i>Senior.</i>

682
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,300
Wow, you look great today.

683
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,067
Huh?

684
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,400
No, Kang Hee, hold on.

685
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,067
Just a minute.

686
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:48,000
Please go ahead and make
the call. I'll go and order.

687
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,200
It seems like you're with someone
else right now? Let's talk later.

688
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,967
<i>No, Kang Hee, that's not it…</i>

689
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:57,200
Kang Hee.

690
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:06,533
Timing is…

691
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:11,133
Chun Pil, let's not meet today.

692
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:14,133
<i>Suddenly? Why? Is something wrong?</i>

693
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:15,900
I'm over thirty now.

694
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,933
I don't want to receive a birthday
congratulation from you, Chun Pil.

695
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:22,433
Until another man comes into
your life, I should take care of it.

696
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:24,400
There is another man.

697
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,067
Then bring him along.

698
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:27,100
Chun Pil.

699
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,100
After checking in, I'll send you a text.

700
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,867
Let's meet in the room later.

701
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:34,300
Chun Pil.

702
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:49,900
Ms. Kang Hee.

703
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:54,733
Shall we sit together?

704
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,167
If you promise not to talk to me…

705
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,267
Let's just drink in silence, both of us.

706
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,033
<i>Elitree Hotel, Room 2020.</i>

707
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,567
Can I ask you a favor?

708
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:33,900
Let's listen to it first.

709
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,833
There is a man claiming ownership of me.

710
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:41,033
I want to get away from that man.

711
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,767
Can I use you, Mr. Seok Kyeong?

712
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,100
Could I… just link arms with you for a moment?

713
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:04,267
I'm Geum Seok Kyeong.

714
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,267
<i>It's that man.</i>

715
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,167
Wow.

716
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:34,500
Who would have thought to see
such a stage at a Korean beef festival?

717
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,267
Please give them another big round of applause.

718
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:48,500
Mister, now will you please
tell me where Kang Hee lives?

719
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,933
Well…

720
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,467
Please tell us, mister.

721
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:56,933
We agreed to let him know once we perform.
Otherwise, he won't be able to hold on anymore.

722
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:02,267
I heard she's in a Goshiwon in Sillim-dong.

723
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,200
- What Goshiwon?
- Oh, that's…

724
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,433
I promised her I wouldn't tell.

725
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:10,067
What kind of father says that? Please tell me.

726
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:12,900
Isn't it cool? Meeting just once
a year at the end of the year.

727
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,133
Discussing life in a luxury hotel,

728
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,400
discussing movies and music,

729
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,400
dining with the best room service.

730
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,800
Then parting ways cleanly, just like we do.

731
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:29,567
Mister, please tell me.
I will really get angry.

732
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:30,833
Move aside, you punk.

733
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:32,900
No, I'll stick to you until you tell me.

734
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,367
You brat.

735
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,733
Han Woo, is there a convenience
store in the subway too?

736
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:38,800
Be quiet.

737
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,533
Oh, Han River! Han River!

738
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:42,167
Wow, it's really long.

739
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,600
I said be quiet, you country bumpkin.

740
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
Why? You are a country bumpkin too.

741
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,900
Oh my.

742
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,100
These are all Goshiwon.

743
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,300
When will we find her here?

744
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,633
There are really a lot.

745
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,433
Ask that person over there.

746
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:57,167
You ask him.

747
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,633
You do it.

748
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:00,600
- You just ask him.
- Just once.

749
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,533
Alright, alright.

750
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:04,433
Hello, sir.

751
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:07,800
Is there a person named
Ji Kang Hee living in here?

752
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,500
She's about this tall, and she's a girl.

753
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,933
<i>[Goshiwon]</i>

754
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,433
Wow, is there a goshiwon in a place like this?

755
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:17,033
It's right up there at the top.

756
00:58:17,033 --> 00:58:19,033
Let's go up there and then grab some food.

757
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:21,300
Let's go quickly.

758
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:23,967
I'll go ahead.

759
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,167
Let's eat Korean beef, Korean beef.

760
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,000
Next time we come up here, we should
also stop by a convenience store.

761
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,600
Ah Reum said that Kang Hee is working
part-time at the convenience store.

762
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:35,933
Then,

763
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:38,767
are you saying you're going to visit

764
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:41,367
every convenience store in downtown Seoul?

765
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,700
Yeah, we can just start with the ones nearby.

766
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,333
This is like looking for a needle
in a haystack, Yeon Soo.

767
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,933
Just give up.

768
00:58:47,933 --> 00:58:49,567
Why are you so negative?

769
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:56,233
As long as I'm looking for her, we're
still under the same sky in Seoul.

770
00:58:56,233 --> 00:59:00,600
Maybe Kang Hee is also looking
at that moon right now with me, right?

771
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:02,700
You crazy.

772
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:06,767
If you're going to do it, do it on
your own. I can't do it anymore.

773
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,667
- I can't do it anymore.
- Why? Let's go together.

774
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,500
Why go together? How long
will it take to find her?

775
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,367
- But we're friends.
- That's not it.

776
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:15,500
There are too many convenience stores.
There's one over there, and also behind there.

777
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,367
I won't eat it.

778
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:21,000
Don't eat. If you keep eating like
this, you'll need insulin next year.

779
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,067
You… Where are you going?

780
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:24,167
To buy dessert.

781
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:26,000
Oh my.

782
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:30,733
Hello.

783
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:34,267
Is there another part-time worker here?

784
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,200
I found her.

785
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,633
You go in and out of hotels
with older men, don't you?

786
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:55,167
It's none of your business
who I go to a hotel with.

787
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,567
How much do you get paid to do that?

788
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:59,433
Don't worry about how much I'm getting,
just give me the overdue salary.

789
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:02,400
Do you really need to be reported
to come to your senses?

790
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,167
You should be thankful that I haven't
reported you for sponsoring prostitution.

791
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:08,133
If you don't pay my overdue salary
right now, I'll be the one to report you.

792
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:10,833
You're just a pathetic pervert, trying to hit
on people under the guise of a part-time job.

793
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,567
Do you think I'd go to
a hotel with you for that?

794
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:13,800
What?

795
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,833
Pathetic pervert?

796
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:17,867
How dare…

797
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,400
Say it again, say it again! Say it again!

798
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,667
How dare…

799
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:26,700
What the heck.

800
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,667
What did you say?

801
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,367
Did you just say "heck" now?

802
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:33,100
How dare you…

803
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,433
Oh, hold on.

804
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:37,333
I've recorded videos of him abusing
you, so report him with this.

805
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,433
It looks like you'll be the one
getting reported, Boss.

806
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:43,100
My arm is going to fall off.

807
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,400
Stay still.

808
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:47,767
Let go of my arm, and then we can talk.

809
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:49,167
Oh, just a second, my arm, my arm!

810
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,233
Stay still.

811
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:52,300
Oh my, my arm is going to fall off.

812
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,467
Oh, hold on. Let go of my
arm, and then we can talk.

813
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,467
Drink this and go back.

814
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,433
You too, this…

815
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,800
Why are you giving me this?

816
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:23,167
There are many people who make
things hard for me, even without you.

817
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:24,800
So don't come looking for me again.

818
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:29,300
This isn't a request, but an order.

819
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:45,067
- I'll send you the video.
- Thank you.

820
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:47,467
- Here.
- Yes.

821
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:50,467
Oh yes, just a moment please.

822
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,033
Yes, it's done.

823
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:55,500
- Thank you.
- Yes.

824
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,700
Please transfer the ownership
of Kang Hee to me.

825
01:03:33,633 --> 01:03:35,133
I will take responsibility for her.
