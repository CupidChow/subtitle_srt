- Kwon?
- Yes.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,567
Has there been any contact from Kang Hee?

4
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:24,033
A little while ago, she went up with ice cream.

5
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,400
- Kang Hee came?
- Yes.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,100
What's with the ice cream? She's not a child.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,867
She didn't bring mine?

8
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,167
What?

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
So, Kang Hee has returned.

10
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,567

Wait.

15
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,933
Is this Kang Hee's?

16
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,667
Ji Chun Pil's daughter, Ji Kang Hee.

17
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,267
Open the door, please.

18
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:31,733
- Hide! Hide!
- Huh?

19
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,400
I told you to hide!

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,933
Welcome drink prepared
wholeheartedly for my daughter.

21
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,967
Home sweet home.

22
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,533
Open the door, will you, Kang Hee?

23
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,333
No, does it have to be now?

24
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:49,433
Please open the door.
Your welcome drink has arrived.

25
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:53,300
It's a beautiful day. Please open the door.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Welcome to your sweet home!
This was your dad's dream.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,633
A thoughtful dad dedicating
this to his daughter.

28
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,567
It's locked.

29
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:13,033
Kang Hee, did you see the flowers in the vase?

30
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:17,467
- Yes.
- While walking along the path,

31
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,833
I found the wildflowers so beautiful,
so I brought them for you.

32
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,867
I just put them there for you…

33
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,733
Won't you open the door?

34
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,033
I'll go out.

35
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,500
Go out, where to? I'm outside now.

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,133
- I'll go out.
- Oh, my head.

37
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,967
Ah, sorry.

38
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,467
I'm sorry, are you okay?

39
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,033
What's going on in your room?

40
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:44,033
What could be there? How can
you come unannounced like this?

41
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,867
How do you know who I'd be with?
How can you just show up like this?

42
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,200
- Who were you with?
- No.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,433
It's not that I'm with someone,
but what if I had been?

44
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,600
Ms. Kang Hee.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,267
- You should've told me you're coming.
- Were you with someone?

46
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:54,633
No!

47
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,967
How long has it been for us?

48
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,800
My goodness?

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,433
Why is everyone coming to my room?

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,000
Dad's like this, you know.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,067
The two of you talk comfortably.

52
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,267
Thank you.

53
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,867
My room is here. Yes.

54
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,900
Please go in and talk.

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,167
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

56
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,900
- Please go in.
- Then, I'll take a look at your room…

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,733
Let's go down and talk.

58
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,533
Ah, come quickly.

59
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,100
- He said go in…
- Where would you go uninvited?

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,200
This is driving me crazy.

61
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,600
Hearing about Ms. Kang Hee's arrival
from someone else would be inconvenient.

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,067
If your boyfriend doesn't even
know that, how weird would it look?

63
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,233
- Daughter.
- Why?

64
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,800
Hide! Hide!

65
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,633
Why did I do that?

66
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:03,133
Right? You'll reflect on it, won't you?

67
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,333
I understand.

68
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,567
You wanted to give me a surprise, didn't you?

69
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,533
Will he be angry?

70
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,867
Don't worry, I'm not angry.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,967
Ms. Kang Hee.

72
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,467
Yes?

73
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,500
It's like the mood has changed a bit.

74
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,967
What has changed, exactly?

75
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,600
You've said all you had to, right?

76
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,767
See you tomorrow.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,900
Can you be friends with me?

78
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,700
I don't want to.

79
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,533
You went out.

80
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:20,900
Yes. I was just about to call.

81
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,533
Why?

82
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,967
You first, you called.

83
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,733
Shall we meet for a moment?

84
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,367
Shall we?

85
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,100
Now?

86
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,667
Now.

87
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,167
See you on the rooftop.

88
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,467
You

89
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,467
can be friends with me?

90
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,067
You can't, right?

91
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,300
Yes, I can.

92
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,333
No, just imagine if you
thought of me as a friend.

93
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,867
Why would you have hidden
me when your father came?

94
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,533
You could just say we ate ice cream together.

95
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,633
For fear of being misunderstood.

96
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,267
Okay, let's say that's the case.

97
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:45,800
But you and I can't be friends, we even kissed.

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,367
So what if we kissed once,
does that make us something?

99
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,600
- How old-fashioned.
- To say it's nothing even after a kiss?

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,300
You were the one who kissed, not me.

101
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,342
You liked it too, didn't you?

102
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,200
You clung to it, saying it was good,
and even embraced me.

103
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,567
What? Then what is that?

104
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,191
I don't remember.

105
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,133
You don't remember?

106
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,725
So, do you remember everything
every time you do it?

107
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,358
Every time?

108
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,620
You must have done it a lot, huh?

109
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:11,485
Of course.

110
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,667
Don't tell me you haven't
done it once since then.

111
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,667
That time?

112
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,667
You remember that.

113
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,367
Honestly,

114
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:37,448
if I had known you'd leave me,
I wouldn't have slept with you then.

115
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,300
Kang Hee,

116
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,900
was it nothing to you?

117
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,833
To me, it's a memory
I'll cherish for a lifetime.

118
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,700
Was it so insignificant and trivial to you?

119
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,725
Who said it was nothing?

120
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:55,892
It was my first time too.

121
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,537
But what about it, what now? Coming to this.

122
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,467
Once the construction is over,
I'll leave Hana-eup.

123
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,067
And you'll live in this godforsaken
place for the rest of your life.

124
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,293
I can go now.

125
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,718
If you're fine with it,
I can follow you anywhere.

126
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,143
I've told you so many times.

127
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,776
But you didn't come.

128
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
After agreeing to go to Seoul with me,

129
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,133
you made me go alone.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
Yes.

131
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,233
I'm sorry for that.

132
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,867
Because I regretted that,

133
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
I kept trying to come to you.

134
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,000
But you cut off contact first
and pushed me away.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't you think about my efforts?

136
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:50,233
Every time I barely reached out to you,
you pushed me off the cliff.

137
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,233
Let's stop this.

138
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,267
It's all in the past.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,433
It's all bothersome.

140
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,633
Okay.

141
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's stop this.

142
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,900
[Motel California]

143
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,300
Cheon Yeon Soo!

144
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,300
Ma'am, I need to wait, right?

145
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,367
Yes, please wait a moment.

146
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,200
Huh? Unnie!

147
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,833
Ms. Nan Woo.

148
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,867
Director.

149
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,233
How can you and Esther

150
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,300
manage to still be friends?

151
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,500
Is this a situation of jealousy now?
That kind of scenario?

152
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,167
I'm really just curious.

153
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,500
How can a man and a woman
stay friends all their lives?

154
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,833
How do you do that?

155
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,433
Was there never a crisis?

156
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:00,133
- A crisis?
- Like, you both

157
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,867
seeing each other as
the opposite sex, for example?

158
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:04,933
Wow! Yes!

159
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,167
Kang Hee is finally starting
to be curious about me.

160
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
No, that's not it…

161
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,100
Ugh, never mind, pretend you didn't hear it.

162
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:18,333
It's something that can be misunderstood, but,

163
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,767
we're just real friends.

164
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,333
- Let's make it 45 millimeters.
- Yes.

165
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,900
You placed the order for Remadil, right?

166
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,000
Ah, yes, I've checked it.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,067
Next.

168
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,800
And…

169
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,233
Huh? Unnie?

170
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:46,267
I felt cold while passing by.
Can I have a cup of tea before I go?

171
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,533
Oh, of course! Chamomile, right?

172
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,533
Yes.

173
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,467
You'll have some too, right, boss?

174
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,500
Drink it and go.

175
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,067
Boss, where are you going?

176
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,167
Veterinary visit.

177
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,100
Where's the visit to?

178
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,967
There were no reservations today.

179
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:35,667
He left his scarf behind. He'll be cold.

180
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,933
Come with me to the rooftop.

181
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,333
What is this from you?

182
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,967
Why are you giving this back to me again?

183
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,433
Are you disregarding someone's sincerity?

184
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,433
Give it to your boyfriend.

185
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,333
Stop right there.

186
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,667
If you don't accept this now, it's the end.

187
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,200
I won't be friends.

188
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,633
We're already over, aren't we?

189
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:41,733
Wasn't it the end from the time
you dumped me at the hotel?

190
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,400
Are you taking revenge on me right now?

191
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,233
Drink this and go back.

192
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,867
Drink it and go.

193
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,733
I sent you a purple message.
You gave me chamomile and just left.

194
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:59,467
Give it to your girlfriend later.

195
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,833
You're just mirroring the same words
I said when I gave you the necklace.

196
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,800
Think whatever you want.

197
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,867
It's childish. So childish.
Haven't you grown up at all?

198
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,167
Is it all about growing tall?

199
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,500
What about your heart not growing at all?

200
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,600
You weren't this childish
even when you were younger.

201
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,133
You understood and accepted everything I did.

202
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,533
Mirroring.

203
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,600
Wow!

204
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,700
Why is he like that, really?

205
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,600
Manager.

206
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,200
Yes, I'm coming.

207
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,867
Isn't it a bit different?

208
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,533
This wall has a different size
from the blueprint?

209
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,433
Manager.

210
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,067
I'm coming.

211
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:52,067
The angle of this handrail doesn't
match the original design.

212
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,333
Manager.

213
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,333
Almost there.

214
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,767
We need to select the electrical team
before our team can enter.

215
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,200
Ah, my hands are shaking.

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Manager, manager come out, over.

217
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,300
- Yes?
- To the first floor.

218
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,567
Ms. Nan Woo called.

219
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:32,467
Unnie, a donkey is coming to our hospital.

220
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,667
We need to build a house urgently.

221
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,633
Could you help us?

222
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,267
Tsk!

223
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,267
Did Yeon Soo send you

224
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:43,367
to ask me?

225
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,467
The director went to pick up the donkey.

226
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:50,133
I'm just asking you for a favor.

227
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,400
Director.

228
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,000
I heard you were building
a house for the donkey.

229
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Can you do it alone?

230
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,767
Really. What do you think
a large animal veterinarian is?

231
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,167
Building houses for migratory birds and
enclosures for wild animals is our specialty.

232
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,500
I'll help you.

233
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,900
It's okay.

234
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,067
[Hana Veterinary Clinic Parking Lot]

235
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,833
Many hands make light work.

236
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,467
You know, they say, practice makes perfect.

237
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:22,267
Contrary to what I thought,
I'm accustomed to the construction site.

238
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,200
Perhaps it would be better without my help?

239
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,433
No, what's this about your major
being building houses for wild animals?

240
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:00,067
Did you build an anthill or something?

241
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:03,933
And you said you were used to the site's meals,
so it seems that's all you've had.

242
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:07,200
Besides, people can't build anthills.

243
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,967
Huh? Unnie!

244
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,567
What are you two doing right now?

245
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,300
They've been like that since earlier,
I wonder if they will end it today.

246
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,633
Wait, did you cut that in the right size?

247
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,133
Hold on.

248
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,200
Did you cut this the wrong size?

249
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,767
We're already short on wood.
What can we do if you mess it up like this?

250
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,967
You're really not helping.

251
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,333
No, there is plenty of wood.

252
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,867
Cheon Yeon Soo,

253
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:43,467
you're going to build a fence, right?

254
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,667
Let's go to the site together
to load materials.

255
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,200
Never mind, it's late.

256
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,133
If Kang Hee does it, it'll be
done quickly. Come with me.

257
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,267
You can't just let anyone
into the construction site.

258
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:55,533
Car keys.

259
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,433
- Hurry up and give it to me.
- Hurry!

260
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,933
Please load this into the car.

261
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,833
- This one?
- Yes.

262
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,567
I'll do it. Load this up, please.

263
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,067
Please install this here.

264
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,233
Can you install this for me?

265
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,967
Now, everyone.

266
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,000
It's completed.

267
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
Wow!

268
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:05,333
Can a designer do this kind of work too?

269
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,467
You really made it well!

270
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,800
You learned it separately
by going to the field, right?

271
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Because I want to build my own house.

272
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,367
You mean, building the house yourself?

273
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:17,933
Laying bricks, making window
frames, and even tiling.

274
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,967
Cheon Yeon Soo,

275
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,167
there's a room for you too.

276
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,000
You asked me to make it.

277
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,067
My room?

278
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,800
Guest room.

279
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:34,633
Bring your wife and kids over
to hang out or something.

280
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,167
We'll see,

281
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,700
if the kids and wife say they are going.

282
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,167
You've worked hard.

283
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:52,333
Do you want to eat?
I don't want to be indebted.

284
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,100
What should I do?

285
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,800
I have a dinner appointment.

286
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,633
Ah, that's right. We also made plans
with Han Woo, didn't we?

287
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,533
Ah, yes.

288
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,267
That's too bad.

289
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,933
What should I do?

290
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,833
I have a dinner appointment.

291
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,533
Esther has already arrived?

292
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,567
How did you know?

293
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,733
It seems you have something to say to her.

294
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:26,967
Have a good meeting.

295
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,733
Shall we go together?

296
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,733
I'll pass today. You two can meet.

297
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:35,800
Aren't you jealous, not a bit?
I'm meeting another woman.

298
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,200
I'll be next time. I'm too tired today.

299
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,067
You promised. Be sure to be jealous next time.

300
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,867
Just like I did earlier.

301
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,233
Why did you say you want
to build your own house?

302
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,933
He doesn't even remember.

303
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,267
Really…

304
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,700
Oh my, is it already finished?

305
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,333
I came in a hurry to help.

306
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,667
Kang Hee.

307
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,500
I thought it was the work of a professional.

308
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,633
- Oh, what is it?
- Hey!

309
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:10,600
Stay away, it's dangerous, don't touch it.

310
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,600
It's a skin disease.

311
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,833
We can't let it spread to the cows, can we?

312
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,733
Ah, that's right.

313
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,767
Oh dear, but it's smaller than I thought.

314
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:25,433
The crossbreed is usually small, but this one
is smaller, because it couldn't eat properly.

315
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,467
They said it was abandoned
by the farm owner, right?

316
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,233
After it's fully treated,
does it have a place to go?

317
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,300
Shh!

318
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,500
I heard

319
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,767
if we say we're sending away an abandoned
one, it will get anxious, won't it?

320
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:42,100
Then, what's its name?

321
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,267
It doesn't have one yet.

322
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,133
Its name should be given by the owner later.

323
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,867
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

324
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:52,600
I have no ideas.

325
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,233
Thank you.

326
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,900
Why is he like that again?

327
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,967
Kang Hee, let's go!

328
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,533
Cheon Yeon Soo, come out!

329
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,833
I know you didn't go.

330
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,967
You draw too.

331
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:37,433
Can I come in too?

332
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,400
Yes, come in.

333
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,400
I wish I had my own room.

334
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,500
Your house has many rooms.

335
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,033
Not that kind of room.

336
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:58,800
When I grow up, I'm going
to live in a house like this.

337
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,100
With a room, a living room,

338
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,600
a kitchen, and even a yard.

339
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,933
I'll build it for you.

340
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:10,167
No, I'll build it.

341
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,767
You said you'll become a veterinarian.

342
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:24,933
When our cat gets sick,
you'll have to treat it.

343
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,567
Then what about me?

344
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,167
Can I come over to your house?

345
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:40,567
I'll make a room for you too.

346
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:43,567
Thank you.

347
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:46,400
Fool, teddy bear.

348
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,400
There were times when I was
happy because of a friend.

349
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:59,800
Back then, a friend was all I needed.

350
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,700
And it was nice not having to confess.

351
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:13,767
It's good because we won't have to part ways,

352
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,033
and because we can see each other for life.

353
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:42,867
That's… because it's unrequited love, right?

354
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,833
No.

355
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,333
It's good because we're friends.

356
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,900
Excuse me.

357
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,667
- It's your first time at a place like this, right?
- Yeah.

358
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,267
Where shall we sit?

359
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,600
Do you come to places like this often?

360
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,233
Yes.

361
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,300
What's fresh today?

362
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,500
The sea squirts are fresh,
and we've got spoon worms too.

363
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,000
Great! We'll take the sea squirts
and spoon worms.

364
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,167
Do you have live octopus?
And some octopus and tartare too.

365
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:16,867
And the drinks?

366
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,433
Later.

367
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,467
Is this it? The spoon worms?

368
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,900
Are we supposed to eat this?

369
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,767
- Do we eat this?
- Huh?

370
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,000
Wow!

371
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,167
- You try it first.
- What?

372
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,567
I eat it all the time, you have some more.

373
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,800
This one?

374
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,033
Spit it out.

375
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,667
It's so delicious!

376
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,767
You try it too.

377
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,400
No, you have more.

378
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,300
- Eat it, quick.
- No, I'm fine.

379
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,300
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

380
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,867
It's your turn now.

381
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,600
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean?

382
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,033
How long have I known you?
Can't I tell just by looking at you?

383
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,133
What?

384
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,800
Is Victor causing you trouble?

385
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,533
We

386
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:41,800
are negotiating with "Fire Ball".
I didn't actually tell Victor, you know?

387
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,900
Is that why he's upset?

388
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,033
"Lyon" is transferring his shares.

389
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:48,167
Hey, not "Lyon". It means a hostile M&A.

390
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,967
Exactly.

391
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,967
If we combine our shares,
we can defend it, it's okay.

392
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,767
Don't tell me you've
transferred your shares too?

393
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm going to sue.

394
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,233
They proceeded without asking my opinion
or consent, so I can definitely reclaim it.

395
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,967
I felt I should tell you before you heard it
from Lawyer Kim. That's all.

396
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,500
Esther,

397
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,433
this is nothing, you know that, right?

398
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,900
If needed, I can give you all my shares.

399
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,833
But let me ask you one thing.

400
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,967
Are you happy? With Victor?

401
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:25,533
I don't want you to suffer
a loss because of me.

402
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You didn't answer.

403
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,900
I'm asking if you're happy.

404
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,933
Who is this woman?

405
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,433
Does Kang Hee know? That you two are meeting?

406
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,500
Are you by any chance Cheon Yeon Soo?

407
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,133
Yes. Who are you?

408
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,767
I've heard a lot about you from Seok Kyeong.

409
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,933
No, why talk about me…

410
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,767
Ah, I don't do blind dates.

411
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:04,967
I don't do blind dates.

412
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,067
I don't do them either.

413
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,167
No, I can't.

414
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,933
I'm also married

415
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,300
and pregnant.

416
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:19,133
Really?

417
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,600
Is it true?

418
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,133
Yes.

419
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,633
What, you're not going to congratulate me?

420
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,333
Congratulations.

421
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,833
Congratulations!

422
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,533
Thank you!

423
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:36,033
Esther, are you really becoming a mother?

424
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:39,567
I wanted to tell my best friend first.

425
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,400
But you heard it too.

426
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,367
Congratulations to you.

427
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,500
So, you two…

428
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,233
We are friends.

429
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,667
We also work together.

430
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,433
Well…

431
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,400
I'm also really close with Kang Hee.

432
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,433
Here.

433
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,467
[Team Leader Park Esther]

434
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,333
"Park" of Golden Gilt Studio.

435
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,433
Park Esther.

436
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,767
"Hwang" is the boss, "Geum" is…

437
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,700
"Ji" is Kang Hee.

438
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,700
Hence, Golden Gilt.
[*Pronounced Hwang-Geum-Park-Ji]

439
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,433
I'll go first.

440
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,867
It was nice to meet you. See you next time.

441
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,167
Let's go together.

442
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,767
Nonsense.

443
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,567
It's fine.

444
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,767
Call me when you arrive.

445
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Please, go.

446
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,667
Since when have you two been friends?

447
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,333
If you're curious, let's
have another drink together.

448
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:07,367
I haven't tried living in the countryside,

449
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,067
but it's fun.

450
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,300
Why?

451
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,700
Because of Kang Hee.

452
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,300
Everything is fun when done with Kang Hee.

453
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,700
It's all fun.

454
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,433
I suppose so.

455
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,100
What man in the world?

456
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,700
What man wouldn't like Kang Hee?

457
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,367
What?

458
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,233
That's different.

459
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:34,733
I will do everything Kang Hee asks me.

460
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:37,700
I'll do anything Kang Hee wants.

461
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,433
Oh. I…

462
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:44,733
Who can't be nice when they are by your side?

463
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,200
Even when not beside you,

464
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,200
always thinking of you and being nice,
that's what truly being nice is.

465
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,767
Have you been to Jogye Temple in Seoul?

466
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,400
How about Bongeun Temple?

467
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
As for me,

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,667
when I go there, I'm the person who
always lights a candle for Kang Hee's health.

469
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,967
Or maybe…

470
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:09,500
Myeongdong Cathedral!
When I go to Myeongdong Cathedral,

471
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,033
I pray for Kang Hee's happiness too.

472
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:16,267
I'm the person who visits each church
to make offerings, that's me.

473
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:19,600
No, why would Kang Hee's happiness

474
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,858
be outsourced to Buddha, Virgin Mary, or God?

475
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:26,625
I am

476
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:31,233
going to make her happy myself.

477
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:34,433
What do you know about Kang
Hee to make her happy?

478
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,833
You shouldn't know about Kang Hee,

479
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,033
because Kang Hee dislikes men
who know her past.

480
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:45,467
So, Cheon Yeon Soo

481
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:48,167
is out of the game.

482
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,500
I

483
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,167
have known Kang Hee since we were young, but

484
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,733
do you know how many years it's been since
Kang Hee went to Seoul and I haven't seen her?

485
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,133
Even I don't know Kang Hee.

486
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,233
I don't know.

487
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:06,067
You think I know, but I don't.

488
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:10,133
So with that in mind, I say I win. Me!

489
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,467
Let's wait and see who wins.

490
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,867
Hey! Han Woo, why?

491
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,133
Who is it?

492
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,133
- My friend…
- Hello?

493
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,900
- What are you doing?
- Who's this?

494
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,567
I said, my friend, Han Woo.

495
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:27,800
Hey, I'm busy, talk later.

496
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:29,933
Isn't that a woman?

497
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,533
Seems like you're talking
to another woman right now?

498
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,433
A man! Obviously a man!

499
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:36,100
It was clearly a woman just now!

500
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,267
I am speechless.

501
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,700
Good morning!

502
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,067
Good morning!

503
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,233
- Good morning.
- Oh, uh?

504
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:47,167
What about Director Geum?

505
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,100
Hasn't he come yet?

506
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,233
No, he's not answering the phone.

507
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,900
I will try it.

508
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,233
- Ah, what?
- What!

509
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:31,100
- What?
- What is this?

510
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,000
What's this? What's this?

511
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,600
Why are you here, Mr. Cheon Yeon Soo?

512
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Who should be asking that?

513
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,933
Yesterday, we definitely met by chance,
greeted each other and parted.

514
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,267
It wasn't that. We had a drink together.

515
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,867
I must have made no mistake.

516
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,267
I know, I know.

517
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,400
And I haven't made any mistakes either.

518
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,600
That…

519
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,633
I can't remember what we did
yesterday at all. Or what was said.

520
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,900
I completely blanked out too.

521
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,200
Why am I the only one undressed?

522
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,600
I will properly confess to Ms. Kang Hee.

523
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,900
That I can do anything with her.

524
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,033
So,

525
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:16,833
keep being Yeon Soo the friend,

526
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:20,533
and watch from the sidelines.

527
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,033
So, brother,

528
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,467
the conclusion is,

529
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:30,167
the person who will be with
Kang Hee for life is me.

530
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:34,500
If you and her date and then break up,

531
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,467
you become strangers. The end, it's over.

532
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,833
So after all is said and done,
money is the best…

533
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:46,567
Sworn friends are the best, okay?

534
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,133
I remember now.

535
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,067
You are Kang Hee's

536
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:55,567
sworn friend, right?

537

Another person?

553
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:52,333
It was clearly the director's phone.

554
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:55,100
"This is Geum Seok Kyeong."
That's what they say.

555

You said you were coming for advice,

It wasn't just a bouquet,
there were also concert tickets.

But he recently gave up on that.

You just have to kick it and it's a goal.

when it comes to marriage.

718
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,700
Why are you going to Seoul?

719
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:48,467
Just have some things to sort out, and you?

720
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,033
My home has always been in Seoul.

721
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:52,967
And my company is also in Seoul.

722
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:00,033
How's life in Seoul?

723
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:03,400
Right now, well… it's good.

724
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:06,367
Because of that guy?

725
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:10,600
Until I joined this company, it was really…

726
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,867
What, how was it?

727
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:15,200
It was like cursed hardtack.

728
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,400
Hardtack?

729
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,200
Yeah.

730
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,300
Do you remember the hardtack man?

731
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:22,833
Yes, I remember.

00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:28,800
[The hardtack of those old days]

733
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,567
We used to worry about it all the time.

734
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:35,700
Worried the hardtack would get
moist during the rainy season.

735
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,100
Worried it would collect dust
during the sand storm season.

736
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,300
Worried it wouldn't sell in the midsummer.

737
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,800
And then worried in the dead of winter
that the man's hands would be cold.

738
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:53,333
Life in Seoul is like that.

739
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Like rainy season hardtack,

740
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,433
like summer hardtack, like winter hardtack.

741
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,367
What does it matter, among friends?

742
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,567
No, I didn't sleep.

743
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:49,600
You slept!

744
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,567
Thought you were headbanging.

745
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:55,367
Yeah, I slept.

746
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,800
I owe you one.

747
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,633
What? Should I compensate you?

748
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
Sure.

749
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,867
With what?

750
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,600
A tour of Seoul.

751
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,367
Please, do it for me.

752
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:13,800
Ma'am, please come down carefully.

753
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:18,667
- Over here!
- Oh dear, thank you.

754
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,000
Not at all. Please go inside carefully.

755
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:26,833
Is there a place you want to visit?

756
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:28,233
Golden Gilt.

757
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,333
Our company?

758
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,467
Why there?

759
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,067
You said you have to go to the company anyway.

760
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:36,733
That's me, but you should go
where you want to visit.

761
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,533
I'm curious about how my friend works.

762
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,500
Is that not possible?

763
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,100
Alright, let's go.

764
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,300
But,

765
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,400
can friends take the subway together?

766
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,067
Do what's comfortable. Shall
we part here and meet again later?

767
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,733
It's fine.

768
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:04,100
The subway in Seoul is incredibly complicated.

769
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,233
Just follow me closely.

770
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,133
- Why aren't you coming?
- It's convenient to transfer here.

771
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:13,667

Did you wait long?

774
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:34,500
So this is where my friend works.

775
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,033
You should have waited in the
coffee shop on the first floor.

776
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:40,633
It was fun watching people.

777
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:45,467
Ah, I'm hungry.

778
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:47,100
Shall we eat?

779
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:50,433
Is it okay to eat alone with a friend?

780
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:52,633
Then, should we eat separately?

781
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:54,767
Let's eat and then meet up again.

782
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,133
Hold this for me, please.

783
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:31,067
No, I can't.

784
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,233
What?

Don't you know the perilla leaf debate?

But both of you have the same opinion.

So, it's not possible.

790
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:48,033
You…

791
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:51,700
Are you more afraid of Han Woo?
Or are you more afraid of me?

792
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:20,933
Hey, between friends, can you debone the fi…
