1
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:28,360


2
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,470
   

3
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,920
Ah! You scared me!

4
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,430
 Ice cream? 

5
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,269
You don't usually eat ice cream.

6
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,269
There's someone I need to buy it for.

7
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:05,702
Someone? I just caught you red-handed.

8
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:06,869
Who is it?

9
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,202
Then, will you buy me one, too?

10
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,602
I like ice cream, too.

11
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:13,602
All right, then.

12
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:16,769
Yay! Ice cream!

13
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,836
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

14
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:20,136
Wow! That looks delicious!

15
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:22,136
Director, what would you like to have?

16
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:27,036
- I'll take one of these in the family size. 
 - Yes.

17
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,836
This one?

18
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,036
A provocative flavor?

19
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,969
What's gotten into you?

20
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,269
Hm, which flavor should I pick?

21
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:56,802
 I really can't live like this. 

22
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,100
 What a waste of a fine-looking person. 

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,202
 Live your life straight. 

24
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:05,336
 Let go! Who do you think you are? Who are you? 

25
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:07,380
 I'm the wife of the man you took to a motel! 

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,170
 What are you going to do about it? 

27
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:11,702
 You're dead! 

28
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,536
 Let go! 

29
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,336
 Hey, leave! Take your husband and go! 

30
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,402
 You scammer, go away! 

31
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:20,936
 It hurts, really! 

32
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:22,802
 Love isn't a crime, is it? 

33
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:25,236
 What are you saying? You! 

34
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,736
 Please stop! Yes. Okay! 

35
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:46,136
 Kang Hee, shall we go for ice cream? 

36
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,736
 Can I have a double? 

37
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:53,702
 No, you can have a double-double. 

38
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:56,036
 Then I'll have Shooting Star. 

39
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,502
 I'll take mint chocolate chip. 

40
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:00,902
 One is… 

41
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:02,602
 Chocolate? 

42
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,202
 Walnut? 

43
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:07,469
 Oh, I can't choose. 

44
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:12,169
 Then, choose four flavors you'd like to have. 

45
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:16,669
 But you always pick mint chocolate chip. 

46
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:19,602
 - It's okay. 
 - Dummy. 

47
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,336
 Forget it. 

48
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,602
 I'll take walnut. 

49
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:26,336
 And you? 

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,302
 I'll have two mint chocolate chips. 

51
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:45,136
 Don't eat ice cream with anyone else. 

52
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:47,602
 But after soccer, I always eat with the guys. 

53
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,236
 Not like that. 

54
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,802
 Only eat the Berry Scoop with me. 

55
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:54,236
 Then you, too, only eat with me. 

56
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,802
 You promise first. 

57
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,536
 No. If I promise first, then you won't promise. 

58
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,536
 Ah, come on! 

59
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,936
 Hurry! 

60
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,469
 Ugh. 

61
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,669
 It's a promise! 

62
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,036
This one is good, and that's good too.

63
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,502
I'll have the chocolate flavor, please.

64
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:20,202
Okay, I'll help you with the payment first.

65
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:22,736
- Please wrap it separately. 
 - Yes.

66
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,069
Bad guy.

67
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,002
You punk.

68
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,269
 Okay. 

69
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,936
 From now on, whether it be regular ice cream or the Berry Scoop, 

70
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:49,136
 I'll eat it only with you. 

71
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,036
 - Okay. 
 - Is that settled? 

72
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,769
 Yeah. 

73
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:58,802
 - You play soccer? 
 - Yeah. 

74
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,836
 The kids let me be the goalkeeper. 

75
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:08,302
You punk.

76
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:13,069
Who's the punk you're talking about?

77
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:34,869
 You will look at someone else with those eyes. 

78
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,802
 You will call someone else with that voice. 

79
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,936
 You will hold someone else in your heart. 

80
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:50,669
Kang Hee, why are you crying?

81
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:53,836
You changed.

82
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:57,336
You changed a lot.

83
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,169
Kang Hee.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,030
♫  It's for only you.  ♫

85
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:09,236
Don't follow me.

86
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:19,720
♫  For you, with a soft heart  ♫

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,810
♫  I love you too much to lose you  ♫

88
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,950
♫  I hide my complicated thoughts and confess to you  ♫

89
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,640
♫  It has to be you  ♫

90
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:47,610
♫  There's so much more I want to do for you  ♫

91
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,360
♫  I want to make sure I tell you  ♫

92
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,869
I know you're there.

93
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,350
♫  It has to be you  ♫

94
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,200
♫  I was naive and hurt you before  ♫

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,100
♫  I must be an idiot  ♫

96
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,836
♫  Even if I may burden you  ♫

97
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:26,002
You saw it.

98
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:28,702
You saw me crying.

99
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:33,569
How could he actually not follow me because I told him not to?

100
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,569
Clueless teddy bear.

101
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,669
 Kang Hee. 

102
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,702
 Hey, Ji Kang Hee. 

103
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,736
 If you go now, I won't wait anymore. 

104
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,169
 That's what I've been hoping for. 

105
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,836
 Our first love ends here. 

106
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,602
 The end. 

107
00:07:58,502 --> 00:08:00,602
 Are you serious? 

108
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:03,636
 Thank you for liking me all this time. 

109
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,770
♫  I won't forget you  ♫

110
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:23,430
♫  Don't leave, please stay by my side  ♫

111
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,202
First love, the end.

112
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:30,502
Serves you right for acting all high and mighty, Ji Kang Hee.

113
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:35,002
You're the one who said it's over. Why are you crying?

114
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,702
I told you not to follow me.

115
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:47,502
Go!

116
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,069
It's expensive, a limited edition.

117
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,836
"Make sure you return it".

118
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,702
I was going to say that, but it suits you well.

119
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:16,669
It's not easy to find someone that suits this better than me.

120
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,402
You can have it, Kang Hee.

121
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,136
- Can you see well? 
 - No, I can't see.

122
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,869
Let's go together.

123
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:38,302
What? You can see properly.

124
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,269
 Don't follow me. 

125
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,502
Please make sure to only give this to Kang Hee.

126
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,636
Kkam Hee,

127
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:17,836
Kang Hee used to be someone only I could console.

128
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,269
But not anymore.

129
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:28,902
Why do you think Kang Hee cried?

130
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,069
You're asking if I asked?

131
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,436
She said I changed, a lot.

132
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,669
I'm still the same though.

133
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,969
What exactly has changed?

134
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:55,169
What? Cheon Yeon Soo, you were in your room?

135
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,702
Hey, put this on and follow me to the rooftop.

136
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,169
What is all this?

137
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,802
Ah, I don't know. Mr. Chun Pil

138
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:06,102
wanted us to wear one each and then gather on the rooftop.

139
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,136
Today is a bit…

140
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:11,202
It's Kang Hee's welcome party. Are you planning to skip it?

141
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:15,069
You know how he really likes welcome or launch ceremonies, all that stuff.

142
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,802
He was saying we should match, all together as a family.

143
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:22,302
Ah Reum grabbed the opportunity and even had uniforms made.

144
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:24,102
So, now it has come to this.

145
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:25,636
Let's ride along with it, okay?

146
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:28,902
Pretend like we worked hard on it, you know the vibe?

147
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:32,169
Come on. You'll end up being the most enthusiastic once you're there.

148
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,936
Come up.

149
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,202
What about the carpet?

150
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,669
What carpet?

151
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,702
A red carpet.

152
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,536
Why aren't you asking?

153
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,236
Can I ask?

154
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:53,969
There's no guarantee of an answer, though.

155
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:56,036
No, I need to hear it.

156
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,369
It's a very important issue to me.

157
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,569
What is it?

158
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,836
From today onwards, we...

159
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,602
don't have to look for accommodations. Right?

160
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,636
We'll be staying at Motel California.

161
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:12,869
Was that what you were going to ask?

162
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,236
Yes, why?

163
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,469
Things like "Why did you cry?"

164
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:21,102
"Why didn't you tell me Motel California is your home?"

165
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:24,136
"Why did you say your perfectly living father had passed away?"

166
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:27,002
"Why do you call him Chun Pil?"

167
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,736
You thought that's what I would ask about?

168
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:34,669
Why would I ask you about things you don't want to talk about?

169
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:37,402
I'll find out on my own.

170
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,636
The moment you find out, you'll distance yourself from me.

171
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:49,169
Because I hate men who know my past.

172
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,102
That's right.

173
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,302
How did you get here?

174
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,869
No, nothing happened.

175
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,636
- Nothing at all? 
 - No incidents or accidents.

176
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,136
Hey, Ji Kang Hee.

177
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,902
When did you arrive that I'm only seeing your face now?

178
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:14,336
Kang Hee, get behind me.

179
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,602
Ms. Ji Kang Hee needs to rest today due to her heavy workload,

180
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,936
so please come back another time.

181
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,502
What heavy workload?

182
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:23,169
You were going on about interior design.

183
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,169
Are you really the heir to the Elitree Hotel?

184
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:30,602
I've seen it all, a Seoul man escorting manual laborers at construction sites.

185
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,736
- It's not manual labor, it's the supervisor. 
 - Then…

186
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:35,369
Let's take the questions one at a time, please.

187
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:36,836
Starting with me.

188
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:38,569
What do you mean by gangster?

189
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,902
Why do you call Kang Hee's friends gangsters?

190
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:44,436
- Thank you. 
 - Please come in.

191
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,969
I'm back.

192
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:47,636
Kang Hee.

193
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,702
Everyone is waiting.

194
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,836
For me?

195
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,136
Who?

196
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:00,536
   

197
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:02,536
Wow! There's really a lot of beer.

198
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:04,436
Hey!

199
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:06,069
Should I help you?

200
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:07,936
Let's get ready, now.

201
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:09,802
I hope Kang Hee likes it.

202
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:12,769
Ah Reum and Seung Eon stand over there.

203
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,036
Come here.

204
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,136
Here.

205
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,436
Hey, but shouldn't that guy also be here?

206
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:18,736
   

207
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:19,969
     

208
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:22,436
Maybe not? Right?

209
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:24,002
Because it's Kang Hee's house.

210
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,636
Pose.

211
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,269
Ah, what is it?

212
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:36,402
Let's go together, Ms. Kang Hee.

213
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:39,836
Who are you?

214
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,602
I'm Kwon.

215
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,402
Well… Not just the surname, full name, please.

216
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:49,002
It is Mr. Kwon.

217
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:51,936
Mr. Kwon.

218
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,202
I'd like my room on an upper floor as well, please.

219
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,436
It's the family floor.

220
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:02,302
It seems you don't know, but I'm practically family, too.

221
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,869
Kang Hee and I are like a family eating from the same pot. Okay?

222
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,802
Your family members…

223
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,002
Manager!

224
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:19,400
Let's go out and buy some food,

225
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,336
as we are family who share meals.

226
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,502
I'll give you my card.

227
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:23,702
No. No need!

228
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:26,502
- Manager! 
 - Let's go out to eat. Let's go out.

229
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:27,769
Mr. Manager!

230
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,469
What's with this sweater?

231
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,069
Huh? Sweater?

232
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:34,036
Your cronies call this a team uniform.

233
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:36,002
They put it together and gave one to me, too.

234
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,669
Go upstairs and look. All your cronies are gathered there.

235
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,836
   

236
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,002
   

237
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:57,469
   

238
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:59,136
What is this? 
    

239
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:03,469
Congratulations on your comeback to Hana-eup, Ji Kang Hee!

240
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:06,269
Hey, you've got it reversed!

241
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:09,502
- Hey, you should have told me! 
- It's ruined.

242
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,702
You are "Kang" and I am "Hee".

243
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:13,169
If Mr. Chun Pil had come too, it would've been "Hee Kang Ji"!

244
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:17,002
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

245
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:25,102
Shall we get started on eating, now?

246
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,502
What is that?

247
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,236
This?

248
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,802
Do you want to try this?

249
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:36,136
It's the famous Sriracha sauce from Thailand.

250
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,169
The spiciness is delicious.

251
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,002
- It's good? 
 - Yes.

252
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:25,669
 It says "son of a dog, son of a dog". 

253
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,236
   

254
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:32,236
   

255
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,936
 If you bully Cheon Yeon Soo 

256
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:43,769
 whoever it is, I will pay back the same way. 

257
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,402
 Got it? 

258
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,002
 One, two, faster! One, two, one, two. 

259
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:56,336
 Faster! One, two, one, two. 

260
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:57,969
 Hold on. 

261
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,002
 Why do I have to do this? 

262
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,736
 There's no such thing as a free lunch in this world. 

263
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,102
 I saved you, didn't I? 

264
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,936
 I don't know, I can't anymore. 

265
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:12,602
 Cheon Yeon Soo! Cheon Yeon Soo! 

266
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:23,236
 Cheon Yeon Soo, well done. 

267
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,169
 Cheon Yeon Soo! Cheon… 

268
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,269
 Again! 

269
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,069
 Can't go home today until it's done. 

270
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:48,420
 Good job! That's right! 

271
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,280
As expected, I was right. Well done!

272
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,136
 Number 1. 

273
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:55,102
 - Number 2. 
 - Number 3. 

274
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,302
 Number 4. 

275
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,036
 - Fighting! 
 - Fighting! 

276
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:02,336
 - Win, Kang Hee team! 
 - Win, Heon Yeol team! 

277
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:15,002
 Kang Hee team, win! 

278
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:18,369
 Kang Hee team, lose! 

279
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:22,336
 - Heon Yeol team, win! 
 - Cheon Yeon Soo, come quickly! 

280
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:25,169
 Cheon Yeon Soo, quickly! 

281
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:46,102
 Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo! 

282
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,002
 Line up properly. 

283
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:50,269
 - Are you a gangster, too? 
 - Not really. 

284
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,536
 What do you mean you're not? 

285
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:56,302
 Kang Hee's gang, they are gangsters. 

286
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,160
 It's not a gang! 

287
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,830
 We're a family! 

288
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,502
 Yeon Soo, we are going to eat red bean bread. 

289
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:07,236
 - Do you want to come with us? 
 - Yes. 

290
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:23,769
 To that treasure chest. The first person to get there is number one! 

291
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:28,002
 - First place! 
 - Second place! 

292
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,769
 Third place! 

293
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,202
 Hey, everyone, gather around. 

294
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:55,802
 Ah. 

295
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,669
 Is it that delicious? 

296
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:16,802
 Yes. 

297
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:18,736
 I want to do it too, gangster. 

298
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,002
 That's right, number 3. 

299
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,036
 Number 3? 

300
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,136
 I am number 1. 

301
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,802
 I am number 2. 

302
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:27,802
 Number 3 is the best for Cheon Yeon Soo. 

303
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:28,769
 Look. 

304
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,469
 Number one, three syllables. 

305
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:33,902
 Number two, three syllables. 

306
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:35,602
 Number three, 

307
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,536
 you are the only one with four syllables. 

308
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:39,269
 It's special. 

309
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,836
 Number three? 

310
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,602
 Right? 

311
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:53,850
Ah, garlic!

312
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,520
You guys...

313
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,610
This is so good!

314
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,369
Everyone has grown a lot.

315
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:01,902
What are you talking about?

316
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:04,302
He was always calling himself the boss.

317
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:05,936
Ah, I don't know. I can't remember.

318
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:08,636
And, these days, it's Cha Seung Eon who's the boss.

319
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:11,102
He's the one who earns the most money among us.

320
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:12,869
I heard he even gives allowance to your father.

321
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,702
What are you talking about?

322
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:18,102
Hanwoo cried while releasing the cows on his farm.

323
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:20,102
He really became a man, right?

324
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:21,850
Who says I cried?

325
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,430
I mean, it's not that I cried, so, well…

326
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:28,169
Now I finally realize why I'm called Han Woo!

327
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:29,936
I didn't cry.

328
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:32,569
Have some shrimp, too.

329
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:35,602
How did my dad decide to name me Han Woo?

330
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:41,069
Why did he name me that way?

331
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,469
Yeon Soo, how about you?

332
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,169
Are you doing well?

333
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:49,002
Is the hospital doing well?

334
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,402
Just…

335
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,102
It's fun.

336
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:56,920
I inherited the hospital from Grandpa, but there's also a sense of fulfillment.

337
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:01,236
You could say he's Hana-eup's top guy.

338
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,502
Just how many animals is Yeon Soo responsible for?

339
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,869
But Cheon Yeon Soo is really lucky.

340
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,302
You did your apprenticeship here, too.

341
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,802
Right?

342
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,769
How about you, Ah Reum?

343
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,669
Are you still writing poetry?

344
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:29,536
What does it matter? Everyone knows anyway.

345
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,102
Yeah, even when you used to work many jobs, pretending to be refined and writing poetry.

346
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:38,669
I wasn't pretending to be refined.

347
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,669
And you, Kang Hee? How have you been doing?

348
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,669
Me? Well…

349
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:57,736
Hey, I should get going. I'll leave first.

350
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,769
Hey, Kang Hee. Then, I'll go with you.

351
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,836
- I'll take you. 
 - No.

352
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:06,869
You need to clean up here.

353
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,569
This and that, clean it all. Right?

354
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:14,769
Ah, right. Then I'll tidy this up.

355
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:17,802
Hey, Han Woo, can you help Seung Eon a bit?

356
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:20,169
Let's go, Ah Reum. I'll take you.

357
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:23,469
- See you!  
 - Bye.

358
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:28,036
Leaving so abruptly...

359
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:51,336
Come on, Ah Reum! You left me out.

360
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:54,936
I'm sorry, Manager. I was invited, too.

361
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,510
Kang Hee, I'll go ahead with Yeon Soo.

362
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,836
You stay here.

363
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:00,450
Let's go.

364
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,469
I heard it was a welcome party for you.

365
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,402
Must have been nice.

366
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:10,502
Not at all.

367
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,302
I'm going for a walk.

368
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:30,102
Ah, it was not me, actually.

369
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:34,002
Good work!

370
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,669
Are you resenting me right now?

371
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:46,400
You came out following Kang Hee.

372
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Offering to take me home was an excuse.

373
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:53,402
Then did you do it on purpose, knowing that?

374
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,636
Kang Hee has Mr. Manager next to her now.

375
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:01,269
Once the construction is finished, she'll go back to Seoul.

376
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:07,269
If you get shaken, how can we just watch you struggle?

377
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,669
I have to do well on the construction.

378
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:18,236
All of a sudden? You are already doing well.

379
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:23,169
I ran away from here when I was 20 years old, you know?

380
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,736
I left for Seoul without a plan.

381
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:29,102
Moving from one exam prep room to another,

382
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:32,236
working two or three part-time jobs a day.

383
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:38,469
When I got my college diploma with my own effort,

384
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:41,310
although it was a community college,

385
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,230
I was happy to make it to first base.

386
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:50,502
After I got a job,

387
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:54,102
when I received a business card with "Ji Kang Hee" engraved on it,

388
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,902
I felt proud because it seemed like I had reached second base.

389
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:01,769
What I mean is,

390
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,736
I've lived diligently.

391
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:08,669
I know, I am the witness.

392
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:13,336
I've seen Ms. Kang Hee working part-time

393
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:15,902
and work passionately as a designer.

394
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:20,602
But seeing my childhood friends today,

395
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:28,036
I felt like I was the only loser.

396
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:32,402
Everyone seems to be living well here without any problems.

397
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,402
I was the one that couldn't bear it and ran away.

398
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:39,469
It wasn't running away, it was a challenge.

399
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,002
Maybe all your friends are envious, too. Right?

400
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:47,169
Otel Hana.

401
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:50,402
Renovate it magnificently, for all to see.

402
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,769
"I wasn't wrong."

403
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:57,602
"I am also living well and working hard."

404
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,136
I want to prove that.

405
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,502
Yes.

406
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:03,136
I'll let you do whatever you want to do.

407
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:05,236
We'll have a splendid opening ceremony on Christmas

408
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:08,102
and have a grand plaque unveiling as well.

409
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:11,536
Just call all the people from Hana-eup

410
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:13,502
and show them properly.

411
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:17,802
Ji Kang Hee, you've lived well!

412
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:22,202
You've lived well!

413
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:27,036
Ji Kang Hee, you've lived well!

414
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:30,802
Nice!

415
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,769
Yes, this is Hana Veterinary Clinic…

416
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:00,669
Yes, sir.

417
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,102
Yes.

418
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,902
What should I do? The director isn't here right now.

419
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:10,636
I'm not in charge of large animals,

420
00:29:10,636 --> 00:29:13,202
and I haven't done any field visits for treatment either.

421
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:17,136
Yes, I understand.

422
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,300
   

423
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:55,602
What's the matter? Where are you going?

424
00:29:55,602 --> 00:29:56,902
A veterinary emergency.

425
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:58,236
What about Cheon Yeon Soo?

426
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,640
He went to consult, too.

427
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,800
I left a message, but got no reply. It's an emergency, so…

428
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,002
Get off.

429
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:11,136
I'll drive. Let's take my car.

430
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:15,020
Okay.

431
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:19,636
   

432
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,769
Stay calm. You can do it.

433
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:43,869
Dr. Yoon, you're the one whom Cheon Yeon Soo trusted and selected.

434
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:49,069
I can do it!

435
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:52,969
When the director isn't here, I am his stand-in.

436
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,436
Let's go.

437
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:16,936
What about Yeon Soo?

438
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,636
Didn't Yeon Soo come?

439
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:20,536
Where is the cow?

440
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,636
It's gas bloating.

441
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,669
I'll insert a gastric tube to relieve it.

442
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,902
- Please open its mouth. 
 - Ah, yes.

443
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,269
It's not going in well because it's blocked near the throat.

444
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:44,069
Just a moment.

445
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,840
Chil Ddaeng, this is for you.

446
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,700
It'll make you feel better.

447
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:50,969
Even if it hurts, please bear with it a little.

448
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:55,002
- We need to puncture the stomach. 
 - What?

449
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,802
We'll make an incision and insert a trocar into the stomach to remove the gas.

450
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:00,336
We need to shave the hair and disinfect.

451
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,102
Han Woo, please help me.

452
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:03,736
No, absolutely not.

453
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:05,702
Excuse me, doctor. Have you performed surgery before?

454
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:08,560
Han Woo, we have to save Chil Ddaeng.

455
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,230
It's urgent.

456
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,302
Kang Hee, my father…

457
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,802
These guys! My poor cow! It's my cow!

458
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,169
My cow!

459
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:23,736
Even if it hurts, please bear with it a little.

460
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:26,269
Hang in there. You're doing well.

461
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,836
- My poor cow. 
 - Mister.

462
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:31,169
They are killing my cow!

463
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:33,202
Just listen to the cow's cries!

464
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,502
They are killing my Chil Ddaeng, right now!

465
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:38,169
Chil Ddaeng, just hold on a little!

466
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:42,402
You need to hold on tight.

467
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:44,402
I'm going to insert the trocar now.

468
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:46,236
- Sir. 
 - I'm inserting it.

469
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:50,102
- Quickly! 
 - One, two, three.

470
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,136
Chil Ddaeng!

471
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:02,136
Director, I did it.

472
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,869
Chil Ddaeng is okay now.

473
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:04,902
I did it.

474
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,669
Good job!

475
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:09,869
It must have been scary handling a large animal for the first time, but you managed to do it.

476
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:12,002
Congratulations on successfully completing your first surgery!

477
00:33:12,002 --> 00:33:15,202
Thank you so much for saving Chil Ddaeng.

478
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,036
You worked hard.

479
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:33,802
   

480
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:35,936
No way!

481
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:40,469
Where on earth have I been leaving my brain…

482
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:45,736
Vehicle traffic is completely controlled.

483
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:49,502
The festival venue is here because the judging venue is here.

484
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,869
Blocking off all vehicles. Is it like a World Cup street cheering event?

485
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,069
Ah, yes.

486
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:56,302
The countryside folks must be excited for it.

487
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:59,336
The day of concrete finish is the first festival day. 
    

488
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,702
The mixer truck can't get in. 
    

489
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:03,336
How many days will the festival last?

490
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,869
Four days.

491
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:08,002
Then let's just postpone our work.

492
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,302
Since it's the Hanwoo Beef Festival, let's enjoy the beef to our heart's content.

493
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:14,902
The weather is getting colder, so the concrete curing time gets longer.

494
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:19,836
If the finishing is delayed, the opening might be delayed by ten days or even half a month.

495
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:21,036
Is that all?

496
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:23,330
The contracts for the teams here are ending…

497
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,029
- What are you going to do after they end? 
 - With money?

498
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:28,836
Do you like it here that much, Manager?

499
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:33,136
I want to finish quickly and go back to Seoul as soon as possible.

500
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,669
   

501
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:52,236
Is Seoul really all that?

502
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,336
Or... how about asking Mr. Chun Pil for help?

503
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:01,302
He is on the festival preparation committee.

504
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:03,202
As if he would be much help.

505
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,469
That's settled, then.

506
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,536
Do you know Mr. Chun Pil?

507
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:09,636
Forget about Mr. Chun Pil.

508
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:11,769
Bring me the list of the festival preparation committee members.

509
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:14,069
Oh, all right.

510
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:22,069
- Hey, Ah Reum. 
 - Yes?

511
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:24,336
What's going on?

512
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:26,269
Because of the Hanwoo Beef Festival,

513
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:30,202
they say we need to lift the traffic control because of a mixer truck.

514
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:32,102
There's no way, really.

515
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,302
What if we move the judging venue?

516
00:35:33,302 --> 00:35:36,102
That's no easy task.

517
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:39,302
Still, it's Kang Hee's work, we should do something.

518
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:45,102
Well, we do this every year, so it's fine. 
    

519
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,869
Tourists will come from far away

520
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:50,802
to enjoy some delicious beef.

521
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:52,780
But imagine how surprised they would be

522
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,360
if they made eye contact with a real cow?

523
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:59,436
Well, there have been some complaints before.

524
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:03,069
Exactly, this is the chance to move the judging venue, as I've been suggesting.

525
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:06,169
Those in favor, please raise your hand. Hands.

526
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:12,069
I'll go offer free house call services

527
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,069
for the entire month!

528
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:14,969
- What? 
 - A month?

529
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:18,502
Including nutrient supplement services!

530
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,469
Everyone's good with that, right? Yes?

531
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,502
   

532
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:24,069
They're moving the judging venue?

533
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,136
Yes, it's too close to the festival booths, and it seems dangerous.

534
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:31,236
If the vet says so, then, well…

535
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,202
Thank you, sir.

536
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:40,369
I'll be right back. I'm going to the restroom.

537
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:57,736
 Goodbye. 

538
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,436
 Kang Hee. 

539
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:04,002
 You… Be good to your dad. 

540
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:08,669
 Your dad isn't someone who would run a motel in the countryside and live a measly life. 

541
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:11,869
 Living like this, in such a state, if you come down to it, 

542
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,836
 it's all because of you. 

543
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:17,902
 - If she hadn't gotten pregnant…  
  - Shut up, you're drunk! 

544
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,736
 Right? Am I wrong? 

545
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:23,736
 After rejecting the mayor's daughter, the county governor's daughter, 

546
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:28,036
 he ended up involved with some girl of unknown background. 

547
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:30,602
 Look at that, that! Look at those eyes! 

548
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:31,936
 Kids, just go. Hurry up and go. 

549
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:35,636
 - Kang Hee, let's go. 
 - Ah, let me go. 

550
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:38,469
 Chun Pil's mother also passed away because of that. 

551
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:39,969
 She died mad with anger. 

552
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:42,569
 Ji Kang Hee even drove her own grandmother insane! 

553
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:44,136
 You're saying all sorts of things to the kid. 

554
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,436
 What? Am I wrong? 

555
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:47,602
 No, stop it. Just stop! 

556
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:51,102
 Where did this… 

557
00:37:53,736 --> 00:37:55,902
 What is this? 

558
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,036
 Goodness, what is it? 

559
00:37:58,036 --> 00:37:59,402
 Hey, you, Ji Kang Hee! 

560
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,702
 Aren't you going to open the door? 

561
00:38:00,702 --> 00:38:02,702
 Come here, you rascal! 

562
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:04,769
 Sticking out your tongue? I'm going to… 

563
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,569
 Come here! Goodbye? 

564
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:07,669
 Hey, Kang Hee! 

565
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:10,169
 I need to poop! 

566
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:23,102
Sir.

567
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:29,636
- You know about the festival, right? 
 - Yes.

568
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:33,969
Then, did you know that the traffic is also being controlled up ahead?

569
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,436
Our cows in Hana-eup...

570
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,969
are of a very good breed.

571
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:44,702
These cows need to travel safely.

572
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:47,402
But we need a concrete mixer truck to come in that day.

573
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:50,636
You don't need to report everything to me.

574
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:57,269
- How about we solve our own things ourselves? 
 - Excuse me?

575
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,702
I'm now doing well with the festival work.

576
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:04,736
And you are fully committed to the construction.

577
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:07,036
So, Ms. Kang Hee…

578
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:15,136
Do you realize how hard she is trying to meet...

579
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,702
the opening date?

580
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:19,402
Yes.

581
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:26,802
He only knows one thing, not the other.

582
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:30,336
It seems like he doesn't know anything at all.

583
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,936
Hey, are you Ji Kang Hee?

584
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,902
Hello.

585
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,102
Good to see you.

586
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:43,669
First, just apologize.

587
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:47,169
When I think about how I suffered being locked in the warehouse because of you,

588
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,302
it angers me to the point where I wake up abruptly while sleeping.

589
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:53,669
Oh dear, I wonder why I did that.

590
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:56,369
You were always disrespectful since you were young.

591
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:59,402
Talking back to elders and always getting into trouble.

592
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:02,736
Ah, sir, that's enough. It's all in the past.

593
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,736
Past? Look at this.

594
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,969
What about the trauma?

595
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:10,002
Compensate me.

596
00:40:10,002 --> 00:40:13,536
Didn't you get a wealthy boyfriend?

597
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,402
Not my boyfriend, but my company's manager.

598
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:18,069
Whatever.

599
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:21,702
You have to compensate first, if you want to do construction in this neighborhood.

600
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:25,536
Go and try to persuade him well.

601
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:29,469
Sir, please think it over.

602
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,736
I will apologize, all right?

603
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:34,769
Am I supposed to kneel down?

604
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:37,569
Oh, right, that sounds good.

605
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,069
Try kneeling. Let's see.

606
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,236
It seems too precious to be seen alone.

607
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:43,202
Then, how about this?

608
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:45,836
If you gather all the festival preparation committee members,

609
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:50,469
I will go to that place and kneel down and apologize right away.

610
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:53,702
Do both that and separately.

611
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:54,936
Hurry and kneel down!

612
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:56,469
If you contact them first…

613
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:59,269
Kneel down quickly! Don't try to resist.

614
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:01,636
Stop it, sir.

615
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:06,669
If you do that, whether it's an apology or compensation, it should be done by you.

616
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:10,069
Don't you remember what you said to Kang Hee back then?

617
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:12,736
What did I do?

618
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,236
Come.

619
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:15,902
You…

620
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:18,336
Oh, you guys, really!

621
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,436
Kang Hee.

622
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:27,536
What are you doing? I'm working right now.

623
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:29,236
You don't have to do this.

624
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,002
I'll collect all the consent forms.

625
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,769
- You… 
 - Why?

626
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:35,902
Why are you helping me? By what right?

627
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:42,069
I've survived just fine in Seoul for 10 years, starting from the bottom.

628
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:46,869
I've been through all kinds of tough times, and there were people worse than that.

629
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:49,070
Sorry.

630
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:53,069
- I'm sorry, Kang Hee. 
 - Do you have anything to do with me?

631
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:57,036
You should have just ignored it, just walked on by.

632
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:59,236
I know everything.

633
00:42:01,036 --> 00:42:03,269
How can I pretend not to know?

634
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:06,202
How could I just stay silent?

635
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:08,969
I hate it! That's why I hate it.

636
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:11,840
Because you know all about my dark past and my wounds.

637
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,730
That's why…

638
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,369
it hurts to see you.

639
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:32,336
 Why did we have to meet like this? 

640
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:36,469
 I didn't want to show you this side of me. 

641
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:47,569
Oh, manager.

642
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,769
It's all taken care of, right?

643
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,702
There are people here.

644
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,569
What about the wire mesh work?

645
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:57,336
We're on it, trust the person in charge. 
    

646
00:42:57,336 --> 00:42:58,402
What about the manager?

647
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:01,469
He left a while ago, for a phone call?

648
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:06,136
It's been resolved.

649
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:09,102
- What? 
 - Traffic control.

650
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:10,702
They said it's been lifted.

651
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:11,769
Really?

652
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,069
Ah, this turned out well. As expected from Manager Geum.

653
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,469
How?

654
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:21,569
Well… I happen to be quite persuasive.

655
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:24,636
And I tend to be particularly likable, too.

656
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:28,336
There's no way they would have agreed so easily.

657
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:31,769
Countryside folks aren't so easily swayed.

658
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:35,069
- Especially the people of Hana-eup… 
 - There's always a way.

659
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:36,869
I even contributed to the festival development fund

660
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:39,769
and agreed to sponsor the after-party.

661
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:45,002
Besides, I decided to receive a little help from Ms. Kang Hee's friends.

662
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:47,402
- What friends? 
 - You know, friends.

663
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:49,336
So who is it?

664
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,369
Gangsters?

665
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:56,469
They said they wanted to help, even before I asked for it.

666
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:59,669
Gosh. You're suddenly changing the traffic control section?

667
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:02,836
This is going to be an enormous amount of work.

668
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:07,302
Hey, but I'm… I'm proud to have a friend who cooperates,

669
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:09,636
a true support for the people.

670
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:10,802
Are you being sarcastic?

671
00:44:10,802 --> 00:44:12,569
I won't do it. I won't!

672
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:15,369
No, our people's support…

673
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:16,902
Is also handsome.

674
00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:18,636
And cool.

675
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:20,602
Where should I start?

676
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,700
   

677
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,469
   

678
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,069
Quickly! Quickly!

679
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:31,980
   

680
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:46,310
   

681
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:52,702
There, spray on that side too.

682
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,002
Push it a bit more this way.

683
00:44:56,002 --> 00:44:57,302
No, that way.

684
00:44:57,302 --> 00:44:58,969
Are you upset?

685
00:44:59,602 --> 00:45:01,336
Yes.

686
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,702
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang Hee.

687
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:09,069
No, it's not at you. I am angry at myself.

688
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,702
They're my friends.

689
00:45:14,302 --> 00:45:18,702
They're the friends who truly wish for my success more than anyone.

690
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:23,036
Friends who would help gladly whenever asked.

691
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:29,336
All I need to do is receive help and thank them.

692
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:33,136
But I couldn't do even that.

693
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:36,536
Because my feelings were twisted.

694
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:42,169
If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't have been able to start, and I would have been a total loser.

695
00:45:46,302 --> 00:45:49,502
Thank you, Manager Geum.

696
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:51,102
Are you serious?

697
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:52,836
Of course, it's genuine.

698
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:57,102
Then let's go to the after-party together, to eat beef, at the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

699
00:45:57,569 --> 00:45:59,336
Sure.

700
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:02,669
I don't do this for just anyone.

701
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:04,536
All right, here we go.

702
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:10,236
Thank you! Thank you!

703
00:46:10,236 --> 00:46:12,369
Thanks to you, the construction went well today. Thank you.

704
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,136
Oh my, don't just settle for this.

705
00:46:15,136 --> 00:46:17,036
Show me the cash envelope.

706
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:19,369
Goodness, you!

707
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:20,902
I'm sure he'll take care of it well.

708
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:25,002
Goodness! He gave ten million won for the festival fund. Stop pushing!

709
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:27,469
But the people of our village…

710
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:32,469
Would it be too much to have a tour for the festival in the next town?

711
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:33,802
Ah, that…

712
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:35,669
I'll discuss it with Ms. Kang Hee.

713
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:36,702
Enjoy your meal.

714
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:39,269
Wait! I just need a definite answer.

715
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:42,569
Hey, Kang Hee! Ji Kang Hee!

716
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,802
Go on. Go, quickly.

717
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:50,302
- Hello. 
 - Have you been well?

718
00:46:50,302 --> 00:46:53,836
- Hello. 
 - Oh, Yeon Soo. Come here.

719
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:55,536
Welcome, veterinarian couple.

720
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:57,069
- Hello. 
 - Oh, our Su Ji.

721
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:59,669
You don't know how much we adore Ms. Yoon.

722
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:04,336
Aww! She's pretty, kind, and diligent.

723
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:05,402
Gosh! You're lovely!

724
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:07,969
It's because you treat me so well.

725
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:09,736
She also speaks so nicely.

726
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:11,836
It's a match made in heaven!

727
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:15,069
Manager Geum, our Yeon Soo is lucky. Right?

728
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:18,836
Ah, yes, the two are a good match.

729
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:21,736
Cheon Yeon Soo.

730
00:47:22,502 --> 00:47:24,302
Congratulations.

731
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:27,869
Congratulations, ma'am.

732
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:31,469
Oh, right, thank you.

733
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:34,402
Congratulations to you, too.

734
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:38,269
I wondered what kind of person you'd become. But you've succeeded, right?

735
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:40,836
You've got good skills, too.

736
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:44,669
Absolutely no returns on this one.

737
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:47,036
No, no. Well, we…

738
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:48,336
We'll leave.

739
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:50,302
All right, goodbye.

740
00:48:02,036 --> 00:48:03,236
Ms. Kang Hee.

741
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:05,469
It seems that people might have some misunderstandings.

742
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,269
I'm sorry.

743
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:12,036
Just until the construction is over, I'll use you just one more time.

744
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:17,802
I don't want to.

745
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:20,202
This time, I have conditions too.

746
00:48:23,002 --> 00:48:25,869
Seung Eon, today is the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

747
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,460
Do you want to go together…

748
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,000
not together, though?

749
00:48:31,102 --> 00:48:32,236
Hey, Cha Seung Eon.

750
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:36,136
You've got nothing to do today, right? Do you…

751
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:39,200
No, why does this keep…

752
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,736
No, let's think this over.

753
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:42,602
 Ah Reum! 

754
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:47,936
Wait a minute, I'll go to you.

755
00:48:47,936 --> 00:48:50,202
Stay there.

756
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:03,969
Are you off work?

757
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:05,136
Yeah.

758
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:07,769
Were you on your way somewhere?

759
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,036
- Yeah. 
 - Where?

760
00:49:11,102 --> 00:49:13,036
I don't know.

761
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,136
Do you have a moment?

762
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,502
Yeah, why?

763
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:20,236
Han… Hanwoo…

764
00:49:22,402 --> 00:49:24,669
It's the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

765
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:28,402
Do you want to go together?

766
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:31,136
Just the two of us?

767
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:33,402
If we go, all the kids will probably be there.

768
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:39,836
Yeah, let's go.

769
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:42,202
Let's go.

770
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:53,969
Boss.

771
00:49:56,436 --> 00:49:58,236
Boss?

772
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,102
Yes?

773
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,169
It's time for you to go.

774
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,136
Kang Hee,

775
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:33,236
can we talk for a minute?

776
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:34,936
I'm all done though.

777
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:36,969
I have nothing to say.

778
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,790
Then, just listen.

779
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,460
- Actually, Ms. Yoon and I… 
 - Impressive, isn't it?

780
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:48,202
You and me, both.

781
00:50:48,202 --> 00:50:52,836
We received congratulations from people.

782
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:57,436
I didn't realize that the Hana-eup adults knew how to give blessings, too.

783
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:59,469
I'm at a loss for words.

784
00:51:01,502 --> 00:51:03,969
Even to people like us.

785
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:08,402
They pretend to worry, pretend to do favors.

786
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,102
While they were harsh and cruel before.

787
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:13,836
Why do you remember such things?

788
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:16,802
Just erase it.

789
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:20,069
Forget it and live.

790
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:22,936
- But that's not what's important… 
 - Exactly.

791
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:26,669
I should have.

792
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:30,436
But I'm trying to do so now.

793
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:36,169
Because there's no need to hear such things anymore.

794
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:43,202
Ms. Kang Hee!

795
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,802
Did you drink?

796
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,336
Ah, yes.

797
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:51,302
His mother kept offering it to me.

798
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:53,736
I ran away under the excuse of looking for him.

799
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,790
Director, please go and find your mother.

800
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,730
I will be with unnie…

801
00:51:57,736 --> 00:52:00,702
I can call you "unnie", right? 
  (*Means older sister) 

802
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,102
On the day of Chil Ddaeng surgery,

803
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:06,610
if it weren't for you,

804
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:10,100
it would have been really tough for me.

805
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:12,269
Thank you, Unnie.

806
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,269
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

807
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:18,069
Ah, next time…

808
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:20,036
I have company.

809
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,069
Really?

810
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:25,269
Then, next time, for sure!

811
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:29,236
You got it? Right?

812
00:52:29,236 --> 00:52:30,902
Right?

813
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:35,369
Ms. Yoon, please stop it.

814
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,336
Next time, for sure!

815
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,736
 She's pretty, 

816
00:52:53,736 --> 00:52:55,820
 kind and diligent. 

817
00:52:56,836 --> 00:52:59,469
 It's because you treat me so well. 

818
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:01,202
 She also speaks so nicely. 

819
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:04,002
 It's a match made in heaven! 

820
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:07,769
It must be nice, Cheon Yeon Soo.

821
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:23,502
 Well… The thing about us working together, 

822
00:53:23,502 --> 00:53:26,969
 I think we might have to put it on hold. 

823
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:31,069
 Why? Because the rumor has spread all over town? 

824
00:53:32,169 --> 00:53:34,536
 I don't want to. 

825
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:37,040
 Thanks to that, I don't get nagged at home, 

826
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,900
 nor am I told to go for dates. 

827
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:40,769
 I am saying I like things the way they are now. 

828
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:43,402
 Can't we just pretend to date for the time being? 

829
00:53:43,402 --> 00:53:45,469
 No way. 

830
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:47,169
 Why not? 

831
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:50,836
 I have someone I like. 

832
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,736
 Right now, I'm waiting for that person. 

833
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:56,102
 Exactly. 

834
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:59,936
 If you also have someone you like, you don't need to go on dates unwillingly. 

835
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:03,802
 Let's just date until that person comes, just for the time being. 

836
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:06,302
 After all, the rumor has already spread. 

837
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:10,002
 What's the difference between clarifying it now or later? 

838
00:54:10,002 --> 00:54:13,202
 What will you do if the rumor becomes too much to handle? 

839
00:54:13,202 --> 00:54:16,936
 Then, let's just go out, whatever. 

840
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:18,069
 What? 

841
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:21,536
 Ah, I'm just kidding. 

842
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:26,102
 I really want to see who the person you like so much is. 

843
00:54:26,102 --> 00:54:29,069
 Just to see her face once. 

844
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,460
   

845
00:54:37,002 --> 00:54:40,236
   

846
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:43,802
He must be somewhere around here.

847
00:54:43,802 --> 00:54:46,402
- Ah, he's not answering. 
 - Hey!

848
00:54:46,402 --> 00:54:48,836
Your husband is over there.

849
00:54:59,102 --> 00:55:01,769
Hey! Hey!

850
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,102
What are you doing?

851
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,702
Oh, what's wrong?

852
00:55:09,702 --> 00:55:12,336
Trying to seduce my husband?

853
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:15,502
Me? What are you talking about?

854
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:17,769
These people, really…

855
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:32,902
Hey, get up!

856
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:35,802
Hey, what have I done for you to…

857
00:55:43,536 --> 00:55:45,336
Dae Sik!

858
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:51,069
Dae Sik!

859
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:52,669
What did you say? In front of her?

860
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:55,402
The whole neighborhood is watching.

861
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:57,236
Hey, Dae Sik!

862
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:02,402
Hey, calm down.

863
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,969
You know me, right? Dae Sik!

864
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,236
Have a drink with me.

865
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,169
It's okay. It's okay.

866
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:17,602
 Mom, what's going on? 

867
00:56:17,602 --> 00:56:22,136
 Kang Hee, please call Dad. 

868
00:56:22,136 --> 00:56:23,769
I understand. I know.

869
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:26,502
 - Mom!  
 - Have a drink with me.

870
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,336
I just took one love shot.

871
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:40,136
Sir, what's wrong? What's the matter?

872
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:41,802
- What is it? 
 - Min Goo, no, it's not…

873
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:45,202
Min Goo, I'll take care of everything.

874
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:46,802
All right.

875
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:48,669
We will handle the cleanup, so please go about your business.

876
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:50,402
Oh, what a lovely day.

877
00:56:50,402 --> 00:56:51,902
Just keep doing what you were doing.

878
00:56:51,902 --> 00:56:55,336
Everything is okay.

879
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:58,502
Look, the hero arrives.

880
00:56:59,636 --> 00:57:02,969
Well… what should I have done, then?

881
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:09,436
Whenever Ms. Su Ji is mentioned, both then and now,

882
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:12,069
you just…

883
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:14,469
Isn't she pitiful?

884
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:16,902
Then what about me?

885
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,269
What about Mom?

886
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:27,502
What about my brother who died?

887
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:44,002
Ah, it's annoying.

888
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:56,502
I've gotten too old to loathe freely.

889
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,269
My hair has completely turned white

890
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,502
and I have many wrinkles.

891
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:07,469
No, what would you do if you got hurt? Why on earth are you doing this?

892
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:10,336
I really can't get it.

893
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,236
Just for you.

894
00:58:19,236 --> 00:58:21,036
Who?

895
00:58:54,302 --> 00:58:55,402
Who was it?

896
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:57,636
Who said to give it to me?

897
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:00,069
Who else could it be?

898
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,302
Cheon Yeon Soo!

899
00:59:16,402 --> 00:59:18,202
Kkam Hee.

900
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:21,536
What? Were you alone?

901
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:29,602
No, it's someone else's room.

902
00:59:30,102 --> 00:59:31,702
Why are you crying?

903
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,636
You have no food?

904
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:27,702
Teddy bear.

905
01:00:32,636 --> 01:00:34,836
 I have just one favor to ask. 

906
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:42,736
 Sell the teddy bear and take care of Charlie after she gives birth. 

907
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:46,902
 And if there's money left, please feed the kittens too. 

908
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,736
Cheon Yeon Soo, you clueless teddy bear.

909
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:41,436
Why do you keep doing this to me?

910
01:02:42,669 --> 01:02:45,036
Cheon Yeon Soo, you!

911
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:47,269
Why did you help me?

912
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,302
Answer me!

913
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:59,369
Do you like me?

914
01:03:10,702 --> 01:03:13,702
That's all I can do.

915
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:17,902
I can't even wipe away your tears.

916
01:03:18,602 --> 01:03:22,402
As someone who was rejected by his first love, I can't hold you back either.

917
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:27,502
This was all I could do for you, for one last time.

918
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:31,702
Can I not even do that?

919
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,602
You hate it?

920
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:42,902
One last time? Who says it's the last time?

921
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,802
Who said you could change the ending as you please?

922
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:49,069
I know, the beginning and the end are always up to you.

923
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:53,369
But I need some time.

924
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:56,469
Time? What time?

925
01:03:57,069 --> 01:03:59,236
Time to forget you.

926
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:06,102
So, don't worry.

927
01:04:06,102 --> 01:04:09,169
Don't feel burdened, and don't get angry.

928
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:15,769
Just give me some time.

929
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:25,420


930
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:34,320
♫  Stay by my side, like the rain  ♫

931
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,550
♫  that always falls  ♫

932
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:46,450
♫  Don't leave my side, let's chat  ♫

933
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:50,810
♫  underneath the crescent moon  ♫

934
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:57,840
♫  You're still everything to me  ♫

935
01:04:57,845 --> 01:05:03,750
    
 ♫  Please be my forest, embrace me  ♫

936
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:10,840
♫  Oh my light, I'll be your ocean  ♫

937
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:16,680
♫  and embrace your tender heart   ♫

938
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,530
   

939
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,700
 The motel construction was just an excuse.  

940
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,520
 I heard you were marrying someone, so I came to check. 

941
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,560
 Give this to Yeon Soo when he finds his match.  

942
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,030
 I hope it's someone loving and gentle 

943
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,860
 who grew up receiving lots of love from a normal family.  

944
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:41,970
 I hope your family is happy for generations in this rural town of Hana-Eup,  

945
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,080
 Cheon Yeon Soo. 

946
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,540
 Grandpa, you know I'm really good holding back, right? 

947
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:50,800
 But when it comes to Kang Hee, I can't hold back. So I'm just going to tell her. 

948
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:56,030
 I'm sorry. It must've been so hard for you, but I didn't realize.
