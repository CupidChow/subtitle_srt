1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,170


2
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:39,000
   
 Cheon Yeon Soo, what do you think love is? 

3
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:42,767
 Listening and obeying well? 

4
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,067
 No. 

5
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:47,267
 Giving up your sugar stars? 

6
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:48,633
 No. 

7
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:54,333
 Then… wanting to see someone every day? 

8
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,800
 That's not it either. 

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,733
 Then what is it? 

10
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,767
 Love is... 

11
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,567
 being by each other's side. 

12
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,133
 Like this? 

13
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:16,033
 Yeah, and giving a tight hug. 

14
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,567
 Holding hands is okay, too. 

15
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,100
 - Really? 
 - Yeah. 

16
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,367
   

17
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:29,433
 Oh dear, dumb bear. 

18
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,733
 I said I hate it. Give me a different one!  

19
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,800
 What's wrong with being number 3? 

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
 Why am I number 3? 

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,033
 We won the stick-hopping game because of me. 

22
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:44,000
 I'm stronger than Han Woo and Seung Eon. 

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,833
 Gosh, dumb bear! 

24
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,360
 We are a family, the Kang Hee family.  

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,700
 Do you think the numbers are random? 

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,900
 Seung Eon has been with us since he was 7, so he is number 1. 

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,833
 Han Woo has been playing with us since he was 8, so he is number 2. 

28
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,567
 And you moved here when you were 9. 

29
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:04,333
 Then, what do I have to do to become number 1? 

30
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,233
 I really want to be your number 1. 

31
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,667
 Well? I don't know. 

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,433
 Hey! 

33
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,367
The words "I love you"...

34
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,000
are said when people are leaving.

35
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,500
Yeon Soo,

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,800
what I am trying to say…

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,533
Don't do it.

38
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,233
Don't do it, please!

39
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,267
I love you.

40
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,100
I love you, Yeon Soo.

41
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,770
♫  I realized it as I stared quietly into your eyes  ♫

42
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:00,550
♫  My love for you, fearlessly, keeps growing   ♫

43
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,530
♫  My confession that never reached you, I love you  ♫

44
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:16,860
♫  Will a part of my sincerity reach you today?  ♫

45
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,633
You said love is about hugging...

46
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,933
and holding hands.

47
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:27,667
We knew that when we were 10. Why don't we know that now?

48
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,967
Don't do this, Yeon Soo.

49
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,567
We can't go back to before the accident.

50
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:38,433
No, it doesn't matter.

51
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,333
Can't we just think about the two of us?

52
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,733
If you say it doesn't matter, will my sin disappear?

53
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:49,033
If you say you love me, if you hug me and hold my hand,

54
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,900
will what happened disappear?

55
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,367
Will my dead mother, your dead father come back to life?

56
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:01,167
Don't make it more painful, Yeon Soo.

57
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,600
Fine, do as you like.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,667
But just know this,

59
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,633
no matter how much you try to avoid and hide,

60
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,733
nothing will change.

61
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,267
You will come back again,

62
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,333
because I'll be right here.

63
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,020
♫  I love you  ♫

64
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,850
♫  My confession to you  ♫

65
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,530
♫  Feels more precious than yesterday  ♫

66
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,220
♫  My shy, hesitant first words to you  ♫

67
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:54,860
♫  Those seemingly meaningless words contained my feelings for you  ♫

68
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,900
♫  I may not have said "I love you"  ♫

69
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,720
♫  But it was all love  ♫

70
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,540
♫  Look, I'm doing it again  ♫

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,420
♫  I'm still shaking  ♫

72
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,200
♫  Will you hold my hand and hold me close?  ♫

73
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,850
♫  It took me longer than everyone else  ♫

74
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,540
♫  But I was the most sincere  ♫

75
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:40,440
♫  Every day that passed took me a lot of courage  ♫

76
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:51,940
♫  I might be late in saying "I love you"  ♫

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,200
   

78
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,267
What's the matter?

79
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeon Soo.

80
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:28,433
   

81
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,500
   

82
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,033
   

83
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,233
Ms. Kang Hee.

84
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:53,300
I took care of the registration in advance, since we're hospital mates.

85
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,167
See, I told you I could come alone.

86
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,833
- Yes. 
 - Goodbye.

87
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,767
- Patient Ji Chun Pil. 
 - Yes.

88
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:09,167
Stay here, it's all right.

89
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,640
   

90
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,600
The results are not good.

91
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,367
Has it relapsed?

92
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,100
Is he your guardian?

93
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,533
Yes, I'm his son.

94
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,867
Let's get you admitted first.

95
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,467
Will we have to do chemotherapy again?

96
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:46,767
Yes, besides chemotherapy, there are no other options.

97
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,370
   

98
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,567
Here it is.

99
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,067
- Yes, it's all done. 
 - Thank you.

100
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,300
   

101
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:23,100
 The customer's phone is turned off, please leave a message… 

102
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,367
Have you tried giving a confession?

103
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:50,667
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

104
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,533
God illuminates our hearts.

105
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,733
Firmly believing in God's mercy,

106
00:11:56,733 --> 00:12:01,700
confess truthfully the sins you have committed.

107
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:09,300
My heart is stronger than that of most priests.

108
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,900
I'll listen to any confession...

109
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,567
and keep your secrets.

110
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,233
Does God...

111
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,600
forgive any sin if it's confessed?

112
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,033
Does He forgive anything?

113
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,867
Of course.

114
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,967
I killed someone.

115
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,800
I killed my mom and Yeon Soo's dad,

116
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:48,367
and then I forgot about it for 20 years.

117
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,600
Then I dared to love Yeon Soo.

118
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,633
Can I be forgiven, too?

119
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,233
Can He forgive someone like me?

120
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,600
Do you know how to turn yourself in?

121
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,233
I did some research.

122
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,400
This is all that comes up?

123
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,700
- Open it. 
 - How are you planning to turn yourself in?

124
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,700
Do you have any evidence?

125
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,567
The doll that you supposedly shoved in, it's gone now. Right?

126
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,560
What about the car?

127
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,633
It has already been scrapped, and it's gone. Right?

128
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,767
How old were you back then?

129
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,467
You were young.

130
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,000
You found that memory after 20 years,

131
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
how can you be sure it's true or not?

132
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:07,800
You just want to punish yourself.

133
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:12,933
You didn't even talk to Yeon Soo, you just cut ties and ran away. Right?

134
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,467
Shouldn't Yeon Soo be the one giving the punishment, if there is any?

135
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,600
Whether you apologize or get punished,

136
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:23,667
shouldn't you at least talk to Yeon Soo first?

137
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,133
   

138
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,733
Mr. Yeon Soo.

139
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,833
Chun Pil was diagnosed with leukemia 3 years ago.

140
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:00,433
He had 12 rounds of chemotherapy back then.

141
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,233
I had no idea, not at all.

142
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:06,067
I also had cancer surgery back then.

143
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,067
 - Mr. Tarzan? 
 - Ms. Hepburn? 

144
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,300
 - Hello. 
 - Oh, yes. 

145
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,900
Did you hear that we met at a classic film gathering?

146
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,567
 Here… 

147
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,300
 The hospital life alone was a bit scary and lonely. 

148
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,900
 Meeting Mr. Tarzan has been a great help. 

149
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,667
 I also matched outfits with Ms. Hepburn like this. 

150
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:47,533
 This kind of walk makes it bearable. 

151
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:53,100
 Let's be hospital friends. 

152
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,267
 Until each of us has a guardian, 

153
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:59,567
 let's come to the hospital together. 

154
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:06,067
 Let's end the hospital life altogether. 

155
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,290
 Once I finish this round of chemotherapy, 

156
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,500
 I don't plan on coming back anymore. 

157
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,367
I thought he was just saying that back then,

158
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,862
but it seemed he was serious.

159
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,628
He said he won't receive any more treatment.

160
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,200
I can't persuade him.

161
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,200
So, Mr. Yeon Soo, please try to talk to him.

162
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:36,067
Where is he now?

163
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,300
Anyway, the night view here is really…

164
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,067
The night view is really beautiful.

165
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:53,833
I was planning to spend this Christmas here with you.

166
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeon Soo, Merry Christmas.

167
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,233
Oh, Merry Christmas in advance.

168
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,233
Merry Christmas in advance, sir.

169
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,700
Enough.

170
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,733
- I've made up my mind, Yeon Soo. 
 - About what?

171
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,567
I need to change my car.

172
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,567
- I'm going to change it to a camper. 
 - All of a sudden?

173
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:24,110
Driving around wherever my feet take me, to places with no name...

174
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,633
and suddenly disappear without a trace.

175
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:31,400
Then to prevent that, I must follow you around.

176
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,933
But there's just one thing that bothers me.

177
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,667
I'm worried about Kang Hee and Seung Eon.

178
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:47,467
Well, you said you'd take responsibility for Kang Hee.

179
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,267
What about me?

180
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:55,100
To me, you are like a father.

181
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,433
Why exclude me?

182
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:59,500
You're not worried about me?

183
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:03,433
Sir,

184
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,300
can you please do the chemotherapy?

185
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,333
Or at least,

186
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:14,567
just get admitted.

187
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,267
Hospital gowns don't suit me.

188
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,367
What doesn't suit you?

189
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:24,333
If you walk down the hospital corridor wearing a hospital gown, it's like a runway.

190
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:29,267
That's because you're my fan.

191
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:35,067
It's not because I'm your fan, it's because I'm your son.

192
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:41,567
Do you know how many memories you and I have together?

193
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,133
I once told you that you looked cool playing the guitar.

194
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:53,633
Then you taught me how to play the guitar.

195
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,333
Because I was chubby,

196
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:06,733
when I told you that my friends wouldn't play sports with me,

197
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,033
you played soccer and basketball with me.

198
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,933
You talk too much, brat.

199
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,072
Until you say you'll get treated,

200
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:24,400
just know that I won't give up on you.

201
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,600
Chemotherapy makes all your hair fall out.

202
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:44,000
I spent so much effort regrowing my hair.

203
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,467
Let's not tell Kang Hee.

204
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:58,133
I haven't done much for her until now.

205
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,567
Finally,

206
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,533
she's able to smile and go about her life.

207
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:10,300
I don't want to make it hard for her.

208
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,233
 Kang Hee is not living happily. 

209
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:16,500
 She is struggling right now. 

210
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,133
 So you have to hold on, sir. Please. 

211
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,300
Instead of Kang Hee,

212
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,767
I'll take care of you.

213
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:36,333
I don't want you to struggle, either.

214
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,000
It's not hard for me.

215
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,933
 No matter how much you try to avoid or hide, 

216
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:39,367
 nothing will change. 

217
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,700
 You'll come back again... 

218
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,567
 because I'll be right here. 

219
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,267
I'm sorry, Yeon Soo.

220
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm sorry.

221
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:13,833
   

222
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,767
Good morning.

223
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,733
Where is Yeon Soo?

224
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,500
Probably went out?

225
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,600
Did he come in last night?

226
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,100
Probably?

227
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,867
Mr. Kwon, you're neglecting your duties.

228
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:42,433
No way…

229
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,100
Kang Hee.

230
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,100
- Where's Yeon Soo? 
 - Weren't you staying together in Seoul?

231
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,667
He said he had to go somewhere for a few days due to work.

232
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,733
I think it's probably that he's going for interviews.

233
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,833
What interviews?

234
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,500
He's been searching for veterinary researcher jobs.

235
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,233
I thought he talked this over with you.

236
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,120
   

237
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,840
   

238
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,967
Ms. Yoon,

239
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,400
are you there?

240
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,733
Are you not there?

241
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,567
It's me, Nan Woo.

242
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,900
It seems she's not here.

243
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:59,433
I can't face Han Woo anymore.

244
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:04,433
I shouldn't have interfered when you told me not to.

245
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
I'm embarrassed.

246
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,767
Why? Didn't Han Woo thank you that day?

247
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,833
- Really? 
 - I would be grateful, too.

248
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:20,267
You worried about me, ran to me, and caught me.

249
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:27,100
I'm glad you think that way.

250
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,733
Have you sorted all...

251
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,800
your feelings for Yeon Soo?

252
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,433
Why should I sort them out?

253
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:43,500
I can't sort them out.

254
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:49,167
To me, the director

255
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:52,800
is like… an idol star?

256
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,000
He was, he is, and will always be

257
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,633
someone I respect and support.

258
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,167
Yes.

259
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,933
Then, what about Han Woo?

260
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,667
Do you like Han Woo?

261
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,467
Then…

262
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,467
That's not right, is it?

263
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,667
Why not?

264
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,333
Is it okay?

265
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:22,767
I don't know.

266
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:26,633
Now's not the time for me to advise others on their love life.

267
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:28,467
I have my own problems to deal with.

268
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,167
Uh, what's this? Who is it?

269
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,333
I always tell you everything.

270
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,300
I promise I won't tell Yeon Soo.

271
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,033
I won't even tell Han Woo, okay?

272
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,100
Hey, you like Ms. Yoon. Right?

273
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,580
What?

274
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,840
Huh?

275
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,700
It's obvious.

276
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,000
What's obvious? No, it's not like that.

277
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,633
We're just getting closer, that's all.

278
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:53,467
What?

279
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,633
Hey, Han Ah Reum.

280
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,000
Did you get kicked out, too?

281
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,800
Let's talk.

282
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,533
Okay.

283
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:21,167
Seung Eon, I've made up my mind.

284
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:25,367
Now it's your turn. There's something you need to do.

285
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:32,165
What my mom said about you being an uneducated orphan,

286
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,733
I apologize for that.

287
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:37,500
Sorry.

288
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,933
But even if you can't help with other things,

289
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:42,467
you can avoid this with a middle school diploma.

290
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,267
You know I have a teaching certificate, right?

291
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:53,100
I'll help you prepare for the GED.

292
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:57,033
Think about it and let me know.

293
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:05,533
Am I supposed to carry the luggage?

294
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,867
   

295
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,220
 Yeon Soo, where are you? 

296
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,560
 Let's meet. I have something to say. 

297
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,700
 Could you let me know when you're available to talk? 

298
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,033
 I think I've been selfish. 

299
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,800
 Contact me, I'll wait. 

300
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,133
 Can we talk for a bit today? 

301
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:38,767
 I went to the clinic, and you weren't there. 

302
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:42,467
 Where are you, Yeon Soo? 

303
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,867
   

304
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,600
You are here.

305
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,033
Baton touch.

306
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,433
You can go now, Mr. Yeon Soo.

307
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,500
I have to be here, we're family.

308
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,433
After getting him admitted, your part is over.

309
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:13,167
I'll handle the rest as his hospital mate.

310
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:17,867
- It's okay, still… 
 - Go back, don't worry.

311
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,433
I knew this would happen, so I bought it.

312
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:47,367
Haven't you heard anything from Yeon Soo yet?

313
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:58,033
Oh? Manager.

314
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,500
The veterinarian came.

315
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:19,767
We should find an owner before it gets colder.

316
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,367
Sorry, I couldn't pay attention to you.

317
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:35,470
♫  Mm, stay by my side  ♫

318
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,450
♫  Like the rain that always falls  ♫

319
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,267
Yeon Soo,

320
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:47,867
why haven't you contacted me?

321
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,633
 Let's not tell Kang Hee. 

322
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,933
 I don't want to make it hard for her. 

323
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,167
I came because I had something to say.

324
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,633
I have a lot of work delayed.

325
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:09,100
Later. Let's talk later.

326
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:17,700
♫  I'll be your ocean and embrace your tender heart   ♫

327
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,200
Why are you back so soon?

328
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,867
You probably find it uncomfortable to see me.

329
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:36,000
I was a coward.

330
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,700
I wanted to believe Yeon Soo's words that it didn't matter.

331
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,167
Listening to your advice to overcome it alongside Yeon Soo,

332
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,667
I wanted to be deceived.

333
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:53,133
You said Esther is going to the US soon?

334
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,200
Does it taste good when you eat alone?

335
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
I ordered something that tastes good even when eaten alone.

336
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,267
Is this sauce the secret?

337
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,367
It's addictive.

338
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,000
More than Kang Hee?

339
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:37,300
Kang Hee is going overseas to study with Esther.

340
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,567
I think that's a good idea too, and I plan to help.

341
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,367
Where are you going?

342
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:52,567
I need to stop them.

343
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:57,233
Do you think someone like her will feel better running away abroad?

344
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:02,200
You can't let her live her entire life with guilt, criticizing herself.

345
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:07,700
I'm going to tell her not to run away, to face it by my side.

346
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,900
As much as Kang Hee is struggling, no, even more so,

347
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,600
I am ready to bear it with her, and endure it all.

348
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,233
Study abroad?

349
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,567
All of a sudden?

350
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,433
Don't even dream about it.

351
00:33:58,433 --> 00:33:59,333
Min Goo.

352
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:02,600
Hey, no, go back.

353
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,200
If you want to register your marriage, you need to go to the town office. Why come to me?

354
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,100
Actually, if I want to see a traffic accident investigation record, what should I do?

355
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Traffic accident?

356
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,900
What? What kind? Which one?

357
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,033
You know, our parents' traffic accident long ago.

358
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:20,000
I want to know the exact details of the accident.

359
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,467
I have the right to know.

360
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,133
Yes, of course you do.

361
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,100
Hold on a second.

362
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,967
First, you need to file a viewing request.

363
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:34,467
You can't do it right now, you need to fill out the application.

364
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:37,200
- Want help? 
 - Please.

365
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,867
Wait a moment.

366
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,633
Kang Hee,

367
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,100
I can't leave you alone in vague guilt.

368
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:09,233
If my father really ended up like that because of you,

369
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:14,067
you should take care of me in place of my father.

370
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:17,133
You should hold me and cheer me up.

371
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,367
Where were you trying to run away to?

372
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,933
Nothing is certain yet.

373
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,733
No matter what the conclusion is, stay by my side.

374
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,733
Hold my hand and let's overcome it together.

375
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,700
You're cold, right?

376
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,533
Are you okay?

377
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:00,400
Sure, I'm okay.

378
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,067
Just a moment.

379
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,567
   

380
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,700
Was this why you couldn't be reached?

381
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,667
Why is this still here?

382
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,767
Be honest with me.

383
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,467
Well, it's like…

384
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,067
Are you hurt?

385
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,967
Were you hospitalized? Is it a terminal illness?

386
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,300
Not me, but someone else.

387
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,900
Someone else, who?

388
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,967
Well… I went to a conference in Seoul.

389
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:09,700
A friend was kicked by a horse and broke his ribs.

390
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,933
But I broke some of my own ribs back in the day.

391
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,867
So I gave him advice and just took care of him, as I was there…

392
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:19,767
You… You're really a terrible liar.

393
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,267
It's not a lie.

394
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:26,233
I said I'm okay.

395
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:30,033
Being a large animal vet is a dangerous job.

396
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:32,533
You be careful, too.

397
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,967
Don't worry.

398
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm the top-ranked among the cows in this town.

399
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,567
Were you thinking of getting a job elsewhere because you're number one?

400
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:44,067
I know you went for an interview, not a conference.

401
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,300
Oh.

402
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,967
We hid it from each other to avoid worrying.

403
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,967
Pushing each other away, thinking it's for the other's sake.

404
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,967
Let's avoid that.

405
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:58,967
Okay?

406
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,767
Okay.

407
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,800
Promise?

408
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,400
Promise.

409
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,500
Director.

410
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,933
Why did you come out? I told you to rest.

411
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:35,940
You said you don't like the hotel breakfast and have plans for dinner,

412
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,200
so I had to come.

413
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,833
I was a bit busy.

414
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,200
Are you dating?

415
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,467
Ah, well… it's similar.

416
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:48,667
Well, please find a replacement for me.

417
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:51,833
- Have you made up your mind? 
 - I'm trying to make a new start.

418
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,133
I don't want to be under my parents' interference here.

419
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:56,800
I hate hearing this and that even more.

420
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,600
Anyway,

421
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,400
I think I need to go to the US.

422
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,600
No way.

423
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,933
Walk carefully, it's dangerous.

424
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:17,967
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

425
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:21,167
Going abroad? Are you sure you won't think about Little Heart?

426
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,833
Can you live as if you forgot everything and nothing happened?

427
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,433
While you're missing Little Heart,

428
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,100
I don't want you to live a life full of regret.

429
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
Then what should I do?

430
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,433
Should I raise a fatherless child in Korea?

431
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:35,433
We can make it happen.

432
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,833
Esther, look at yourself properly.

433
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,833
With your beauty, intelligence, and wealth,

434
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:44,067
overflowing with charm, can't you find a father for the baby?

435
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:47,467
The only thing you're lacking is a good eye for men.

436
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,867
I'll help you with that, let's find a father together.

437
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,367
What are you talking about?

438
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,900
Hey, are you really crazy?

439
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,100
You should make a new start, but do it with Little Heart.

440
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:01,400
It's Victor, that rat, who did wrong. Why are you giving up on Little Heart?

441
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,133
You haven't done anything wrong.

442
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,567
Be confident, like Esther.

443
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:08,867
Find a man who will accept you as you are.

444
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,367
- Will there be one? 
 - There will be a line.

445
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,067
Trust me.

446
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,400
If you look inside, it has detailed information about the accident.

447
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,467
If there's something you don't know, don't hesitate to ask me.

448
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,833
Thank you, Min Goo.

449
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,867
For what? Take care of Kang Hee.

450
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,367
I'm leaving.

451
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,367
   

452
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,600
   

453
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,800
   

454
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:48,267
 Four cars that slipped on icy roads. 
   

455
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,900
 It was a fatal accident caused by a chain collision. 

456
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,100
   

457
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,533
   
 The overturned car is your father's car. 

458
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,664
Let's go.

459
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,500
Really?

460
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,000
He is tall and handsome.

461
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,633
That's really something.

462
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:47,333
I hope he comes soon.

463
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,967
Oh? Yeon Soo.

464
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,600
Oh my god!

465
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:59,767
This is a family meeting place, why are you here?

466
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:02,500
Kang Hee is my family now.

467
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,833
I won't let go of her hand.

468
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:08,567
Do you really have to make me look like a bad person?

469
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:11,900
Just don't act like the bad person, Su Ji.

470
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,567
Just stay quiet for a moment.

471
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:17,300
You know I clearly don't like her.

472
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,033
Holding hands? What are you thinking?

473
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,967
I'm sorry.

474
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:28,633
I have something important to say.

475
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,767
I'll say it and leave.

476
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,967
Let go of Yeon Soo's hand and talk.

477
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:36,400
- I'll just… 
 - Su Ji!

478
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,867
You really shouldn't be doing this.

479
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:44,167
Su Ji,

480
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,867
what's with that face?

481
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:50,900
A flower being angry and frowning?

482
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,600
A flower should smile brightly.

483
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,767
That's a right and a responsibility.

484
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,833
So a flower can't be angry?

485
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,767
If there's something to be angry about, I'll be angry myself.

486
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:07,400
So, solve it through talking

487
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,733
and soften your face.

488
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:14,633
Through conversation, gently.

489
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,167
Okay.

490
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,367
Let's resolve everything here.

491
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,900
Yes, go ahead.

492
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:30,633
I was really struggling,

493
00:44:31,446 --> 00:44:33,346
you know?

494
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,958
Your dad died suddenly in an accident,

495
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:40,128
people were gossiping so much.

496
00:44:40,128 --> 00:44:43,767
Besides the accident your dad had,

497
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:47,333
he was cheating, deceiving me.

498
00:44:49,404 --> 00:44:51,267
Let's leave that out.

499
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:55,600
It was so tough, I thought of just dying.

500
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,533
- What? 
 - Oh my!

501
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:01,933
Since I was going to die, like "Thelma &amp; Louise".

502
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,412
You know, "Thelma &amp; Louise"?

503
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:05,600
I know.

504
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,233
Let's hit it hard.

505
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:12,333
Let's go to the cliff and end it in style.

506
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:18,227
Didn't even make it to the cliff, the car broke down in the middle of nowhere.

507
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,200
Thank goodness! It was heaven's help, Su Ji.

508
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,533
Just listen.

509
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:29,611
Kang Hee, you! It was because of you!

510
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:33,077
Kang Hee, your teddy bear!

511
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:37,982
It was blocking the exhaust pipe.

512
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,140
No wonder I felt nauseous,

513
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,360
and I almost threw up while driving.

514
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,500
Mom,

515
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,633
is what you just said true?

516
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:52,067
It's the truth!

517
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:54,803
How could a child do that?

518
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:56,425
Kang Hee, you…

519
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:59,033
Just because I talked badly about your mom,

520
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:01,776
is that how you take revenge? On an adult?

521
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:05,567
I'm still too scared to drive.

522
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,833
Oh, my! Gods! Thank you!

523
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,333
You saved Su Ji's life.

524
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:15,733
It's all thanks to you that I met Su Ji today.

525
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,367
What? What is…

526
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:24,600
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

527
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,633
I was wrong.

528
00:46:27,633 --> 00:46:29,500
Please forgive me.

529
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,350
You were young,

530
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,960
why go this far…

531
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,033
Thank you so much, Mom.

532
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,733
- Thank you. 
 - No.

533
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:45,133
What's going on?

534
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,333
Cheon Yeon Soo.

535
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:59,267
So, do I have your permission?

536
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:05,067
Be happy, Mom.

537
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,767
Don't cry. It makes you ugly.

538
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:23,100
Smile brightly like a flower.

539
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:26,133
That's right, just like that.

540
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,860
   

541
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:36,700
Give me this.

542
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:40,033
Go spend some time alone.

543
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:14,400
♫  Sometimes   ♫

544
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:22,090
♫  When you spare me a gaze  ♫

545
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:28,650
♫  As if it's a part of your everyday  ♫

546
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:34,430
♫  Without a word, you grab my hands and embrace me  ♫

547
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:41,610
♫  And sometimes, suddenly  ♫

548
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:47,160
♫  I wonder if you'll ever leave me  ♫

549
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,033
I'm sorry.

550
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,433
I'm sorry for being born by mistake.

551
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,467
For thinking that I ruined everything.

552
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:02,267
I'm sorry for not loving you.

553
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,633
 It's okay now, right? 

554
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:11,833
Yes, it's okay.

555
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,130
I love you.

556
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,800
♫  Please smile for me, I don't need anything else  ♫

557
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:27,400
♫  Let me fill my eyes with you  ♫

558
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,867
Jeez!

559
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:39,233
Why are you crying?

560
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:41,400
Hey! Oh, dear!

561
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,067
Oh, my. Look how heavy this is.

562
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:48,067
No, I didn't raise cows to make money.

563
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:51,033
I made money to raise cows, Dad.

564
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:55,333
Hey, is Chil Ddaeng your child? Is it a pet?

565
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,833
You should raise and sell cows.

566
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:00,600
Jeez!

567
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,367
Gods, that's a lot!

568
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,033
Hey, let's eat. Let's eat.

569
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:09,967
I thought all that organic and animal welfare stuff was nonsense.

570
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:12,767
I'll count on you in the future too, Han Woo.

571
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:15,967
You should eat all by yourself.

572
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:18,167
Jeez!

573
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:22,267
So, don't get too attached to the cows from now on.

574
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:29,933
I miss you.

575
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:32,000
Chil Ddaeng!

576
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,500
Sampa Gwangtteng!

577
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,800
Pinggu!

578
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,567
Kkomak!

579
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:46,333
I regret raising cattle.

580
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:51,133
I had no idea it would be this hard.

581
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,300
Ms. Yoon.

582
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,300
You miss her a lot, don't you?

583
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:08,500
When, no…

584
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,300
From where did you hear it? No…

585
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,733
Did you hear us?

586
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:14,900
Earlier, I…

587
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,867
I heard it from the restaurant.

588
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:23,167
Just like you,

589
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,500
I miss Chil Ddaeng.

590
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,867
I understand how you feel.

591
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:34,300
I also pondered with the same feeling.

592
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,133
That's right.

593
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:41,933
Even lab dogs have their fate predetermined.

594
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:47,367
Whenever that happens, Director always says,

595
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,333
"Even if they are destined to die tomorrow,

596
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:57,033
we should make sure they live comfortably today."

597
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,533
While at your farm,

598
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:04,567
Chil Ddaeng was surely happy.

599
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:11,400
Thank you, Ms. Nan Woo.

600
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,800
That's really comforting.

601
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,300
Well, then, will you buy me food?

602
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,000
Yes.

603
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:26,600
I left my meal and even my friend to follow you.

604
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,167
Oh, of course, I should treat you. Let's go.

605
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,600
Yes.

606
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:34,600
Is there anything specific you'd like to eat?

607
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,067
Um, anything but beef.

608
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,967
Oh, anything but beef?

609
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,500
Um, then…

610
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,000
Mr. Chun Pil is here.

611
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:54,967
You should rest, it's late.

612
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:57,800
I have something to say to Mr. Chun Pil.

613
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,533
Mr. Chun Pil, you're here.

614
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,233
Hey, there.

615
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:34,833
I have a favor to ask.

616
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:39,433
Thank you for asking.

617
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:44,567
I'd really like you to listen.

618
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:46,100
Yeah.

619
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:51,933
Please, adopt Seung Eon.

620
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,167
Seung Eon is my brother.

621
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,367
He's not an orphan.

622
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:01,800
Thank you for saying that.

623
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:07,600
It's something I've always kept to myself as well.

624
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:10,633
I found it...

625
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:15,767
hard to say to you.

626
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:19,867
It's not a difficult favor, right?

627
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:22,800
You just need to go to the town office and apply.

628
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,433
It's that simple?

629
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:27,000
It's not like you're changing his surname or anything.

630
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,400
Just register with the family department.

631
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,933
If it's that easy, we should have done it earlier.

632
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:37,333
I feel sorry.

633
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:41,033
I'm feeling sleepy because I took some medicine.

634
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,500
But I still need to say this.

635
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,700
If I die,

636
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,200
you'll have to split the inheritance with Seung Eon, is that okay?

637
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,900
That won't do.

638
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,567
You should spend all your money and then die.

639
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:02,533
So live a long, long life.

640
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,600
I got it.

641
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,600
Are you leaving?

642
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,267
The floor is hard.

643
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,500
What is this?

644
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,800
It's medicine, what else?

645
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,867
What kind of medicine?

646
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:30,133
When you get older, everything starts to hurt.

647
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:34,800
I got them all at once because it's a hassle.

648
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeon Soo, come out.

649
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,800
Uh?

650
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:10,367
Have you ever heard that Mr. Chun Pil is sick?

651
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,067
No, I haven't heard anything.

652
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:19,033
Well, in his room there are bags full of medicine.

653
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:20,633
It's like one's daily bread.

654
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:22,333
Really?

655
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,467
It's not a fatal illness, right?

656
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:31,333
Mr. Chun Pil?

657
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,867
Go in and rest quickly.

658
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:36,600
Good night.

659
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,250
   

660
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:18,267
- Is everything packed? 
 - Yes, sir, it's all loaded.

661
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:20,267
Get in.

662
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:22,133
Oh, yes.

663
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,233
   

664
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:12,150
   

665
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,633
Ji Kang Hee.

666
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:33,100
Oh, Jin Ah. Do you work here?

667
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,633
Yeah, it's been a while.

668
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:40,000
I saw your father come with Yeon Soo.

669
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,267
Do you know why?

670
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:44,933
He comes often.

671
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:48,267
Yeon Soo's grandfather used to be here, too.

672
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:50,767
But later he was moved to the hospital.

673
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:54,700
On holidays or such occasions, your father even performs here.

674
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,700
To the elders here, Mr. Chun Pil is like an idol.

675
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:02,533
Come in.

676
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,767
Wow! Your hair has grown a lot.

677
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,867
Oh, my! It seems like you've got more hair! Have you rejuvenated?

678
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:20,000
Oh my, really.

679
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,467
Did you eat something good?

680
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:23,933
Ah, give me some too.

681
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,400
How would you like your hair done?

682
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,100
Nicely?

683
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,933
Didn't I always do it nicely?

684
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:35,667
- You look pretty no matter what. 
 - She volunteers here every other week.

685
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:38,133
Yong Su also comes once a month.

686
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:43,000
Even though Yong Su talks a lot all the time,

687
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
he's like MacGyver with his hands.

688
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,433
There's nothing he can't fix.

689
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:49,667
He fixes everything: boiler, electricity, machines.

690
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:53,600
Wait, did you eat something that good? Give me some, too.

691
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,167
I…

692
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:01,333
I don't know anything, not at all.

693
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,667
Because you didn't live here.

694
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,267
Then you probably don't know this either.

695
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,033
Portrait photos for memorial.

696
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:26,500
There are those that have been used,

697
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,767
and those that will be used.

698
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:34,800
The photos are nice. Who took them?

699
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,733
Cha Seung Eon.

700
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,567
The Cha Seung Eon I know?

701
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,567
Is there another Cha Seung Eon besides him?

702
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:45,767
It was originally your father's responsibility.

703
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,767
Seems like he decided to pass it on to Seung Eon now.

704
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:51,600
- Oh, dear! 
 - Oh, dear!

705
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,933
Sir!

706
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:55,567
Oh, no! Why did you do that?

707
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:59,300
You should have said it if you wanted to go somewhere.

708
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:03,533
 Gods! Where are you going? 

709
01:01:03,533 --> 01:01:06,367
 Here? Oh, you must be thirsty. 

710
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,967
Please fill out the admission form starting with your name.

711
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,900
Yes.

712
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,200
Sir, admission?

713
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,900
Then all of this…

714
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,210
   

715
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:32,933
Where did you come from?

716
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,633
What's happening now?

717
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:41,100
- But, how… 
 - I said, what is it?

718
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:45,767
Ta-da!

719
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:49,167
It's not just any lake.

720
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:53,033
The sunset view here is amazing, it really is!

721
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:57,467
That's why I reserved this place a long time ago, really.

722
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,833
Come and see, it's awesome. Look at this.

723
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,000
Why did you reserve it?

724
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,833
Why leave the motel you love so much?

725
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,733
That…

726
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:15,933
Have you seen the movie "Troy"?

727
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:21,667
In that movie, the gods envy humans.

728
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,000
Do you know why?

729
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,733
Because gods can't die.

730
01:02:25,733 --> 01:02:30,133
That's why death is alluring.

731
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,000
Are you dying?

732
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,467
No, it's just that… Hey, won't you die?

733
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:39,467
Jeez!

734
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:42,033
No, everyone dies eventually.

735
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:44,700
Life has meaning because of death. Right?

736
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,833
It's alluring, even romantic, exactly.

737
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,600
Romantic Mr. Chun Pil,

738
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,500
what's the diagnosis?

739
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,767
Cancer.

740
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:36,200
Kang Hee.

741
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,600
Kang Hee, I'll explain everything.

742
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,533
- Wait, let me talk… 
 - Don't say a word.

743
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:41,100
You knew everything.

744
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,233
What Chun Pil's illness is and what that medicine is.

745
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,967
You both went to the hospital together. Right?

746
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:50,900
That receipt was Chun Pil's, wasn't it?

747
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,133
You kept it from me and checked out a nursing home together?

748
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:55,600
What on earth were you two thinking?

749
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,933
Am I really nothing? Not even a daughter?

750
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,733
Don't follow me.

751
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:07,600
Just keep taking care of him as you've been doing.

752
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,733
Get out.

753
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:17,467
You won't get out?

754
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:22,970
♫  There, indifferent as the clouds  ♫

755
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:30,330
♫  Let go of your heart  ♫

756
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:39,750
♫  Those beautiful memories  ♫

757
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:48,760
♫  We made under the golden hour lights  ♫

758
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:57,767
♫  When they become submerged under the dark sea  ♫

759
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:02,433
   

760
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:09,030
♫  I won't recognize us  ♫

761
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:17,840
♫  An endless deep, darkness is left  ♫

762
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:25,010
   

763
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:28,010
 You're selling the motel? 

764
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:32,310
 It's time for Motel California, who kept us warm 

765
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:34,390
 to leave us now. 

766
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,610
 I'm going to have a daughter that resembles you, later. 

767
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:39,680
 You have to raise her with me. Just like how you raised me. 

768
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,400
 You raised me so well.  

769
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,210
 I thought you would always be by my side, 

770
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,840
 as an annoyance and bother. 

771
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,340
 What if Chun Pil dies, Yeon Soo? 

772
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:54,940
 Chun Pil, are you sick because of me?
