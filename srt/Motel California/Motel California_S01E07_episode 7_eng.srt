1
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:31,050


2
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
   

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,300
- Kwon? 
 - Yes.

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,567
Has there been any contact from Kang Hee?

5
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:43,033
A little while ago, she went up with ice cream.

6
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,400
- Kang Hee is here? 
 - Yes.

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,100
What's with the ice cream? She's not a child.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,867
What about me? Did she bring any for me?

9
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,267
What?

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,000
So, Kang Hee has returned.

11
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,767
Why?

12
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,467
Wait.

13
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,933
Is this Kang Hee's?

14
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,667
Ji Chun Pil's daughter, Ji Kang Hee.

15
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,267
Open the door, please.

16
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,833
- Hide! Hide! 
 - Huh?

17
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,600
I told you to hide!

18
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,933
 Welcome drink prepared wholeheartedly for my daughter. 

19
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,767
Home sweet home.

20
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,533
Open the door, will you, Kang Hee?

21
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,333
No, does it have to be now?

22
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:08,433
Please open the door. Your welcome drink has arrived.

23
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:12,500
 It's a beautiful day. Please open the door. 

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,560
Welcome to your sweet home!

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,800
This was your dad's dream.

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,633
A thoughtful dad dedicating this to his daughter.

27
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,667
It's locked.

28
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:32,633
 - Kang Hee, did you see the flowers in the vase?  
 - Yes.

29
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:36,167
While walking along the path,

30
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,833
 I found the wildflowers so beautiful, so I brought them for you. 

31
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,867
I just put them there for you…

32
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,833
Won't you open the door?

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,933
I'll go out.

34
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,500
Go out, where to? I'm outside now.

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,033
- I'll go out. 
 - Oh, my head.

36
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:55,567
Ah, sorry. I'm sorry, are you okay?

37
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,933
What's going on in your room?

38
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,933
 What could be there? How can you come unannounced like this? 

39
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,767
 How do you know who I'd be with? How can you just show up like this? 

40
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,200
- Were you with someone? 
 -  No.

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,333
It's not that I'm with someone, but what if I had been?

42
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
Ms. Kang Hee.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,267
- You should've told me you were coming. 
 - Were you with someone?

44
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:13,633
No!

45
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,867
Long time no see!

46
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,800
My goodness?

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,533
 Why is everyone coming to my room? 

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,900
Dad's like this, you know.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,067
The two of you talk comfortably.

50
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,267
Thank you.

51
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,767
My room is here. Yes.

52
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,800
Please go in and talk.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,067
- Yes. 
 - Yes, yes.

54
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,700
- Please go in. 
 - Then, I'll take a look at your room…

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,860
Let's go down and talk.

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,430
Ah, come quickly.

57
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,000
- He said go in… 
 - Where would you go uninvited?

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is driving me crazy.

59
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:01,500
How could you make me hear from someone else that you're back in town?

60
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,267
People will think it's weird that your boyfriend doesn't know about these things.

61
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,933
 - Daughter. 
 - Why? 

62
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,900
 Hide! Hide! 

63
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,633
Why did I do that?

64
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:22,133
Right? You'll reflect on it, won't you?

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,233
I understand.

66
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,467
You wanted to give me a surprise, didn't you?

67
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,433
Will he be angry?

68
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,067
Don't worry, I'm not angry.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,860
Ms. Kang Hee.

70
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,260
Yes?

71
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:46,300
It's like the mood has changed a bit.

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,967
What has changed, exactly?

73
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,700
You've said all you had to, right?

74
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,867
See you tomorrow.

75
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,900
 Can you be friends with me? 

76
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,700
 I don't want to. 

77
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,533
You went out.

78
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,700
Yes. I was just about to call.

79
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,333
Why?

80
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:46,967
You first, you called.

81
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,733
Shall we meet for a moment?

82
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,267
Shall we?

83
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,000
Now?

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,667
Now.

85
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,167
See you on the rooftop.

86
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,280
   

87
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:43,267
Can you be just friends with me?

88
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,367
- You can't, right? 
 - No, I can.

89
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,233
No. If you had thought of me as just a friend,

90
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,667
why did you tell me to hide when your father came?

91
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,433
You could just say we ate ice cream together.

92
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,533
For fear of being misunderstood.

93
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,167
Okay, let's say that's the case.

94
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,700
But you and I can't be friends. We even kissed.

95
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,567
So what if we kissed once, does that make us something?

96
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,500
- How old-fashioned. 
 - You don't feel any way about the kiss?

97
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
You were the one who kissed, not me.

98
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,242
You liked it too, didn't you?

99
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,100
You clung to it, saying it was good, and even embraced me.

100
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,467
What? Then, what is that?

101
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,091
- I don't remember. 
 - You don't remember?

102
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:22,625
So, do you remember everything every time you do it?

103
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,358
Every time?

104
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,820
You must have done it a lot, huh?

105
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:30,585
Of course.

106
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,967
Don't tell me you haven't done it once since then.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,567
That time?

108
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,667
You remember that.

109
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,367
Honestly,

110
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:56,448
if I had known you'd leave me, I wouldn't have slept with you then.

111
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,100
Kang Hee,

112
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,900
was it nothing to you?

113
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,433
To me, it's a memory I'll cherish for a lifetime.

114
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,600
Was it so insignificant and trivial to you?

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,625
Who said it was nothing?

116
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,092
It was my first time, too.

117
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,137
But what about it? After all this time.

118
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:21,367
Once the construction is over, I'll leave Hana-eup.

119
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,967
And you'll live in this godforsaken place for the rest of your life.

120
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,193
I can leave now.

121
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:28,618
If you're fine with it, I can follow you anywhere.

122
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,043
I've told you so many times.

123
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,976
But you didn't come.

124
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,000
After agreeing to go to Seoul with me,

125
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,533
you made me go alone.

126
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,100
You're right.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,233
I'm sorry for that.

128
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,867
Because I regretted that,

129
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,000
I kept trying to come to you.

130
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,800
But you're the one who cut off contact and pushed me away.

131
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't you think about my efforts?

132
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:09,633
Every time I barely reached out to you, you pushed me off the cliff.

133
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,433
Let's stop this.

134
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,167
It's all in the past.

135
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,533
It's all bothersome.

136
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,633
Okay.

137
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's stop this.

138
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,920
   

139
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,340
   

140
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,600
   

141
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,300
Cheon Yeon Soo!

142
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,200
Ma'am, I need to wait, right?

143
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,267
Yes, please wait a moment.

144
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,100
Huh? Unnie!

145
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,033
Ms. Nan Woo.

146
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,867
Director.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,433
How can you and Esther manage to still be friends?

148
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,400
Is this a situation of jealousy now? That kind of scenario?

149
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,067
I'm really just curious.

150
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:12,400
How can a man and a woman stay friends all their lives?

151
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,733
How do you do that?

152
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,233
- Was there never a crisis? 
 - A crisis?

153
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,833
Like, you both seeing each other as the opposite sex, for example?

154
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,833
Wow! Yes!

155
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,167
Kang Hee is finally starting to be curious about me.

156
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,400
No, that's not it…

157
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Ugh, never mind, pretend you didn't hear it.

158
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,233
It's something that can be misunderstood, but...

159
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,767
we're just real friends.

160
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,133
- Let's make it 45 millimeters. 
 - Yes.

161
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,900
You placed the order for Rimadyl, right?

162
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Ah, yes, I've checked it.

163
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,067
Next.

164
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,800
And…

165
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,433
Huh? Unnie?

166
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:05,167
I felt cold while passing by. Can I have a cup of tea before I go?

167
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,533
Oh, of course! Chamomile, right?

168
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,433
Yes.

169
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,567
You'll have some too, right, boss?

170
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
Drink it and go.

171
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,967
Boss, where are you going?

172
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:40,067
Veterinary visit.

173
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,700
Where's the visit to?

174
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,067
There were no reservations today.

175
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,790
He left his scarf behind.

176
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,560
He'll be cold.

177
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,933
Follow me to the rooftop.

178
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,733
Explain this.

179
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,467
Why are you giving this back to me again?

180
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,333
Are you disregarding someone's sincerity?

181
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,433
Give it to your boyfriend.

182
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,233
Stop right there.

183
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:51,667
If you don't accept this now, it's the end.

184
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,100
I won't be friends.

185
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,533
We're already over, aren't we?

186
00:15:56,533 --> 00:16:00,733
Wasn't it the end starting from when you dumped me at the hotel?

187
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,800
Are you taking revenge on me right now?

188
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,867
 Drink this and go back. 

189
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,730
 - Drink it and go.  
 - I sent you a purple message.

190
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,630
You gave me chamomile and just left.

191
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:18,467
 Give it to your girlfriend later. 

192
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:21,733
You're just mirroring the same wordsI said when I gave you the necklace.

193
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,700
Think whatever you want.

194
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,867
It's childish. So childish. Haven't you grown up at all?

195
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,067
Is it all about growing tall?

196
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,300
What about your heart not growing at all?

197
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,500
You weren't this childish even when you were younger.

198
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,133
You understood and accepted everything I did.

199
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,433
Mirroring.

200
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:49,600
Wow! Why is he like that, really?

201
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,400
 Manager. 

202
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,100
Yes, I'm coming.

203
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,167
Isn't it a bit different?

204
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,533
This wall has a different size from the blueprint?

205
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,533
 Manager. 

206
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,967
I'm coming.

207
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,167
The angle of this handrail doesn't match the original design.

208
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,133
 Manager. 

209
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,333
Almost there.

210
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,967
We need to select the electrical team before our team can enter.

211
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,400
Ah, my hands are shaking.

212
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,600
 - Manager. Manager, come out, over.  
 - Yes?

213
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,400
 To the first floor. 

214
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:48,167
Ms. Nan Woo called.

215
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,467
Unnie, a donkey is coming to our hospital.

216
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,567
We need to build a house urgently.

217
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,433
Could you help us?

218
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:02,267
Did Yeon Soo send you to ask me?

219
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,367
The director went to pick up the donkey.

220
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:09,133
I'm just asking you for a favor.

221
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,500
Director.

222
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,800
I heard you were building a house for the donkey. Can you do it alone?

223
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,667
Really. What do you think a large animal veterinarian is?

224
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:27,067
Building houses for migratory birds and enclosures for wild animals is our specialty.

225
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,400
I'll help you.

226
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,900
It's okay.

227
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,967
   

228
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,833
Many hands make light work.

229
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,467
You know, they say, practice makes perfect.

230
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:41,367
Contrary to what I thought, I'm accustomed to the construction site.

231
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't you think he'd be better than me?

232
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,333
I thought building houses for wild animals was your specialty.

233
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,067
What wild animals did you build houses for, ants?

234
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,833
And you said you were used to the site's meals, so it seems that's all you've had.

235
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,500
Besides, people can't build anthills.

236
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,867
Huh? Unnie!

237
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:37,567
What are you two doing right now?

238
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,460
They've been like that since earlier.

239
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,200
I wonder if they will end it today.

240
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,633
Wait! Did you cut that in the right size?

241
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,333
Hold on.

242
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,200
Did you cut this the wrong size?

243
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,667
We're already short on wood. What can we do if you mess it up like this?

244
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,867
You're really not helping.

245
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,233
No, there is plenty of wood.

246
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:02,467
Cheon Yeon Soo, you're going to build a fence. Right?

247
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,567
Let's go to the site together to load materials.

248
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,200
Never mind, it's late.

249
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,133
If Kang Hee does it, it'll be done quickly. Come with me.

250
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,467
You can't just let anyone into the construction site.

251
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,533
Car keys.

252
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,433
- Hurry up and give it to me. 
 - Hurry!

253
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,733
Please load this into the car.

254
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,933
- This one? 
 - Yes.

255
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,567
I'll do it. Load this up, please.

256
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,630
♫  There was some misunderstanding  ♫

257
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,067
Please install this here.

258
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Can you install this for me?

259
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,550
♫  ...it is an awkward attraction  ♫

260
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,400
♫  Why do I end up thinking of you every night?  ♫

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,040
♫  What's clear is I'm putting in a lot of effort for you  ♫

262

♫  What's clear is I'm putting in a lot of effort for you  ♫

263

264
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,060
♫  Shall the two of us walk together on a sunset evening?  ♫

265
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,750
♫  When the faded streetlights come on, I'll take you home  ♫

270
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,867
Now, everyone. It's completed.

271
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:21,167
Wow!

272
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:24,833
Can a designer do this kind of work, too?

273
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,467
You really made it well!

274
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,700
I learned it out on the field.

275
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,100
I wanted to build my own house.

276
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,267
You mean, building the house yourself?

277
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:36,833
I laid the bricks, made the window frames, and even did the tiling.

278
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:41,067
Cheon Yeon Soo, there's a room for you, too.

279
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,900
You asked me to make it.

280
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,867
My room?

281
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,900
Guest room.

282
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:53,633
Bring your wife and kids over to hang out or something.

283
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,667
We'll see, if my kids and wife agree.

284
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,167
You've worked hard.

285
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:11,333
Do you want to eat? I don't want to be indebted.

286
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,100
What should I do?

287
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,800
I have dinner plans.

288
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,633
Ah, that's right. We also made plans with Han Woo, didn't we?

289
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,533
Ah, yes.

290
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,267
That's too bad.

291
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,740
   

292
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,933
Sorry, but...

293
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,833
I have dinner plans.

294
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,533
Esther has already arrived?

295
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,567
How did you know?

296
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,533
It seems you have something to say to her.

297
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,867
Have a good meeting.

298
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,733
Shall we go together?

299
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:50,733
I'll pass today. You two can meet.

300
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:54,700
Aren't you jealous, not a bit? I'm meeting another woman.

301
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,100
I'll be jealous next time. I'm too tired today.

302
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,167
You promised. Be sure to be jealous next time. Just like I did earlier.

303
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:07,233
Why would he ask you to build his room in your house?

304
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,933
He doesn't even remember.

305
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,267
Really…

306
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,700
Oh my, is it already finished?

307
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,233
I came in a hurry to help.

308
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,967
Kang Hee.

309
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:23,500
I thought it was the work of a professional.

310
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,633
- Oh, what is it? 
 - Hey!

311
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:30,167
Stay away, it's dangerous. Don't touch it.

312
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,600
It's a skin disease.

313
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,733
We can't let it spread to the cows, can we?

314
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,733
Ah, that's right.

315
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,667
Oh dear, but it's smaller than I thought.

316
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,770
The crossbreed is usually small,

317
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,633
but this one is smaller, because it couldn't eat properly.

318
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:47,467
They said it was abandoned by the farm owner, right?

319
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,233
After it's fully treated, does it have a place to go?

320
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:52,500
He'll hear you.

321
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,870
He'll get anxious if we make plans to send him off.

322
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,760
He's already been abandoned once.

323
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,100
Then, what's its name?

324
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,267
It doesn't have one yet.

325
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:07,033
Its name should be given by the owner later.

326
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,867
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

327
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm not hungry.

328
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,233
Thank you.

329
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,000
Why is he like that again?

330
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,967
 Kang Hee, let's go! 

331
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:14,533
 Cheon Yeon Soo, come out! 

332
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,833
 I know you didn't go. 

333
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,967
 You draw too. 

334
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:56,433
 Can I come in, too? 

335
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
 Yes, come in. 

336
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,400
 I wish I had my own room. 

337
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
 Your house has many rooms. 

338
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,033
 Not that kind of room. 

339
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:17,800
 When I grow up, I'm going to live in a house like this. 

340
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,000
 With a room, a living room, 

341
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,500
 a kitchen, and even a yard. 

342
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,933
 I'll build it for you. 

343
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,467
 No, I'll build it. 

344
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,667
 You said you'll become a veterinarian. 

345
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,933
 When our cat gets sick, you'll have to treat it. 

346
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,467
 Then what about me? 

347
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:48,167
 Can I come over to your house? 

348
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:59,667
 I'll make a room for you, too. 

349
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,467
 Thank you. 

350
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:05,400
 Fool, teddy bear. 

351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,400
There were times when I was happy because of a friend.

352
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:18,800
Back then, a friend was all I needed.

353
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,700
And it was nice not having to confess.

354
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:32,767
It's good because we won't have to part ways,

355
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,033
and because we can see each other for life.

356
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:02,167
That's… because it's unrequited love, right?

357
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,733
No.

358
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:07,333
It's good because we're friends.

359
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,900
Excuse me.

360
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,667
- It's your first time at a place like this, right? 
 - Yeah.

361
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:14,990
Where shall we sit?

362
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,500
Do you come to places like this often?

363
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,233
Yes.

364
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,200
What's fresh today?

365
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,500
The sea squirts are fresh, and we've got spoon worms too.

366
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,000
Great! We'll take the sea squirts and spoon worms.

367
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,167
Do you have live octopus? And some octopus and tartare, too.

368
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,767
And the drinks?

369
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,333
Later.

370
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,467
Is this it? The spoon worms?

371
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:40,900
Are we supposed to eat this?

372
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,167
- Do we eat this? 
 - Huh?

373
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:46,200
Wow!

374
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,567
- You try it first. 
 - What?

375
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,767
I eat it all the time, you have some more.

376
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
This one?

377
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,033
Spit it out.

378
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,667
It's so delicious!

379
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,767
You try it, too.

380
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:23,300
No, you have more.

381
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,500
- Eat it, quick. 
 - No, I'm fine.

382
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,300
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

383
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,867
It's your turn now.

384
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,500
- What's wrong? 
 - What do you mean?

385
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,467
How long have I known you? Can't I tell just by looking at you?

386
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,133
What?

387
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,800
Is Victor causing you trouble?

388
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,567
We... are negotiating with "Fire Ball".

389
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,800
I didn't actually tell Victor, you know?

390
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,900
Is that why he's upset?

391
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,033
"Lyon" is transferring his shares.

392
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:07,167
Hey, not "Lyon". It means a hostile M&amp;A.

393
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,967
Exactly.

394
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,967
If we combine our shares, we can defend it. It's okay.

395
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,767
Don't tell me you've transferred your shares, too?

396
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,600
I'm going to sue.

397
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,160
They proceeded without asking for my opinion or consent,

398
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,430
so I can definitely reclaim it.

399
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,867
I felt I should tell you before you heard it from Lawyer Kim. That's all.

400
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,500
Esther,

401
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,333
this is nothing. You know that, right?

402
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,800
If needed, I can give you all my shares.

403
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,033
But let me ask you one thing.

404
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,867
Are you happy? With Victor?

405
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,533
I don't want you to suffer a loss because of me.

406
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
You didn't answer.

407
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm asking if you're happy.

408
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,933
Who is this woman?

409
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,433
Does Kang Hee know? That you two are meeting?

410
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,500
Are you by any chance Cheon Yeon Soo?

411
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:11,133
Yes. Who are you?

412
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,967
I've heard a lot about you from Seok Kyeong.

413
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,933
No, why talk about me…

414
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:23,867
Ah, I don't do blind dates. I don't do blind dates.

415
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,967
I don't do them either.

416
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,167
No, I can't.

417
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,933
I'm married...

418
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,300
and pregnant.

419
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,533
Really? Is it true?

420
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,933
Yes.

421
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,633
What? You're not going to congratulate me?

422
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,333
Congratulations.

423
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,833
Congratulations!

424
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,533
Thank you!

425
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,033
Esther, are you really becoming a mother?

426
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:58,767
I wanted to tell my best friend first.

427
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,400
But you heard it, too.

428
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,467
Congratulations to you.

429
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
- So, you two… 
 - We are friends.

430
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,667
We also work together.

431
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Well… I'm also really close with Kang Hee.

432
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,433
Here.

433
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,367
   

434
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,333
"Park" of Golden Gilt Studio.

435
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,333
Park Esther.

436
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,767
"Hwang" is the boss, "Geum" is…

437
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,600
"Ji" is Kang Hee.

438
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Hence, Golden Gilt. 
    

439
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,433
I'll go first.

440
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,967
It was nice to meet you. See you next time.

441
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,267
Let's go together.

442
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:49,867
Nonsense.

443
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,767
It's fine.

444
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,867
Call me when you arrive.

445
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,600
Please, go.

446
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,667
Since when have you two been friends?

447
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:18,433
If you're curious, let's have another drink together.

448
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:26,467
I never imagined I'd live in the countryside,

449
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,867
but it's fun.

450
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,600
Why? Because of Kang Hee.

451
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,300
Everything is fun when done with Kang Hee.

452
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,600
It's all fun.

453
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,433
I suppose so.

454
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:42,100
What man in the world?

455
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,600
What man wouldn't like Kang Hee?

456
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,267
What?

457
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,133
That's different.

458
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:53,633
I will do everything Kang Hee asks me.

459
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,700
I'll do anything Kang Hee wants.

460
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:03,633
Who can't be nice when they are by your side?

461
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,200
Even when not beside you,

462
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,120
always thinking of you and being nice,

463
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,200
that's what truly being nice is.

464
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,767
Have you been to Jogye Temple in Seoul?

465
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,400
How about Bongeun Temple?

466
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
As for me, when I go there,

467
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,567
I'm the person who always lights a candle for Kang Hee's health.

468
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:26,567
Or maybe… Myeongdong Cathedral!

469
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,500
When I go to Myeongdong Cathedral,

470
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,033
I pray for Kang Hee's happiness, too.

471
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:35,267
I'm the person who visits each church to make offerings, that's me.

472
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,600
No, why would Kang Hee's happiness

473
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,858
be outsourced to Buddha, Virgin Mary, or God?

474
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:45,625
I am...

475
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:50,233
going to make her happy myself.

476
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:54,033
What do you know about Kang Hee to make her happy?

477
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:57,733
You shouldn't know about Kang Hee,

478
00:35:57,733 --> 00:36:01,033
because Kang Hee dislikes men who know her past.

479
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,467
So, Cheon Yeon Soo

480
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,967
is out of the game.

481
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,300
I...

482
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:14,367
have known Kang Hee since we were young, but...

483
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,833
do you know how many years it's been since Kang Hee went to Seoul and I haven't seen her?

484
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,133
Even I don't know Kang Hee.

485
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,033
I don't know. You think I know, but I don't.

486
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:29,133
So with that in mind, I say I win. Me!

487
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:32,867
Let's wait and see who wins.

488
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,867
Hey! Han Woo, why?

489
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,133
Who is it?

490
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,133
- My friend… 
 - Hello?

491
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,900
- What are you doing? 
 - Who's this?

492
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,567
I said, my friend, Han Woo.

493
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:46,800
Hey, I'm busy, talk later.

494
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:48,933
Isn't that a woman?

495
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:50,533
Seems like you're talking to another woman right now?

496
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:52,433
A man! Obviously a man!

497
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:55,100
It was clearly a woman just now!

498
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,167
I am speechless.

499
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,700
Good morning!

500
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,067
Good morning!

501
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:04,833
- Good morning. 
 - Oh, uh?

502
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,167
What about Director Geum?

503
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,100
Hasn't he come yet?

504
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,233
No, he's not answering the phone.

505
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:12,100
I will try it.

506
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,233
- Ah, what? 
 - What!

507
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,100
- What? 
 - What is this?

508
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,600
- What's this? What's this? 
 - Why are you here, Mr. Cheon Yeon Soo?

509
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,900
Who should be asking that?

510
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,733
Yesterday, we definitely met by chance, greeted each other and parted.

511
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:03,467
It wasn't that. We had a drink together.

512
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,767
I must have made no mistake.

513
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,367
I know, I know. And I haven't made any mistakes either.

514
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:11,600
That…

515
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,433
I can't remember what we did yesterday at all. Or what was said.

516
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,900
I completely blanked out, too.

517
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,200
Why am I the only one undressed?

518
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,300
 I will properly confess to Ms. Kang Hee. 

519
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,800
 That I can do anything with her. 

520
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:35,833
 So, keep being Yeon Soo the friend, 

521
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:39,433
 and watch from the sidelines. 

522
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:44,433
 So, brother, the conclusion is, 

523
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:49,067
 the person who will be with Kang Hee for life is me. 

524
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:53,400
 If you and her date and then break up, 

525
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,667
 you become strangers. The end, it's over. 

526
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:01,833
 So after all is said and done, money is the best… 

527
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:05,667
 Sworn friends are the best, okay? 

528
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,133
I remember now.

529
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,067
You are Kang Hee's

530
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,467
sworn friend, right?

531
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,767
If you're Kang Hee's friend, you're my friend, too.

532
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,533
Let's get along well.

533
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,300
 Keep friends close… 

534
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,433
Ah, my head hurts.

535
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,833
 And enemies closer. 

536
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,533
See you.

537
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
You're not leaving?

538
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,467
Let's go to the construction site together. Because I have something to tell Kang Hee.

539
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Is that so?

540
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,633
Let's go.

541
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,233
Haven't you seen the director?

542
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,667
Hasn't he come to work today?

543
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:08,633
- I called, but someone else answered. 
 - Another person?

544
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:11,333
It was clearly the director's phone.

545
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,200
"This is Geum Seok Kyeong." That's what they said.

546
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:24,300
You two were together.

547
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:26,800
Ms. Kang Hee,

548
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Yeon Soo has something to tell you.

549
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,533
Did you drink? Both of you?

550
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:47,967
Kang Hee.

551
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,267
Kang Hee, we…

552
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,633
Let's be friends.

553
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:04,933
I saw him with someone named Esther yesterday.

554
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,233
It looked nice.

555
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,567
Ah, it looks so good.

556
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:23,200
Let's go through life together, as friends.

557
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,700
Okay?

558
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,767
Welcome.

559
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,367
Ms. Yoon Nan Woo?

560
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,667
Yes, it's me.

561
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,867
Goodbye.

562
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:55,800
   

563
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,867
The director?

564
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,767
I didn't know the director had this side.

565
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:05,500
Did Yeon Soo really give this to you?

566
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,567
You said you were coming for advice, but you came to show off?

567
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,133
It wasn't just a bouquet, there were also concert tickets.

568
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,867
It is a boast, indeed.

569
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:23,133
It's not going to be free.

570
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,800
Buy me a meal.

571
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:29,367
Do you know the title of the performance?

572
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:31,067
What is it?

573
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,533
   

574
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:41,633
Hey, isn't this a proposal?

575
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:45,567
Exactly.

576
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,700
Why are you reacting like this?

577
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,233
The director… You know he had a crush on Kang Hee, right?

578
00:42:54,967 --> 00:43:00,267
But he recently gave up on that. Very recently.

579
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:02,567
Could it be the director…

580
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:06,800
In a fit of anger, "oh well, whatever", and bam!

581
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,300
I might cause a scene.

582
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:16,400
What if I am that "anyone"?

583
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:18,833
Nan Woo,

584
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,833
Yeon Soo is not like that.

585
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:25,367
After dating all this time, you don't know what kind of person Yeon Soo is?

586
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:31,233
Actually…

587
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,200
Did you hear anything from the director, by any chance?

588
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,000
Hey, with such a clear confession, what else do you need to confirm?

589
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,433
Is that so?

590
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,133
Don't worry.

591
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:51,433
Ugh, I can't listen to this out of jealousy.

592
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:54,033
I'm going out first. Take your time.

593
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:09,633
Hello!

594
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,433
- Yes, hello! 
 - Hello!

595
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:13,167
Why did you bring so much?

596
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:14,800
Just a moment.

597
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:21,367
- What's the occasion? 
 - Field trip.

598
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:23,967
Why here?

599
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:27,367
This is the real world. This is the real deal.

600
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,633
Tastes… delicious.

601
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,300
Yeon Soo gave flowers to Nan Woo.

602
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:49,967
Yeon Soo too, and even Kang Hee.

603
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:54,033
I do get jealous that everyone is dating.

604
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:00,233
Ah, right. You have to work, don't you? I'm going now.

605
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:02,100
You should do it, too.

606
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,533
You have a lot of blind dates.

607
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,033
Mom, why aren't you answering the phone?

608
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,333
Huh? Wait, the phone?

609
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,933
Did you really send it? A bouquet to Ms. Yoon?

610
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:46,667
Did she get it? Isn't it pretty?

611
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,433
I spent some money.

612
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:50,100
Why did you do that? I told you not to.

613
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,900
Oh, really.

614
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,267
At times like this, it makes me wonder if you're really my son.

615
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,033
How can you not understand the heart of a woman?

616
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:01,667
You two just need to score a goal in marriage now.

617
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:05,867
There's no goalkeeper. You just have to kick it and it's a goal.

618
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:07,733
Why don't you do it?

619
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:11,300
Just let Yeon Soo take care of it himself.

620
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,300
The kid just outright hates the idea.

621
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,080
No, they did the dating on their own.

622
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,100
I have to help with the marriage.

623
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,767
No one has the experience I do when it comes to marriage.

624
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:25,700
There's a reason companies prefer experienced people.

625
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:29,933
You got the play tickets, right?

626
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:32,000
You can propose at the performance.

627
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,567
What?

628
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:35,500
Ah, don't be nervous.

629
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,733
After the play, when they call your names, just the two of you go out.

630
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:41,400
You just have to do as they say.

631
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,200
- No, Mom! 
 - Yeon Soo.

632
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,633
I can't get married before you again, can I?

633
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:51,300
You have to do it quickly. So I can, too.

634
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,800
Again? Hey, you're doing it again?

635
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,567
I mean, there's someone I'm interested in.

636
00:46:57,567 --> 00:47:01,233
If I like what you do, I'll ask for a proposal like that, too.

637
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:03,767
Hey! Then, you'd have to request the story.

638
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:05,367
I don't know.

639
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeon Soo!

640
00:47:10,033 --> 00:47:12,467
You're only a mother by name?

641
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:15,100
How do you just keep on getting married without a break?

642
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,367
There must be someone out there...

643
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:21,567
who doesn't wander and only likes me.

644
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,267
Are you looking for something?

645
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:27,900
Ah, um… some flowers…

646
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,233
I'm thinking of buying…

647
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:35,467
Just give me the most expensive ones.

648
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,667
For your girlfriend?

649
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,967
No, it's not.

650
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,567
- I'll help you with the payment. 
 - Yes.

651
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:54,200
   

652
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:25,750
♫  Sometimes, when you spare me a gaze  ♫

653
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:32,440
♫  as if it's a part of your every day  ♫

654
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:40,633
♫  Without a word, you grab my hands  ♫

655
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:42,267
Unnie!

656
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,533
Is it your birthday?

657
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:48,300
No.

658
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,367
Isn't it heavy?

659
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:50,867
It's okay.

660
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:54,267
It's the first gift from the director. I want to take it home myself.

661
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,933
Cheon Yeon Soo?

662
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,500
The flowers?

663
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,733
Uh! Okay, then.

664
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,900
Carry it carefully.

665
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:18,990
♫  Please smile for me, I don't need anything else  ♫

666
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:25,260
♫  Let me fill my eyes with you  ♫

667
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:31,840
♫  Yes, please tell me, though my heart is still full  ♫

668
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,560
♫  of love for you  ♫

669
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:41,570
   

670
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,133
What are you doing?

671
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:55,567
For me?

672
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,600
Ah Reum.

673
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,600
Or just throw it away.

674
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:17,300
♫  I'm just full of fleeting worries, 
 so I'll just ask just in case  ♫

675
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:26,167
- Is this your first time seeing a bouquet? 
 - Who are you giving it to?

676
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:29,633
I received it, from a man.

677
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,167
Hey!

678
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,400
Cheon Yeon Soo,

679
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,600
you never bought me flowers even once.

680
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,267
You don't like flowers, do you?

681
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:44,033
That's not true. I really like flowers.

682
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,033
- Should I buy them? 
 - No.

683
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,967
It's too late.

684
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:50,667
Just buy them.

685
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:53,167
I will report it to Yoon Nan Woo right away.

686
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,600
I can't even buy flowers for a friend?

687
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,333
Of course.

688
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:15,200
Before starting the exterior work, please reinforce the scaffolding first.

689
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,533
Safety comes first.

690
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:18,567
Oh, my! Rest assured.

691
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:21,700
Everything will be ready before the person in charge arrives.

692
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,500
Have a safe trip.

693
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,867
I will go to the headquarters for the meeting and come back tomorrow.

694
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:28,300
Okay. Understood.

695
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,067
You heard? Scaffolding reinforcement work.

696
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,567
- Yes. 
 - Of course.

697
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,000
All right, let's go then.

698
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,967
- The car keys. 
 - Ah.

699
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,967
- Take care. 
 - Ah, then work hard.

700
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:43,890
   

701
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,040
   

702
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,200
What is this?

703
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,600
Let's just ride quietly.

704
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,267
- Hey! 
 - It's not like I sat where I wanted, okay?

705
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:24,633
This was the only seat available.

706
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,367
Seatbelt.

707
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,833
Let's just talk to each other on the way.

708
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,667
What did you say?

709
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:50,267
I said let's just talk on the way.

710
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,667
Is it okay to talk among friends?

711
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:55,500
I'll allow it.

712
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:04,233
Why are you going to Seoul?

713
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,867
Just have some things to sort out, and you?

714
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:09,833
My home has always been in Seoul.

715
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,167
And my company is also in Seoul.

716
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,733
How's life in Seoul?

717
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,400
Right now, well… it's good.

718
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,367
 Because of that guy? 

719
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:29,600
Until I joined this company, it was really…

720
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,867
What, how was it?

721
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:34,200
It was like cursed hardtack.

722
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,400
Hardtack?

723
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,100
Yeah.

724
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,300
Do you remember the hardtack man?

725
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,033
Yes, I remember.

726
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,700
   

727
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,567
We used to worry about it all the time.

728
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:54,700
Worried the hardtack would get moist during the rainy season.

729
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,100
Worried it would collect dust during the sand storm season.

730
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,200
Worried it wouldn't sell in the midsummer.

731
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,000
And then worried in the dead of winter that the man's hands would be cold.

732
00:54:10,233 --> 00:54:12,333
Life in Seoul is like that.

733
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Like rainy season hardtack,

734
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,633
like summer hardtack, like winter hardtack.

735
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:01,367
What does it matter, among friends?

736
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,567
No, I didn't sleep.

737
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:08,500
You slept!

738
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,767
Thought you were headbanging.

739
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,367
Yeah, I slept.

740
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:16,700
I owe you one.

741
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,633
What? Should I compensate you?

742
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Sure.

743
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,867
With what?

744
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:25,800
A tour of Seoul.

745
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,367
Please, do it for me.

746
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:33,000
Ma'am, please come down carefully.

747
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:37,467
- Over here! 
 - Oh dear, thank you.

748
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,000
Not at all. Please go inside carefully.

749
00:55:44,067 --> 00:55:45,733
Is there a place you want to visit?

750
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,233
Golden Gilt.

751
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:49,333
Our company?

752
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,467
Why there?

753
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:51,967
You said you have to go to the company anyway.

754
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:55,633
That's me, but you should go where you want to visit.

755
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:58,433
I'm curious about how my friend works.

756
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:00,400
Is that not possible?

757
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,100
All right, let's go.

758
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,400
But, can friends take the subway together?

759
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,920
Do what's comfortable.

760
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,060
Shall we part here and meet again later?

761
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,733
It's fine.

762
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:23,100
The subway in Seoul is incredibly complicated.

763
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,233
Just follow me closely.

764
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:31,133
- Why aren't you coming? 
 - It's convenient to transfer here.

765
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,667
On 5-2.

766
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,133
   

767
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,300
Did you wait long?

768
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:53,500
So this is where my friend works.

769
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,033
You should have waited in the coffee shop on the first floor.

770
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:59,633
It was fun watching people.

771
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:04,467
Ah, I'm hungry.

772
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:06,100
Shall we eat?

773
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,433
Is it okay to eat alone with a friend?

774
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:11,633
Then, should we eat separately?

775
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:13,767
Let's eat and then meet up again.

776
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,033
Hold this for me, please.

777
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:49,867
No, I can't.

778
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,233
What?

779
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:53,367
Don't you know the perilla leaf debate?

780
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:57,067
Han Woo has strictly defined friendships.

781
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,933
But both of you have the same opinion.

782
00:57:59,933 --> 00:58:01,533
So, it's not possible.

783
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:04,100
Got a death wish?

784
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:08,933
You… Are you more afraid of Han Woo?

785
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:11,000
Or are you more afraid of me?

786
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:40,133
Hey, between friends, can you debone the fi…

787
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,833
It must be delicious.

788
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:51,733
I'm good at this because my knowledge of animals is extensive.

789
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:53,767
Fish are vertebrates.

790
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,800
This spine, that is where the backbone is located.

791
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,567
And also this fin…

792
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,600
Eat.

793
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,300
Let's eat.

794
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:15,033
It's delicious.

795
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:58,233
Want to come over and see my place?

796
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:01,133
- Your house? 
 - Yes.

797
01:00:01,133 --> 01:00:02,800
It's right over there.

798
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,267
Can't we have a housewarming among friends?

799
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,933
Cheon Yeon Soo,

800
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,233
come on up.

801
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:23,800
Okay.

802
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,833
Come in.

803
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:41,233
Here.

804
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:47,867
It's mine, right?

805
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:49,567
Yes.

806
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,767
How is it?

807
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:08,633
I don't know what others would think,

808
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:14,267
but I've been living in goshiwons and semi-basement apartments...

809
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:16,933
for the past ten years...

810
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,567
to get here.

811
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:25,500
I've really lived diligently.

812
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,167
Really diligently.

813
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:34,167
That's why I really wanted to show this place to you.

814
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:50,033
Why?

815
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,800
What?

816
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,300
You've worked hard, Ji Kang Hee.

817
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:14,267
Overcoming summer's hardtack, monsoon's hardtack, and winter's hardtack.

818
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You've made it here.

819
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:28,633
Wow, that's amazing!

820
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,033
My friend, Kang Hee.

821
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,290
Yeon Soo,

822
01:03:07,435 --> 01:03:09,802
is it okay for friends to kiss?

823
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:27,920
♫  Close your eyes and feel me here  ♫

824
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:35,060
♫  What color is in your mind?  ♫

825
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:41,390
♫  Blue, dark gray, calm and sweet  ♫

826
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:47,240
♫  I can give you all  ♫

827
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:54,000
♫  Please tell me if you're standing here for me  ♫

828
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,260
   

829
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:05,000
♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

830
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,380
♫  Here I am  ♫

831
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,230
♫  Where I stand  ♫

832
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:18,690


833
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:22,470
   

834
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,010
 Did the two of them... leave? Together? 

835
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,510
 - Ugh, you teddy bear. 
 - Do you want to sleep with me? 

836
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:29,550
 Why are you playing with my feelings? 

837
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,920
 Did you sleep well? 

838
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,930
 Crazy, crazy. I shouldn't have.  

839
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:33,980
 How could you not contain yourself? 

840
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:36,680
 Kang Hee, you're having a blast aren't you? 

841
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,740
 Who knows when you'll lose your cool! 

842
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,970
 What about now? 

843
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,080
 We received a construction suspension notice. 

844
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,810
 Just send Kang Hee back to Seoul. 

845
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:46,790
 Why do you go to such lengths to hate Kang Hee? 

846
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,390
 She's that woman's daughter. 

847
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,390
 The woman that seduced and killed your dad. 

848
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,320
 Let's do it.  

849
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,360
 I'm not going to be friends with Kang Hee anymore.
