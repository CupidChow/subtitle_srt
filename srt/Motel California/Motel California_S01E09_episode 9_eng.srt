1
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:34,210


2
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:01,533
Let's date.

3
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,767
Are you sure?

4
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes. From now on, I'll only look and think only of you.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,233
All this time, I've lived hoping that everyone around me would be happy.

6
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,767
From now on, I'll give up all my desires,

7
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,833
and only make you happy.

8
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:26,000
I've always had someone by my side.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,200
But you've always been alone.

10
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,233
From now on, I'll never let go of your hand again.

11
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,800
   

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm back.

13
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,033
Did something good happen?

14
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,400
What could have happened?

15
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:35,133
 ♪ Do you know ♪ 

16
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,533
 ♪ The white thing attached to the tangerine is called ♪ 

17
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,033
 ♪ Tangerine pith ♪ 

18
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,467
What should I do?

19
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,500
We have prepared a premium yacht event.

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,290
It's a hotel event.

21
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,530
We have prepared a drone show.

22
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,567
How about some fireworks?

23
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,600
As you can see, we were invited to the World Firework Festival

24
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,900
after recognition of our skills…

25
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,600
It's a countryside village that still gets complaints about noise,

26
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,400
and the leaders of that village go to bed early at night.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,533
Considering local characteristics, we will make another proposal.

28
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:30,933
Yes, as soon as possible.

29
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:36,300
I would like to request an event that can demonstrate a more extensive influence.

30
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,200
   

31
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,800
   

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Kang Hee!

33
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,133
Thank you.

34
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:02,400
You wanted to see me so badly, you came out early, didn't you?

35
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Of course, I wanted to see you.

36
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,433
I wanted to see you more.

37
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,767
Why? Is something wrong?

38
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,733
I think I've messed everything up again.

39
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,733
What did you mess up?

40
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,300
I should have told you earlier,

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,367
but I ended up accepting the necklace.

42
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,233
What necklace?

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,900
 I'll cover up the nonsense that troubles you with my own rumors. 

44
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,300
 I'm still your official boyfriend, aren't I? 

45
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,767
 But you're not my real boyfriend. 

46
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,133
 There's no reason for me to accept something like this. 

47
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,367
 You seem to be under a misconception. 

48
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,467
 I'm doing my job right now. 

49
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,200
 Getting the construction to start again, 

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,667
 and making sure the person in charge can work in the best condition, 

51
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,433
 is my duty after all. 

52
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:58,667
 Here. It's for the construction, so take it, quickly. 

53
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:01,233
 If it is really burdensome, you can return it after the construction is over. 

54
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:05,233
 Do you think receiving the necklace will cover up the rumors and solve the issue? 

55
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,400
 I have it all planned out. 

56
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,500
 Let's cooperate for the construction. 

57
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,767
 If you're the person in charge, act like one. 

58
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,580
 If we can just resume the construction, 

59
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,600
 I could even accept ten of these necklaces. 

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
 Give it to me. 

61
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,433
 They say you'll grab the straws if you're drowning. 

62
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:25,400
 Does this look like a straw to you? 

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
 Or do I look like a straw to you? 

64
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,933
 I'll make sure to clear up the rumors before we resume construction, 

65
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,667
 so brighten up your face! 

66
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,033
Cheon Yeon Soo, are you laughing?

67
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,167
I thought you'd say something serious.

68
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:54,400
You took it because of work, it means you have nothing to do with that man.

69
00:05:56,633 --> 00:06:00,000
That's a relief, it's not too late.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,067
It's already too late!

71
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:04,267
You've been really pretentious all this time, haven't you?

72
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:07,867
Even if I spout nonsense about wanting to be friends or whatever in the future,

73
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,900
catch on quickly that it's all a bluff.

74
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,967
When I say "don't follow me," if you really don't follow,

75
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:17,200
and when I tell you to go away, if you just go away,

76
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,810
I'll kill you!

77
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,167
Do you feel wronged?

78
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,367
Are you dumbfounded?

79
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,700
No.

80
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,033
Your lips are so pretty when you're angry like this.

81
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:31,433
I can't hear anything but look at them.

82
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:43,167
Keep talking. Speak more.

83
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,533
Even if there's a rumor going around that I'm getting married,

84
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,933
don't believe such things.

85
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,920
And if I say that things are tough

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,033
and talk about "throwing the towel or quitting,"

87
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,533
don't be swayed by that.

88
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,367
From today, we're starting day one.

89
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,300
No.

90
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,500
When the director returns, I'll return the necklace.

91
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,733
Let's start over from then.

92
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,760
Completely, without any fault.

93
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,533
Do I have to wait again?

94
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:26,033
Don't worry, he'll be right back.

95
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,300
Okay.

96
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
Then, until that time, let's just keep it casual.

97
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,267
What's that?

98
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,300
It's a date proposal.

99
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,133
It's warm.

100
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,067
- Is it warm? 
 - Yes.

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,133
Oh? It's a shooting star!

102
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,233
- Where? 
 - Over there!

103
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,233
Did you make a wish? Wish!

104
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,900
I was kidding.

105
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,233
♫  Please be my forest, embrace me  ♫

106
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,367
Look at the damaged skin texture.

107
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,667
I need to take care of it.

108
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,620
♫  and embrace your tender heart   ♫

109
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,000
It's become firm.

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,033
Good! Good!

111
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Good morning!

112
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,333
Where are you going?

113
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,367
A date, perhaps?

114
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,367
What date?

115
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,667
What's so noisy?

116
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,867
I didn't say anything.

117
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,200
Me neither.

118
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,133
I didn't say anything either.

119
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,033
No, it's vibrating.

120
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,600
- The phone is ringing, isn't it? 
 - Really!

121
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,833
   

122
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,933
Ah, my neck hurts.

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,533
Yes, director.

124
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,100
Right now?

125
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,110
To where?

126
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,890
   

127
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,833
Try going over there.

128
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,567
It's pretty, isn't it?

129
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,733
This way.

130
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,867
- Miss! 
 - Miss!

131
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,267
- You can go this way. 
 - You can go this way.

132
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:11,633
You can go this way.

133
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,167
Hello! Which way?

134
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,367
Shall we go this way?

135
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,700
They say the song has started, the song.

136
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,400
No, I want to go.

137
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,333
Ah, I want to go.

138
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,433
Ah, I need to go.

139
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,667
Wait a minute.

140
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,433
Come with me.

141
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,333
Kang Hee, what's all this in Hana-eup?

142
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey, that's too cool!

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,133
Thanks to you, I'm living it up! I'm really enjoying it!

144
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm envious!

145
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,767
Kang Hee, I won the latest model TV! Thank you!

146
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,090
   

147
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,310
♫  There might be tear filled compassion  ♫

148

♫  Even so, if you  ♫

157

Don't. Please, don't.

158
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:15,233
Don't! Don't!

159

 Take it! 

160

Mr. Geum Seok Kyeong's proposal event for Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

161
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,233
No one missed it, right?

162
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,167
It doesn't happen every day, after all.

163
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,100
Don't forget and make sure to participate.

164
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,600
Watch a show, have a party, and enjoy delicious food.

165
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,433
This is all thanks to our hotel heir.

166
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,300
Young and rich, tall and handsome Geum Seok Kyeong.

167
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,967
Are you sure this was planned recently?

168
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,533
It seems like it took months to prepare.

169
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,200
This is an event prepared personally for Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

170
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,233
Should I say it's the power of money?

171
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,267
The work does get done rather quickly.

172
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:59,800
Indeed, the scale of an heir is hugely different, right?

173
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,067
Thank you.

174
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Hello, can I please have your signature?

175
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,900
If you sign the consent form for the construction of Boomerang Motel,

176
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,333
we are offering gift certificates and additional event raffle tickets.

177
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,900
Just one signature, please.

178
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,900
- Yes, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

179
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,167
Are you okay?

180
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,567
Of course, it's nothing.

181
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,067
Let's go.

182
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,433
Did you guys sign?

183
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,233
Yes.

184
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,733
It was impossible not to.

185
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,000
They kept chasing us until we did.

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Did they call people in Seoul who specialize only in that kind of thing?

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,133
Is there such a profession?

188
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,500
I don't know. However, there is one thing for sure,

189
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,600
now it feels real that Kang Hee is really dating a wealthy man.

190
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Hey, but should money be spent that way?

191
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Seeing that, I started to feel a bit sorry to Min Jung, too.

192
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,633
Hey, you did your best in your own way. What's there to be sorry about?

193
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,633
I'd feel a bit burdened if a guy did that.

194
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,500
All that matters is confirming each other's feelings.

195
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,133
I don't like flashy things.

196
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:06,900
Dislike? What's there to dislike? You'd like it all if you received it.

197
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,833
- You will like it. 
 - No, I won't.

198
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,533
I like things like handwritten letters.

199
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,667
Excuse me, boss, do you happen to have this necklace?

200
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,733
Ah, this one's a luxury item, so it's not available here.

201
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,700
Then please show me something similar to it.

202
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,200
Even a copy of this, a knockoff, is expensive.

203
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,367
How expensive is it?

204
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,100
It's incredibly expensive.

205
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,933
If you're going to buy something like this, young man, buy a house.

206
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,933
Start with your own home.

207
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,900
No, you keep going on visit calls from dawn till dusk,

208
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,500
and now you even go to places like Duri-eup,which you used to say it was too far.

209
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,933
Why are you overexerting yourself these days, director?

210
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,667
I need to earn money.

211
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,433
Director, were you perhaps shocked? Because of Kang Hee's proposal?

212
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:09,000
It's not like she made that decision for money, is it?

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,900
Of course not, it must be because of the construction. I'll come back.

214
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,267
What?

215
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,767
Sir, please be especially careful of fire on the site.

216
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,600
You must absolutely prevent smoking.

217
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,167
Do that on my site and you're dead.

218
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,600
I know, but please warn them one more time.

219
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,433
All right.

220
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,133
 Manager, to the rooftop. 

221
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,200
Yes, on my way.

222
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,933
Hey, aren't all those cars roaming the streets illegal?

223
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,333
Illegal? What are you talking about?

224
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,533
Don't file a complaint.

225
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,500
I mean, is it okay to waste money like this?

226
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,033
Why not? That's the real life of the rich.

227
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,467
I'm jealous of Kang Hee.

228
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,633
Hey, don't be jealous. If you're envious, you lose.

229
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:00,433
No, if you're jealous, you should copy them, Heon Yeol.

230
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,400
Honestly, you're jealous of that kind of splurging, aren't you?

231
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,033
Try copying that, at least.

232
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,233
Right, you're buying today.

233
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,367
- Yes, you're buying. 
 - Why should I?

234
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,233
You're always bragging about having a lot of money.

235
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,367
- Whenever we meet, we always split the bill. 
 - Honestly, you spend the least.

236
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,467
- You should at least pay today. 
 - Okay, okay. I'll pay today.

237
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:17,000
- Order, whatever. 
 - Boss, could we have the menu, please?

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,567
Please bring it quickly.

239
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:22,133
He's finally buying! Finally paying.

240
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:25,733
Welcome. You can sit over here.

241
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,900
Cool.

242
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,867
Shall we join their table?

243
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,667
Are you freeloading? You said you were buying today.

244
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,500
All right.

245
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,567
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

246
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,467
What's with those two?

247
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,067
This is an interesting combination, isn't it?

248
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,600
Thrilling.

249
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,500
You said you would be friends for life.

250
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,960
Why the sudden change of heart?

251
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,000
Friends…

252
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:37,400
I tried, but I just couldn't do it.

253
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,567
I have to be a guardian when Kang Hee is sick,

254
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,867
and I need to give Kang Hee a hug when she is having a hard time.

255
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,833
Fall asleep together and wake up together.

256
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,000
 From now on, I really need to live well. 

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,333
 So that you liking me wouldn't be embarrassing. 

258
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,867
 Hope you had a happy day today. 

259
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,967
 Good night, Kang Hee. 

260
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:25,300
Eventually, I want to have a beautiful daughter who looks just like Kang Hee.

261
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,133
I can't do it, be her friend.

262
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,967
Is it possible, you two?

263
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:49,833
I've unintentionally heard too much about you two.

264
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,967
I'm not talking about your deceased parents.

265
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,500
Just…

266
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:01,967
I'm worried about the practical barriers that you two will face.

267
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,500
I'm not saying I'll interfere, so relax.

268
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,033
But if by any chance you hurt Kang Hee,

269
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,100
I won't just stand by.

270
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,567
Whoa! You startled me.

271
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,100
You were surprised, right?

272
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,700
- Is it funny? 
 - Yes.

273
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,867
Where have you been until now?

274
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,200
I went to meet someone for a moment.

275
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,867
- Who? 
 - Geum Seok Kyeong.

276
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:54,700
Why? What did he say?

277
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,233
He just asked me to be good to you.

278
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,500
- I told Ah Reum. 
 - Yes.

279
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,767
By now, the others probably know, right?

280
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,167
Really?

281
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,867
What is it?

282
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,867
They say it's a secret for the time being.

283
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,567
Well, I have no one to tell anyway.

284
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:22,500
Then, what about Ms. Yoon?

285
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,100
Did Yeon Soo dump Ms. Yoon?

286
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,233
I'm sure Nam Woo expected that much.

287
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:32,800
Yeon Soo told her about Kang Hee from the start.

288
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,433
Wow! But isn't this really wrong?

289
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:42,133
Then what about that man in the room?

290
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,667
She said she rejected the proposal.

291
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,267
Hello, if she had rejected it, the rumor would be all over the neighborhood.

292
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,467
Then what becomes of that man?

293
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:50,367
Still, that's Kang Hee's decision.

294
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,367
No, why am I taking the side of the person who spent money?

295
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,500
What? Am I the weird one?

296
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,400
No, Yeon Soo will marry Ms. Yoon,

297
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
and Kang Hee will marry the hotel heir, then it's all settled.

298
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Ah, why are you like this? Why do you all twist your own fate!

299
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,633
Then, you should have married Jung Min, too.

300
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,933
Why does Min Jung come up here?

301
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,900
And it's not Jung Min, it's Min Jung. How many years have I been saying that, you fool?

302
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,167
And if you were going to do that, you should have kept working at the company in Seoul.

303
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,467
I must have done wrong.

304
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,367
Ah, I was wrong.

305
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:26,500
No, if people find out again, it'll be mayhem.

306
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,067
At least, let's take their side.

307
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,467
This is not it…

308
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:37,267
It's been years since you met. Do you still call her Ms. Min Jung?

309
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:41,233
Hey, where are you going?

310
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,667
I'm going to Kang Hee.

311
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,133
Are you clueless?

312
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,967
No, if they were together, it would be in this room or that one.

313
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:49,867
What will you do if they are together?

314
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,967
Is that so?

315
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,333
I guess I shouldn't go, then.

316
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,333
Gods! You're talking nonsense.

317
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,033
Let's get some sleep.

318
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,233
Kang Hee isn't here, you know?

319
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,233
He said she isn't there.

320
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,000
- I'm going. 
 - But he said it's not.

321
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,367
It looks like I'm rotten, I am.

322
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:11,100
You did well by telling us.

323
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:15,667
Thank you for telling me first.

324
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,267
We're besties afterall.

325
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,233
Then I will also speak up.

326
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:27,667
Because I have to be honest, too.

327
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,867
I like Seung Eon.

328
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,200
Aren't you surprised?

329
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,067
In the past, I asked Seung Eon

330
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:47,200
about his ideal type.

331
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,633
Yes.

332
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,700
He said his ideal type is a girl who likes books.

333
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,233
And you? Why do you like Seung Eon?

334
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,830
Me?

335
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:09,567
He's small and precious.

336
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,367
Seung Eon?

337
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,467
Hold on, let me laugh for a bit.

338
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,467
Why?

339
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:22,000
No, because I liked him since he was tiny.

340
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,300
Hey, if you say that,

341
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,833
it was not for me but for Seung Eon.

342
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,967
This sly girl!

343
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:34,567
- Look at this cunning lady. 
 - You know my family's situation.

344
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,233
No.

345
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:40,133
I have to marry the person my father has chosen for me.

346
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:43,480
But the only excuse to avoid that was to study.

347
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,833
Now, my doctorate is almost finished.

348
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,200
But did you know

349
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,280
Seung Eon went to find you with a bouquet of flowers?

350
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:02,267
- Really? 
 - A really big one.

351
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,420
Someone said they saw him at the library.

352
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,600
So it was true.

353
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:14,300
I'll really push you forward, just trust me.

354
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,200
In return, you help me out, too.

355
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,630
What?

356
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:29,467
I really wanted to have such a normal date like this.

357
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,867
- Really? 
 - Yeah, really.

358
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,567
Then shall we do it every day from now on?

359
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,170
I like it.

360
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,767
What else should we do?

361
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,833
We walk every day, too.

362
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,600
Hey, do you like it? Do you?

363
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,800
- It's good! 
 - It's good!

364
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,867
- To your position! 
 - To your position!

365
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,367
What do you want to do?

366
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,033
Before Kang Hee goes to Seoul, we should make a lot of memories.

367
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,133
- We need to make them. 
 - We need to make them.

368
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:07,367
If Kang Hee tells you to die, you would?

369
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,100
- I should die then. 
 - I should die then.

370
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,000
Why? Why the quarrel?

371
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,067
Shall we have a match? Like old times?

372
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,467
To your position.

373
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,967
It looks too strong.

374
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,500
Yong Soo, where are you going?

375
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
My clothes are brand new.

376
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:37,133
Let's have another round next time, including Min Goo.

377
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:43,233
Yeon Soo, shall we go take pictures?

378
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,433
Good idea.

379
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:49,500
I can't believe I carried bags for such cowards for a year.

380
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,667
Ah, I'm really ashamed.

381
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,233
Are you embarrassed?

382
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,600
Why is she hanging out with them after leaving that rich guy aside?

383
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,100
That's what I'm saying.

384
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,267
Mind your own business.

385
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,867
If she gets dumped by that guy, it's her loss. Whatever.

386
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,333
Hey, you guys go ahead.

387
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,367
Where are you going?

388
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,067
Why?

389
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,633
Leave it. Let's go.

390
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,600
There's something I want to try.

391
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,733
Me too.

392
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,200
I want to go first.

393
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
I think I know what it is.

394
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,833
What is it?

395
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,167
It's not that.

396
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,567
What is it?

397
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:28,133
Can we decide on our titles?

398
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,520
Yes.

399
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,033
Oh, I like it.

400
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,967
How do you feel today?

401
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,133
A mess.

402
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm too embarrassed to go to Hana-eup.

403
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,867
Should I just go back to America?

404
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,600
Or should I take charge of the group's planning as my father wished?

405
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,267
No.

406
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:08,800
You shouldn't do anything when your emotions are fluctuating like this.

407
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,900
Such important decisions should be made with a calm mind.

408
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,133
You're the only one, my friend. Thank you.

409
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,967
Kang Hee is the one who rejected the offer.

410
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:25,033
Seok Kyeong, do you know how great and cool you are?

411
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,633
That's enough, okay?

412
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:29,033
Do you have the right to say that after rejecting me?

413
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,333
Hey, speak properly.

414
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,700
It's not that I didn't want to marry you, I said I didn't want an arranged marriage.

415
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,200
That's the same.

416
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,067
The words "I don't want an arranged marriage"...

417
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,967
meant that I wanted to hear your confession.

418
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,700
Releasing balloons, scattering flowers,

419
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,933
getting down on one knee and offering me a ring.

420
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:54,433
A lavish and childish proposal like the one you gave to Ms. Kang Hee.

421
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:57,700
That's what I wanted.

422
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,067
Hey!

423
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,333
Don't lie.

424
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,933
That's a lie.

425
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,500
Little Heart,

426
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,933
Mom's first love is heartbroken and in despair, you know?

427
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:16,167
You need to cheer him up.

428
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,567
Get up, let's go.

429
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:22,300
You feel better when you spend money, don't you?

430
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:30,733
Isn't this pretty?

431
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,133
- Is this for a 24 month old? 
 - Yes.

432
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:36,500
Hey, this is so cute.

433
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,533
Little Heart, this really…

434
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,567
That's really funny.

435
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,333
One of everything from here to here, please.

436
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,400
Tell your driver to come, don't carry it yourself.

437
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,833
- Where are you going? 
 - Just a moment.

438
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,433
It's a heart, a heart, isn't it cute?

439
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,200
You're so cute.

440
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,433
You got something here.

441
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,633
Victor, are you okay?

442
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:04,967
Do you know this guy is married?

443
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,933
Are you crazy? Do you know this person?

444
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,433
Victor.

445
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,600
Say hello.

446
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,367
Emily, I'm really sorry.

447
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,267
My friend misunderstood the situation.

448
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,300
Seok Kyeong, this is Victor's cousin.

449
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,633
I invited her to my house since she's come to Korea.

450
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,267
Esther, how about this?

451
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,067
It's really pretty, isn't it?

452
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:42,200
You should stop hanging around with Esther.

453
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,733
How long do I have to put up with this?

454
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,067
I also came to buy a gift for Little Heart.

455
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:51,300
Why are you buying clothes for our baby?

456
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,500
It's upsetting. Please don't do it, okay?

457
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,200
There's still a lot of hay.

458
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,133
Oh, dear! It's better to prepare in advance since it's getting colder.

459
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,067
I'll help out, too.

460
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,667
No, it's heavy.

461
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,280
It's no big deal.

462
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:15,967
Ah, it's a bit heavy.

463
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,567
See, I told you it's heavy.

464
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,600
Thank you, Senior.

465
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,500
Chil Ddaeng is doing well, right?

466
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,767
Ah, of course. Thanks to you, she's very well.

467
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:32,067
If you're curious, come check the blog sometimes.

468
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,133
I'm already following it.

469
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,667
- Oh, you are? 
 - Of course.

470
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,567
Of course, I'm interested. Chil Ddaeng was my first patient.

471
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,700
At first, I thought Chil Ddaeng was the name.

472
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,600
But it turned out to be an ear tag.

473
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,900
Right, number 77, Chil Ddaeng.

474
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,733
Number 38 is Sampal Gwangttaeng.

475
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:48,100
Ah, that one is quite a troublemaker.

476
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,067
Ah, Sa Cheonsa is really funny.

477
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:53,400
Oh, really? I should post more often then.

478
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,867
Ah, Ms. Yoon…

479
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,867
I've heard about it from Yeon Soo.

480
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:00,900
It must be very hard for you, isn't it?

481
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,067
The truth is, breakups, they say, are forgotten by meeting someone else,

482
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:06,333
but it hurts.

483
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,400
No, you said you heard it from the director.

484
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,267
Yes.

485
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:20,333
Actually, we were not even dating.

486
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,767
Is Yeon Soo inside?

487
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:29,000
Why?

488
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,533
What's up with you?

489
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,000
Did you use Ms. Yoon?

490
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,067
Does it feel good making a fool out of someone?

491
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:38,733
You should have at least told me.

492
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,367
Hey, how could I fall for another woman besides Kang Hee?

493
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,533
Ah, that darn Ji Kang Hee!

494
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:47,100
Hey, what about me? Aren't we best friends?

495
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,333
I've supported the two of you so much.

496
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,367
You have no idea how disappointed I am, do you?

497
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,633
But then again, what does that matter to you?

498
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:58,100
Every day it's just "Ji Kang Hee, Ji Kang Hee."

499
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,133
Cut it out!

500
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:02,967
From today on, it's over between you and me.

501
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:06,167
Hey, I'll apologize properly. Just stand there.

502
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,367
What a load of crap! I'm going home.

503
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,733
Because I can't stand the sight of you.

504
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:13,000
You're banned from entering our family farm for life.

505
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,733
Hey, Han Woo! Hey!

506
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,700
Hey, let's talk for a minute.

507
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,400
That's not like you.

508
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,233
Your mom has stopped eating and drinking for days now.

509
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,400
She hasn't said a word like someone with aphasia,

510
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,800
and now I can't even reach her.

511
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,533
She is not answering your calls?

512
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:30,067
It's like nobody knows whether she is alive or dead.

513
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:33,167
Yeon Soo, I didn't expect this from you.

514
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,567
I'll give it a try.

515
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:43,633
 The phone is disconnected, please leave… 

516
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,067
You shouldn't be sleeping.

517
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,100
Yes.

518
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,200
You see, I have a son.

519
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,867
He's been a good kid from his childhood, and never caused any trouble.

520
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:30,767
He met the wrong woman, and now he's planning to leave me.

521
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:34,667
What should I do?

522
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:39,467
You know, things with children don't always go as planned.

523
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:42,867
As the saying goes,

524
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:47,567
"A game of Go-Stop and children don't always turn out as you want".

525
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,000
Do respectable people like you also play Go-Stop?

526
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,933
I'm someone whose heart wavers at the sight of flowers.

527
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:01,700
Go-Stop, what's that? It's Hwatu.

528
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,300
What is Hwatu?

529
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,467
Isn't it a battle of flowers?

530
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:10,467
It's also my field of expertise.

531
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,567
He's a gambler.

532
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,833
Why do you talk like that?

533
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,933
I'll be back.

534
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,567
Kang Hee.

535
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,700
What is it?

536
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:43,733
Why are you here?

537
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,767
I came to take care of you, sit down quickly.

538
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:51,167
You like yogurt, don't you?

539
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,800
Since it's morning, I've prepared something light, with no fat.

540
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,967
I have heard that people on a diet eat a lot of this nowadays.

541
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,900
I'm touched.

542
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,267
Slow down.

543
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,267
It looks delicious.

544
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,300
I will eat well.

545
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,800
Is it good?

546
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,233
Yes, it's delicious.

547
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:30,400
The person who used to put yogurt in my desk drawer every morning.

548
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,567
Of course, it was me.

549
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,633
That's why I came to like this yogurt.

550
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,233
Me too.

551
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,100
- Kang Hee? 
 - Yes?

552
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,867
Instead of secretly hiding like this,

553
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:48,533
I want to take care of you every day.

554
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:51,867
How about we just stop thinking and go for it?

555
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:55,000
Risking all the whispers and gossip,

556
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,800
shall we just hold hands and face it head-on?

557
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,067
Okay, let's do that.

558
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:12,510
Are you busy today? 
  (*Similar to "share a room for tonight") 

559
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,467
I misunderstood.

560
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,900
Are you busy today?

561
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,933
Not busy at all.

562
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,133
There are really a lot of pretty things.

563
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:31,467
You can choose something expensive. I'll pay with my savings.

564
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:33,033
I don't like it.

565
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:37,000
I am going to buy the prettiest one here.

566
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,133
Please show me this.

567
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,000
How much is this?

568
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,933
It's the cheapest here.

569
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,333
You are thrifty, Miss.

570
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:53,333
It's not bad, but wouldn't it be prettier with something embedded like this?

571
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,733
I think this is the prettiest?

572
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,033
Try it on.

573
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,520
♫  I want a better past  ♫

574
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,580
♫  I look at you every, every day  ♫

575
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,533
- What is this? 
 - Together.

576
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,667
I will buy you something better later.

577
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,833
Your thought is enough.

578
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,400
Wow! I didn't expect Ji Kang Hee to be so cliché.

579
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,800
It's classic.

580
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,900
Anyway, this conversation ends here.

581
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,233
One more time and I'll kiss you.

582
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,333
Right now?

583
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,900
Oh my, look over there.

584
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:44,100
- Kang Hee? 
 - Oh my, goodness.

585
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
No way.

586
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,900
- No way. 
 - Why?

587
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,267
Eat some bread.

588
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:52,867
Let's eat together.

589
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,767
A man's whim all passes.

590
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:02,033
Just a blink and then you open your eyes.

591
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:05,500
Out of sight, out of mind.

592
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,100
Kang Hee will leave soon, so just bear with it a little.

593
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,367
Ah, Su Ji likes you so much.

594
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:17,467
For the sake of our Su Ji, please look after Yeon Soo just once?

595
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,933
There has been a misunderstanding.

596
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:23,120
I have never dated the director.

597
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,030
It was just a rumor.

598
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:28,767
Ms. Yoon, this is holding grudges.

599
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,360
Your pride must have been hurt.

600
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,060
I understand.

601
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:35,367
Start from the beginning again?

602
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:40,100
Ms. Yoon, it's a big deal.

603
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,400
Chil Ddaeng suddenly collapsed.

604
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,633
I would like you to come with me.

605
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:50,233
Senior, Chil Ddaeng seems fine.

606
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:53,733
The fur is in good condition, and so is the nutrition.

607
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,833
And the mood…

608
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:00,300
Seems good, doesn't it?

609
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:03,067
Ah, but…

610
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:05,067
Do cows normally do that?

611
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:09,967
I mean, shouldn't the cow's tail be a bit more lively?

612
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:12,700
I mean, the tails of healthy cows

613
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,867
should be somewhat more… The tail seems a bit too tame.

614
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,233
What is that?

615
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,600
That's why it is like that.

616
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,133
Why do you come home and upset your mother's peace?

617
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:26,500
Father.

618
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,300
Don't just look for animal welfare,

619
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,100
try to address elderly welfare first.

620
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,967
Father, Ms. Yoon is also here.

621
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:36,567
Oh, my! Can't you have some consideration and live properly?

622
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,800
Gosh, I've never seen such happy cows before, sir.

623
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,533
It seems that Han Woo has a kind and upright character just like his father.

624
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:48,600
Well, he is refined.

625
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,050
His father supports his dream,

626
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,167
that's why he lives so wonderfully.

627
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,067
You are amazing, sir. Awesome!

628
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,300
Please go, Dad.

629
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,167
Thank you.

630
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,600
You saved me at the hospital earlier, right?

631
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,700
No, wasn't it you who saved me from my father earlier?

632
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,567
- Thank you. 
 - No, I'm grateful.

633
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:26,200
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

634
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,233
- I'm sorry. 
 - I apologize.

635
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,033
Would you like to talk in my room before you go?

636
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,800
No.

637
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,367
Are you tired? Go inside and sleep quickly.

638
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,833
- Let's go to my room to talk. 
 - Hm?

639
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:55,000
In your room the security is lax, isn't it?

640
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,733
Is that so? Let's go.

641
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,700
Why the light?

642
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,567
What are you doing?

643
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:23,167
Fine, do it with the light on.

644
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,133
Huh? What's this? It's not working.

645
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,933
- Stay still. 
 - Don't do it, this is home.

646
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:29,200
Do it at home or outside?

647
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,233
Are you that type?

648
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:34,200
Cheon Yeon Soo, it's bold, isn't that so?

649
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,533
Don't tease me. What if someone comes like last time?

650
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:38,300
Who's coming?

651
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,367
Okay. If you say not to do it, I won't do it.

652
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,000
I'll wait for you.

653
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,633
Since we won't do it,

654
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,767
come here.

655
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,033
 Kang Hee! Kang Hee, come out. 

656
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,000
Let's go.

657
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,733
Let's go.

658
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:34,533
What's going on at this time of night?

659
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:38,500
She has no socks. It's cold outside.

660
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,700
Please rest.

661
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,400
Come out after a moment, I'll give you what you need.

662
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,133
Thank you.

663
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,600
Give me a glass, too.

664
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:31,300
Thank you.

665
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:34,767
Sorry for worrying you.

666
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:44,867
I can't take it anymore because of my mom, really.

667
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,933
I'm going crazy because of my mom too, really.

668
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:53,300
She's been protesting by not contacting me for days.

669
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,933
A few days? That's cute.

670
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:59,733
My mom left me here and went away.

671
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:02,633
What is this, a battle?

672
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:09,367
My mom ran away, abandoned me, and then died.

673
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,733
This is mine, right?

674
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:17,867
It's not over yet.

675
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,533
The kind and noble principal you all know...

676
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,967
is a domestic abuser.

677
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,733
I heard my mom was beaten before I was born.

678
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:38,267
But she's holding out because she says she won't divorce.

679
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:42,267
She said she wouldn't divorce until I'm married.

680
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,167
Thank you.

681
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,033
I'm going to see my mom now.

682
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,000
Go inside.

683
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,600
Okay.

684
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,100
When is Mr. Chun Pil coming back?

685
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,767
Go upstairs.

686
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:04,333
 Oh, daughter. 

687
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,500
Mr. Chun Pil, where are you?

688
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,733
When are you coming back?

689
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:11,367
 Were you here? I found you. 

690
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,133
Ms. Hwang?

691
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,267
- Ms. Hwang? 
  - Go inside. 

692
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,533
Are you okay on your own?

693
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:31,467
But why do you keep treating me like I'm sick?

694
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:34,867
I'm fine, I came to get tested.

695
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:38,400
Since you're uncomfortable, I'll go back.

696
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,300
- I'll come tomorrow. 
 - You don't have to come.

697
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,600
I will come.

698
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,433
- Pardon? 
 - Never mind.

699
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:47,233
Please, go back.

700
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,333
- Then… 
 - Yes.

701
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:06,300
 Dad, don't be sick. 

702
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,500
Oh dear, did you call to make Dad cry?

703
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,367
Hang up quickly. The phone bill will be huge.

704
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:14,833
My daughter, I love you.

705
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,867
 - Got it.  
 - Dad will get better soon.

706
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,467
 Talk soon. 

707
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:21,467
Take care.

708
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,467
I'm sorry, you should be sleeping.

709
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:29,667
My daughter is overseas, thus the time difference.

710
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,200
It's okay, don't worry about it.

711
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,667
I also just spoke with my daughter.

712
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,733
Was that your wife earlier?

713
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,067
No, she's a friend.

714
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,567
My wife has gone on a trip far away.

715
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:58,333
 Honey. 

716
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,700
 Mia. 

717
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,600
 Mia! Mia! 

718
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,100
 Welcome to Motel California. 

719
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,533
 Such a lovely place. 

720
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:09,167
 ♪ Such a lovely place ♪ 

721
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,767
 Let's go to California. 

722
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:14,933
 Mia, that's the place you wanted to go to so much, California. 

723
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,300
 This time, our whole family is going together. 

724
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,167
 We'll go and show it to Kang Hee as well. 

725
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,900
 This time we're spending Christmas in California. 

726
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,267
 How about it? Nice, right? 

727
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,800
 This time, I… 

728
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,900
 This time, when I go to Seoul, 

729
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,200
 I'll definitely buy a plane ticket and come back. 

730
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,033
 You can trust me this time. 

731
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:36,833
 This time it's for real. 

732
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,300
 I promise you. Okay? 

733
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:03,733
Thanks to you, I arrived.

734
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:08,467
Is this a donkey managed by the clinic?

735
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:13,667
It looks just like Julie, whom I raised in San Francisco.

736
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:16,033
Did you raise a donkey?

737
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,600
Yes.

738
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:21,600
It's a bit small for a miniature breed.

739
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,433
It's a child abandoned by its owner, so we're looking for a place to send it.

740
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:28,433
Oh dear, that's unfortunate.

741
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,867
May I take it with me?

742
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:33,333
Oh, right…

743
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,933
I should introduce myself.

744
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,167
I happened to be passing by to drive your mother,

745
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,200
and I just met eyes with this donkey.

746
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,067
Our eyes locked so deeply.

747
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,667
Come by with your mother,

748
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:50,567
and check if the conditions are fit for raising a donkey.

749
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,767
Well then, that's all.

750
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,600
Take care.

751
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,360
   

752
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,767
Who is that person?

753
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:14,800
Who are you? Do you know me?

754
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:19,433
Mom.

755
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:24,833
Mom, please at least unblock me.

756
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:38,331
That worked out well.

757
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:40,600
I was just about to say hello and leave.

758
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Where are you going?

759
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,767
Seoul.

760
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:46,233
I need to confirm the order, but I can't reach Director Geum.

761
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,033
I'm thinking of going there myself.

762
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:50,400
Do you really have to go?

763
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:54,133
Wait.

764
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:57,767
Hand.

765
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,033
Come back quickly.

766
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:10,600
I don't know what it is, but cheer up.

767
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,866
And wait for me.

768
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:16,666
Okay, I'll take good care of the house.

769
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:34,466
Director.

770
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,266
Your phone was turned off.

771
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:46,000
I've confirmed the order. When will you come to the site?

772
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,066
I'll see.

773
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:53,866
This.

774
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,133
I'll go back and take a look.

775
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:20,000
It's my first time seeing the director like that.

776
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,155
It's the same for me.

777
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:28,270
Maybe, it's probably the shock,

778
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,900
as it is the first time he has lost in a competition.

779
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,400
He'll overcome it.

780
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,900
Because he is a bright and pleasant person.

781
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,866
The truth is, he is not really the competitive type.

782
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:44,933
"Can't do it? Okay, I won't then."

783
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:47,666
He has always been like this.

784
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,466
It's also the first time I've seen it.

785
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:53,733
It seems he liked you a lot.

786
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:59,266
I'm not too worried because he has you.

787
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:03,266
This time, even I am of no use.

788
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,633
I gave the driver a vacation on purpose, you know?

789
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:09,433
Seok Kyeong was trying to get a ride using that as an excuse.

790
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,466
He says he dislikes driving.

791
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:16,900
Let's go, I will give you a ride.

792
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:27,866
We've arrived.

793
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:30,233
Thank you.

794
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:33,600
Oh? It's Victor.

795
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,100
He's with Emily.

796
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,566
Who is it?

797
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:39,200
Victor's cousin.

798
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,133
No…

799
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:09,333
Get out. Hurry and get out, Esther.

800
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,933
I'll go at full speed.

801
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,133
What's wrong?

802
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,366
We'll go to the hospital first.

803
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:40,566
- It's so delicious. 
 - Chun Pil.

804
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:42,433
Oh, you're here?

805
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,200
Eat.

806
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,966
Tell him about Kang Hee.

807
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:47,333
I'm telling you to talk about it now.

808
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,166
Hurry up and go! Hurry!

809
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,100
Go, quickly.

810
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:55,366
It's about Kang Hee.

811
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,100
Speak, it's okay.

812
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,733
You didn't know Kang Hee was proposed to by a man living in Seoul, did you?

813
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:05,866
The neighborhood was in quite an uproar.

814
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:08,266
To have received such a grand proposal, and

815
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,933
in the meantime, while that man went to Seoul, she and Yeon Soo…

816
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,366
I see.

817
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:15,266
Why do you talk about it with such excitement?

818
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:17,400
I understood.

819
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,933
No.

820
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:21,233
Su Ji will hear about it soon, too.

821
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:23,866
I thought you should know.

822
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:26,433
Okay, I got it.

823
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,833
Shall I call Ms. Kang Hee up to Seoul?

824
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,000
There's a lot of work for her at the headquarters.

825
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,400
No.

826
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,270
Even so, the last memories at Hana-eup shouldn't be like that.

827
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:49,433
Yes.

828
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:54,600
- You said it's Kang Hee's first time as a field manager, right? 
 - Yes.

829
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,033
But that girl...

830
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:01,800
is struggling alone in Seoul.

831
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,200
She built her career with difficulty.

832
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,333
Don't we have something like an opening ceremony?

833
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:13,966
Of course, we're planning to do it splendidly with a rooftop pool party.

834
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:19,400
Actually, it would be really nice if Kang Hee was the main character that day.

835
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,133
Kang Hee could remember Hana-eup with that memory.

836
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:26,066
And the people of Hana-eup as well,

837
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:30,800
will remember Kang Hee as a successful designer.

838
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,200
Yes, Mr. Chun Pil.

839
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,033
I was short-sighted.

840
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:37,133
No, not at all.

841
00:56:37,733 --> 00:56:39,790
Chun Pil!

842
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:44,300
Chun Pil!

843
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:48,000
Then, I will go to the construction site.

844
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,666
Yes, take care.

845
00:56:57,366 --> 00:56:59,700
Stay still.

846
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:03,733
You heard that, too?

847
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:06,900
What I was worried about has finally happened.

848
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,433
What are you going to do now?

849
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:10,666
What is there to do about it?

850
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,133
Just have to cut it off!

851
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:17,366
I heard that the hotel heir has proposed to Kang Hee.

852
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:19,890
She should live comfortably in Seoul with that man.

853
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,700
Why is she seeing Yeon Soo?

854
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,600
No, even to the point of being pointed at by the people in this town.

855
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,600
What honor is there to gain?

856
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,000
It's about Kang Hee,

857
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
who is a top-notch interior designer.

858
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,440
What synergy could possibly come out

859
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,800
of seeing a countryside veterinarian?

860
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,066
What!

861
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:42,533
Are you saying that Yeon Soo is lacking right now, Chun Pil?

862
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,866
No, that's not what I mean.

863
00:57:44,866 --> 00:57:48,100
I have experience, right?

864
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,366
Forced into a marriage that was opposed, you know.

865
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,266
After Kang Hee's mother had a tough married life.

866
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:56,600
Hey, just thinking about that makes me really…

867
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,470
Rather than have you mistreat her,

868
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:02,333
I'd rather send Kang Hee up to Seoul.

869
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:05,000
Hey, be honest.

870
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,966
You wouldn't treat Kang hee well, would you?

871
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:09,566
Are you confident that you won't mistreat her?

872
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:12,466
There shouldn't have been such a situation in the first place!

873
00:58:12,466 --> 00:58:13,633
That's why!

874
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:17,266
I'll settle things well, so it doesn't happen.

875
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:19,400
Don't get involved.

876
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,666
I trust you.

877
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:23,700
Ah, don't worry, Soon Ja.

878
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,666
Su Ji.

879
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,233
I think you just need to check this part.

880
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:29,233
Yes, I will take action right away.

881
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:31,633
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

882
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,066
You all have worked hard.

883
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:35,133
Yes, thank you.

884
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:38,766
When did you arrive?

885
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:42,966
She has been here since earlier, looking around everywhere.

886
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:44,200
Oh, you came?

887
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,633
Ms. Hwang!

888
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,333
You came without notice?

889
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,233
What's the big deal, between us?

890
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:53,666
It feels like a mother-in-law is coming in to inspect the house while it's empty.

891
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:55,500
The mother-in-law went too far.

892
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,433
- How about Mom? 
 - Sorry?

893
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:01,433
Kang Hee. I'm your mom…

894
00:59:01,433 --> 00:59:04,566
Ew! Ms. Hwang, that's gross!

895
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,800
Aren't you cold?

896
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,733
Wear something like a muffler.

897
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:11,366
What about the one I gifted you?

898
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:14,300
It seems to turn out even better than expected.

899
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,466
Suffer a little bit more.

900
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:17,866
Next time you come, please wear a padded jacket,

901
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:19,933
- It's cold. 
 - Yes.

902
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:21,666
I'll treat you to a company dinner before I go.

903
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:22,966
Find a place.

904
00:59:22,966 --> 00:59:24,400
Just give me the card.

905
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,466
It's burdensome if you come along.

906
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:28,100
Is that so?

907
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,200
Then, we'd have to listen to the manager.

908
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Got it.

909
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:59,233
That's right, it belongs to President Hwang.

910
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:04,000
Did you go on a trip with the president?

911
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,900
Well, we are both adults, after all.

912
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,066
Who's saying what?

913
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:10,900
Can't I even ask?

914
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,966
Then, can I ask something too?

915
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:20,700
If I don't see President Hwang, can you also not see Yeon Soo?

916
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,800
Mr. Chun Pil.

917
01:00:27,466 --> 01:00:30,933
The question is a bit raw.

918
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,833
Knock, knock.

919
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,366
Mister.

920
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,500
Welcome. Have you been well?

921
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,366
No. Kang Hee and I missed you a lot.

922
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,300
Really?

923
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,700
I heard the rumors.

924
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:06,800
You'll support us, right?

925
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,033
We don't know about others, but you're on our side.

926
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:15,100
Mister.

927
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,400
Living, I've realized life is really short.

928
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeon Soo, don't live a hard life.

929
01:01:24,066 --> 01:01:26,566
Are you saying this because you're worried Kang Hee might struggle?

930
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:29,300
Don't worry, I might go to Seoul.

931
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,400
I also know how much you like Hana-eup.

932
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,266
I also know very well how much Kang Hee dislikes Hana-eup.

933
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:41,733
I don't like it when you guys have a hard time.

934
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:43,700
Mister.

935
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,310
He hasn't been a dad since I was ten,

936
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:52,900
what has he been doing all this time?

937
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,566
Is he pretending to be a dad now?

938
01:01:55,566 --> 01:01:58,166
I'm just dumbfounded.

939
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,633
What should we do?

940
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,500
What do you mean, "What should we do"?

941
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,333
I didn't know your father would object.

942
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,833
Just ignore it.

943
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:07,330
So what?

944
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:10,100
It's not like you're dating me because your mom approves of it.

945
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,100
That's true.

946
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,433
You'll take responsibility for me, right?

947
01:02:18,766 --> 01:02:20,966
I don't want to go home.

948
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,800
Then, shall we go to Seoul?

949
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:36,033
Just for the sake of it, let's go for a drive and get some fresh air.

950
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,400
And finish what we haven't done.

951
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,900
Okay.

952
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,066
You be prepared.

953
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:43,433
You be prepared!

954
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:49,600
Then let me just check on the animalsone last time before we go.

955
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,666
If you need to pack anything, pack it and come out.

956
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:53,166
See you at the parking lot in 30 minutes.

957
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:55,066
Okay.

958
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:57,900
See you later.

959
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,690
   

960
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:20,600
You think you won against me?

961
01:03:21,733 --> 01:03:26,733
Eventually, you'll be punished by heaven, just like your mother.

962
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,800
 Do you remember this? 

963
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,900
 Now, everyone, get ready. 

964
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,100
 Let's go. 

965
01:04:09,366 --> 01:04:14,633
 I wished that this man was my father. 

966
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:17,333
 Because he always made Mom laugh. 

967
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,333
 Actually, me too. 

968
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:25,033
 I also wished that your mom was my mother. 

969
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:29,566
 We've been accomplices since then. 

970
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,500
 Indeed. 

971
01:04:38,233 --> 01:04:41,033
 Is it okay for us to do this, Yeon Soo? 

972
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:50,866
 I'm sure both of them 

973
01:04:50,866 --> 01:04:53,666
 would want us to be happy. 

974
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,933
 Don't worry. 

975
01:05:41,866 --> 01:05:45,533
 - Please come out. 
 - It seems like a severe injury. 

976
01:05:45,966 --> 01:05:48,166
- Stop! 
 - What?

977
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,000
There's been an accident.

978
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,600
Where?

979
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,400
Pull over! Pull over!

980
01:06:19,466 --> 01:06:21,633
Pulse and oxygen saturation seem to be all right.

981
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:22,833
There's no consciousness.

982
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:25,333
Prepare for brain CT and also conduct a blood test, please.

983
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,200
Yes.

984
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,333
 You'll be punished by heaven, just like your mother. 

985
01:06:52,933 --> 01:06:54,933
 Is it okay for us to do this, Yeon Soo? 

986
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:56,340
   

987
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:04,210


988
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,670
   

989
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,700
 I think I saw Mom... 

990
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,390
 Why isn't she waking up? 

991
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,280
 Let me say this as Kang Hee's father. 

992
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,920
 Please protect her. 

993
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,420
 Kang Hee is my entire world. 

994
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,860
 I killed a person. 

995
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,200
 Find it. 

996
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,580
 My doll. 

997
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,600
 Please forgive me. 

998
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,660
 Whenever it's cold or tough, come to me. 

999
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,720
 I'll hug you.
