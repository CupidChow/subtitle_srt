1
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,433
Let's date.

2
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,667
Are you sure?

3
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:48,700
Yes.

4
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,600
From now on, I'll only look
and think only of you.

5
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:57,033
All this time, I've lived hoping that
everyone around me would be happy.

6
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,567
From now on, I'll give up all my desires,

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,833
and only make you happy.

8
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:06,700
I've always had someone by my side.

9
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,100
But you've always been alone.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,233
From now on, I'll never
let go of your hand again.

11
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm back.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,933
Did something good happen?

13
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,400
What could have happened?

14
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,033
<i>♪ Do you know ♪</i>

15
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:19,533
<i>♪ The white thing attached
to the tangerine is called ♪</i>

16
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:23,133
<i>♪ Tangerine pith ♪</i>

17
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,567
What should I do?

18
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,400
We have prepared a premium yacht event.

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,133
It's a hotel event.

20
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,400
We have prepared a drone show.

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,567
How about some fireworks?

22
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,500
As you can see, we were invited
to the World Firework Festival

23
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,700
after recognition of our skills…

24
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,400
It's a countryside village that still
gets complaints about noise,

25
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,200
and the leaders of that village
go to bed early at night.

26
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,333
Considering local characteristics,
we will make another proposal.

27
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,833
Yes, as soon as possible.

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:16,900
I would like to request an event that
can demonstrate a more extensive influence.

29
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,700
<i>[Director, me and Yeon Soo…]</i>

30
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,300
<i>[Director, the necklace…]</i>

31
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,700
Kang Hee!

32
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,933
Thank you.

33
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,200
You wanted to see me so badly,
you came out early, didn't you?

34
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course, I wanted to see you.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,433
I wanted to see you more.

36
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,767
Why? Is something wrong?

37
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,533
I think I've messed everything up again.

38
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,533
What did you mess up?

39
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,100
I should have told you earlier,

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,167
but I ended up accepting the necklace.

41
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,233
What necklace?

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,700
<i>I'll cover up the nonsense that
troubles you with my own rumors.</i>

43
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,000
<i>I'm still your official boyfriend, aren't I?</i>

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,567
<i>But you're not my real boyfriend.</i>

45
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,033
<i>There's no reason for me
to accept something like this.</i>

46
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,267
<i>You seem to be under a misconception.</i>

47
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,367
<i>I'm doing my job right now.</i>

48
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,000
<i>Getting the construction to start again,</i>

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,567
<i>and making sure the person in charge
can work in the best condition,</i>

50
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,333
<i>is my duty after all.</i>

51
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,167
<i>Here. It's for the construction,
so take it, quickly.</i>

52
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,033
<i>If it is really burdensome, you can
return it after the construction is over.</i>

53
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:46,033
<i>Do you think receiving the necklace will
cover up the rumors and solve the issue?</i>

54
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,300
<i>I have it all planned out.</i>

55
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
<i>Let's cooperate for the construction.</i>

56
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,667
<i>If you're the person in charge, act like one.</i>

57
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>If we can just resume the construction,
I could even accept ten of these necklaces.</i>

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>Give it to me.</i>

59
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,233
<i>They say you'll grab
the straws if you're drowning.</i>

60
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:06,300
<i>Does this look like a straw to you?</i>

61
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>Or do I look like a straw to you?</i>

62
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,933
<i>I'll make sure to clear up the rumors
before we resume construction,</i>

63
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,767
<i>so brighten up your face!</i>

64
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,833
Cheon Yeon Soo,

65
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,833
are you laughing?

66
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,967
What was it again?

67
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:35,300
You took it because of work, it means
you have nothing to do with that man.

68
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,900
That's a relief, it's not too late.

69
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,967
It's already too late!

70
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,167
You've been really pretentious
all this time, haven't you?

71
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,767
Even if I spout nonsense about wanting
to be friends or whatever in the future,

72
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,800
catch on quickly that it's all a bluff.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,867
When I say "don't follow me",
if you really don't follow,

74
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:57,800
and when I tell you to go away,
if you just go away,

75
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,267
I'll kill you!

76
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,067
Do you feel wronged?

77
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,267
Are you dumbfounded?

78
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,500
No.

79
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,033
Your lips are so pretty
when you're angry like this.

80
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,433
I can't hear anything but look at them.

81
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,567
Keep talking.

82
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,100
Speak more.

83
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,433
Even if there's a rumor going around
that I'm getting married,

84
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:28,833
don't believe such things.

85
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:33,933
And if I say that things are tough and
talk about "throwing the towel or quitting",

86
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,533
don't be swayed by that.

87
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,367
From today, we're starting day one.

88
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,400
No.

89
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,400
When the director returns,
I'll return the necklace.

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,633
Let's start over from then.

91
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,167
Completely, without any fault.

92
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,233
Do I have to wait again?

93
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,033
Don't worry, he'll be right back.

94
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
Okay.

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Then, until that time,
let's just keep it casual.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,167
What's that?

97
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,200
It's a date proposal.

98
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,033
It's warm.

99
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,967
- Is it warm?
- Yes.

100
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,133
Oh? It's a shooting star!

101
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,133
- Where?
- Over there!

102
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,133
Did you make a wish? Wish!

103
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,000
I was kidding.

104
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,567
Look at the damaged skin texture.

105
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,567
I need to take care of it.

106
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,900
It's become firm.

107
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,833
Good! Good!

108
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,000
Good morning!

109
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,233
Where are you going?

110
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:37,267
A date, perhaps?

111
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,467
What date?

112
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:50,567
What's so noisy?

113
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,867
I didn't say anything.

114
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,000
Me neither.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,033
I didn't say anything either.

116
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,033
No, it's vibrating.

117
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,600
- The phone is ringing, isn't it?
- Really!

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,333
Yes, director.

121
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,100
Right now?

122
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,167
To where?

123
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,633
Try going over there.

124
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,467
It's pretty, isn't it?

125
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,833
This way.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,167
- Miss!
- Miss!

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,267
- You can go this way.
- You can go this way.

128
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,533
You can go this way.

129

Hello!

130
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,967
Which way?

131
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,267
Shall we go this way?

132
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,000
They say the song has started, the song.

133
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,300
No, I want to go.

134
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,233
Ah, I want to go.

135
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,533
Ah, I need to go.

136
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,667
Wait a minute.

137
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,233
Come with me.

138
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,233
Kang Hee, what's all this in Hana-eup?

139
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:35,900
Hey, that's too cool!

140
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,033
Thanks to you, I'm living
it up! I'm really enjoying!

141
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm envious!

142
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:45,667

Don't. Please, don't.

No one missed it, right?

149
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,067
It doesn't happen every day, after all.

150
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't forget and make sure to participate.

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Watch a show, have a party,
and enjoy delicious food.

152
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,333
This is all thanks to our hotel heir.

153

Young and rich, tall and handsome
Geum Seok Kyeong.

154
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,867
This was done right away, right?

155
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,233
It seems like it took months to prepare.

156
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,200
This is an event prepared
personally for Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

157
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,133
Should I say it's the power of money?

158
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,067
The work does get done rather quickly.

159
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:40,800
Indeed, the scale of an heir
is hugely different, right?

160
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,867
Thank you.

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,900
Hello, can I please have your signature?

If you sign the consent form for

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,800
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

166
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,967
Are you okay?

167
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,567
Of course, it's nothing.

168
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,467
Let's go.

00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,433
Did you guys sign?

170
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,233
Yes.

171
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:14,633
Hey, it was impossible not to do it, right?

172
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,900
No, they kept chasing us until we did.

173
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Did they call people in Seoul
who specialize only in that kind of thing?

174
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,033
Is there such a profession?

175
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,200
I don't know. But, one thing's for sure,

176
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,500
now it feels real that Kang Hee
is really dating a wealthy man.

177
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Hey, but should money be spent that way?

178
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,100
Seeing that, I started to feel
a bit sorry to Min Jung too.

179
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,633
Hey, you did your best in your own way.
What's there to be sorry about?

180
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:39,633
I'd feel a bit burdened if a guy did that.

181
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,500
All that matters is confirming
each other's feelings.

182
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,033
I don't like flashy things.

183
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:47,800
Dislike? What's there to dislike?
You'd like it all if you received it.

184
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,733
- You will like it.
- No, I won't.

185
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:55,533
I like things like handwritten letters.

186
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:59,667
Excuse me, boss, do you
happen to have this necklace?

187
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,533
Ah, this one's a luxury item,
so it's not available here.

188
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,600
Then please show me something similar to it.

189
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Even a copy of this, a knockoff, is expensive.

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,267
How expensive is it?

191
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,900
It's incredibly expensive.

192
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,533
If you're going to buy something
like this, young man,

193
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,933
buy a house. Start with your own home.

194
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,800
No, you keep going on visit
calls from dawn till dusk,

195
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,500
and now you even go to places like Duri-eup,
which you used to say it was too far.

196
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,833
Why are you overexerting
yourself these days, director?

197
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,867
I need to earn money.

198
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:45,433
Director, were you perhaps shocked?
Because of Kang Hee's proposal?

199
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,900
It's not like she made
that decision for money, is it?

200
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,800
Of course not, it must be because
of the construction. I'll come back.

201
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,667
What?

202
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,767
Sir, please be especially
careful of fire on the site.

203
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,500
You must absolutely prevent smoking.

204
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,067
Do that on my site and you're dead.

205
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,600
I know, but please warn them one more time.

206
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,333
Alright.

207
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,033
<i>Manager, to the rooftop.</i>

208
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes, on my way.

209
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,733
Hey, aren't all those cars
roaming the streets illegal?

210
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,233
Illegal? What are you talking about?

211
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,333
Don't file a complaint.

212
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,400
I mean, is it okay to waste money like this?

213
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,033
Why not? That's the real life of the rich.

214
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,367
I'm jealous of Kang Hee.

215
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,433
Hey, don't be jealous.
If you're envious, you lose.

216
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:41,333
No, if you're jealous, you
should copy them, Heon Yeol.

217
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,300
Honestly, you're jealous of that
kind of splurging, aren't you?

218
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,933
Try copying that, at least.

219
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,233
Right, you're buying today.

220
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,567
Yes, you're buying.

221
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,533
Why should I?

222
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,133
You're always bragging
about having a lot of money.

223
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:53,267
- Whenever we meet, we always split the bill.
- Honestly, you spend the least.

224
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,367
- You should at least pay today.
- Okay, okay. I'll pay today.

225
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,000
- Order, whatever.
- Boss, could we have the menu, please?

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,567
Please bring it quickly.

227
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,733
He's finally buying! Finally paying.

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,633
Welcome.

229
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,100
You can sit over here.

230
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,900
Cool.

231
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,767
Shall we join their table?

232
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:23,567
Are you freeloading?
You said you were buying today.

233
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,400
Alright.

234
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,767
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

235
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,367
What's with those two?

236
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,967
This is an interesting combination, isn't it?

237
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:46,400
Thrilling.

238
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:06,767
You said you would be friends for life.
Why the sudden change of heart?

239
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,400
Friends…

240
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:18,400
I tried, but I just couldn't do it.

241
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,467
I have to be a guardian when Kang Hee is sick,

242
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,667
and I need to give Kang Hee a hug
when she is having a hard time.

243
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,833
Fall asleep together

244
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,033
and wake up together.

245
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,100
<i>From now on, I really need to live well.</i>

246
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,433
<i>So that you liking me wouldn't be embarrassing.</i>

247
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,767
<i>Hope you had a happy day today.</i>

248
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,267
<i>Good night, Kang Hee.</i>

249
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:06,300
Eventually, I want to have a beautiful
daughter who looks just like Kang Hee.

250
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,333
I can't do it, be her friend.

251
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,067
Is it possible, you two?

252
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:31,033
I've unintentionally heard
too much about you two.

253
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,867
I'm not talking about your deceased parents.

254
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,700
Just…

255
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:43,067
I'm worried about the practical
barriers that you two will face.

256
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm not saying I'll interfere, so relax.

257
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,733
But if by any chance you hurt Kang Hee,

258
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,100
I won't just stand by.

259
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,667
Whoa! You startled me.

260
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,000
You were surprised, right?

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
- Is it funny?
- Yes.

262
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,867
Where have you been until now?

263
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,200
I went to meet someone for a moment.

264
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,467
Who?

265
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,767
Geum Seok Kyeong.

266
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,800
Why?

267
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,533
What did he say?

268
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:39,133
He just asked me to be good to you.

269
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,700
I told Ah Reum.

270
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,667
- Yes.
- By now, the others probably know, right?

271
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,467
Really?

272
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,767
What is it?

273
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,900
- Shh.
- Shh.

274
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,667
They say it's a secret for the time being.

275
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,667
Well, I have no one to tell anyway.

276
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,300
Then, what about Ms. Yoon?

277
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,900
Did Yeon Soo dump Ms. Yoon?

278
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,033
Nan Woo must have been
emotionally prepared too.

279
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeon Soo was talking about
Kang Hee from the start.

280
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,233
Wow! But isn't this really wrong?

281
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,633
Then what about that man in the room?

282
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:24,467
She said she rejected the proposal.

283
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:27,267
Hello, if she had rejected it, the rumor
would be all over the neighborhood.

284
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,367
Then what becomes of that man?

285
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:31,167
Still, that's Kang Hee's decision.

286
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,267
No, why am I taking the side
of the person who spent money?

287
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,400
What, am I the weird one?

288
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,300
No, Yeon Soo will marry Ms. Yoon,

289
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,300
and Kang Hee will marry
the hotel heir, then it's all settled.

290
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Ah, why are you like this?
Why do you all twist your own fate!

291
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,533
Then, you should have married Jung Min too.

292
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,833
Why does Min Jung come up here?

293
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,800
And it's not Jung Min, it's Min Jung. How
many years have I been saying that, you fool?

294
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,867
And if you were going to do that, you should
have kept working at the company in Seoul.

295
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,467
I must have done wrong.

296
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,267
Ah, I was wrong.

297
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:07,500
No, if people find out again, it'll be mayhem.

298
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,067
At least, let's take their side.

299
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,367
This is not it…

300
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,167
It's been years since you met.
Do you still call her Ms. Min Jung?

301
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:22,233
Hey, where are you going?

302
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,567
I'm going to Kang Hee.

303
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,033
Are you clueless?

304
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,967
No, if they were together,
it would be in this room or that one.

305
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,767
What will you do if they are together?

306
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,867
Is that so?

307
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,333
I guess I shouldn't go, then.

308
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,333
Gods! You're talking nonsense.

309
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,933
Let's get some sleep.

310
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,233
Kang Hee isn't here, you know?

311
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,133
He said she isn't there.

312
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,800
- I'm going.
- But he said it's not.

313
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,267
It looks like I'm rotten, I am.

314
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,100
You did well by telling us.

315
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:56,467
Thank you for telling me first.

316
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:59,167
We're best friends, right?

317
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,033
Then I will also speak up.

318
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,467
Because I have to be honest too.

319
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:14,667
I like Seung Eon.

320
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,000
Aren't you surprised?

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,067
In the past, I asked Seung Eon

322
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,000
about his ideal type.

323
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,533
Yes.

324
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:32,500
He said his ideal type
is a girl who likes books.

325
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:42,233
And you? Why do you like Seung Eon?

326
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,200
Me?

327
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,367
He's small and precious.

328
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,267
Seung Eon?

329
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,067
Hold on, let me laugh for a bit.

330
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,267
Why?

331
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:02,800
No, because I liked him since he was tiny.

332
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:06,200
Hey, if you say that,

333
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,633
it was not for me, but for Seung Eon.

334
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,767
This sly girl!

335
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,367
- Look at this cunning lady.
- You know my family's situation.

336
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,033
No.

337
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:20,933
I have to marry the person
my father has chosen for me.

338
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,567
But the only excuse to avoid that was to study.

339
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,633
Now, my doctorate is almost finished.

340
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,000
But did you know

341
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,533
Seung Eon went to find you
with a bouquet of flowers?

342
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:43,067
- Really?
- A really big one.

343
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:47,100
Someone said they saw him at the library.

344
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,400
So it was true.

345
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll really push you forward, just trust me.

346
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,000
In return, you help me out, too.

347
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,933
What?

348
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:10,367
I really wanted to have
such a normal date like this.

349
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,667
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

350
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,467
Then shall we do it every day from now on?

351
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,733
I like it.

352
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,567
What else should we do?

353
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,733
We walk every day too.

354
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,500
Hey, do you like it? Do you?

355
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,600
- It's good!
- It's good!

356
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,667
- To your position!
- To your position!

357
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,167
What do you want to do?

358
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,833
Before Kang Hee goes to Seoul,
we should make a lot of memories.

359
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,033
- We need to make them.
- We need to make them.

360
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:48,267
If Kang Hee tells you to die, you would?

361
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:50,000
- I should die then.
- I should die then.

362
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,900
Why? Why the quarrel? Shall we have a match?

363
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,867
Just like old times.

364
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,267
To your position.

365
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,767
It looks too strong.

366
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,400
Yong Su, where are you going?

367
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,800
My clothes are brand new.

368
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:17,933
Let's have another round
next time, including Min Goo.

369
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,133
Yeon Soo, shall we go take pictures?

370
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,233
Good idea.

371
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,400
I can't believe I carried the bags
for such cowards for a year.

372
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,467
Ah, I'm really ashamed.

373
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,033
Are you embarrassed?

374
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
Why is she hanging out with them
after leaving that rich guy aside?

375
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,900
That's what I'm saying.

376
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,167
Mind your own business.

377
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,667
If she gets dumped by that guy,
it's her loss. Whatever.

378
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,233
Hey, you guys go ahead.

379
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:49,267
Where are you going?

380
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,867
Why?

381
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:54,433
Leave it. Let's go.

382
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,500
There's something I want to try.

383
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,533
Me too.

384
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,100
I want to go first.

385
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,800
I think I know what it is.

386
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,633
What is it?

387
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,967
It's not that.

388
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,467
What is it?

389
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,933
Can we decide on our titles?

390
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,967
Yes.

391
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,833
Oh, I like it.

392
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,767
How do you feel today?

393
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,933
A mess.

394
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm too embarrassed to go to Hana-eup.

395
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,767
Should I just go back to America?

396
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,500
Or should I take charge of the group's
planning as my father wished?

397
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,167
No.

398
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,700
You shouldn't do anything when your
emotions are fluctuating like this.

399
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Such important decisions should
be made with a calm mind.

400
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:57,933
You're the only one, my friend. Thank you.

401
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,767
Kang Hee is the one who rejected the offer.

402
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,933
Seok Kyeong, do you know
how great and cool you are?

403
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,533
That's enough, okay?

404
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,933
Do you have the right to say
that after rejecting me?

405
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,133
Hey, speak properly.

406
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:15,500
It's not that I didn't want to marry you,
I said I didn't want an arranged marriage.

407
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,000
That's the same.

408
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,867
The words "I don't want an arranged marriage"

409
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,767
meant that you should have confessed to me.

410
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Release balloons, scatter flowers,

411
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,933
get down on one knee and offer a ring.

412
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:35,233
Propose to me in a very childish way,
just like you did to Ms. Kang Hee.

413
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:38,500
That's what you meant by proposing.

414
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,967
Hey!

415
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,133
Don't lie.

416
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:46,733
That's a lie.

417
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,300
Little Heart,

418
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,833
Mom's first love is heartbroken
and in despair, you know?

419
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,967
You need to cheer him up.

420
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,467
Get up, let's go.

421
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,100
You feel better when
you spend money, don't you?

422
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,533
Isn't this pretty?

423
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,933
- Is this for 24 months?
- Yes.

424
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,300
Hey, this is so cute.

425
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,333
Little Heart, this really…

426
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,367
That's really funny.

427
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,233
Please take it from here.

428
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,300
Tell your driver to come,
don't carry it yourself.

429
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,633
- Where are you going?
- Just a moment.

430
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,233
It's a heart, a heart, isn't it cute?

431
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:39,000
You're so cute.

432
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,233
You got something here.

433
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,533
Victor, are you okay?

434
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:45,867
Do you know this guy is married?

435
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,733
Are you crazy? Do you know this person?

436
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,233
Victor.

437
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:02,400
Say hello.

438
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,267
Emily, I'm really sorry.

439
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,167
My friend misunderstood the situation.

440
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:11,100
Seok Kyeong, this is Victor's cousin.

441
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,433
I invited her to my house
since she's come to Korea.

442
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:18,067
Esther, how about this?

443
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:19,967
It's really pretty, isn't it?

444
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,100
You should stop hanging around with Esther.

445
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,533
How long do I have to put up with this?

446
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,967
I also came to buy a gift for Little Heart.

447
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,200
Why are you buying clothes for our baby?

448
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,300
It's upsetting. Please don't do it, okay?

449
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,000
There's still a lot of hay.

450
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,933
Oh, dear! It's better to prepare
in advance since it's getting colder.

451
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:51,967
I'll help out too.

452
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,467
No, it's heavy.

453
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,767
It's no big deal.

454
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:56,767
Ah, it's a bit heavy.

455
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,767
See, I told you it's heavy.

456
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:06,400
Thank you, Han Woo.

457
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,500
Chil Ddaeng is doing well, right?

458
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,667
Ah, of course. Thanks to you, she's very well.

459
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,967
If you're curious, come
check the blog sometimes.

460
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,033
I'm already following it.

461
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,467
- Oh, you are?
- Of course.

462
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,367
Of course, I'm interested.
Chil Ddaeng was my first patient.

463
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,500
At first, I thought Chil Ddaeng was the name.

464
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
But it turned out to be an ear tag.

465
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,700
Right, number 77, Chil Ddaeng.

466
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,533
Number 38 is Sampal Gwangttaeng.

467
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,900
Ah, that one is quite a troublemaker.

468
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,067
Ah, Sa Cheonsa is really funny.

469
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:34,200
Oh, really? I should post more often then?

470
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,767
Ah, Ms. Yoon…

471
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,667
I've heard about it from Yeon Soo.

472
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,800
It must be very hard for you, isn't it?

473
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,967
The truth is, breakups, they say,
are forgotten by meeting someone else,

474
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,133
but it hurts.

475
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:50,200
No, you said you heard it from the director.

476
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,067
Yes.

477
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,333
Actually,

478
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,233
we were not even dating.

479
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,567
Is Yeon Soo inside?

480
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,800
Why?

481
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,433
What do you want?

482
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,800
Did you use Ms. Yoon?

483
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,967
Does it feel good making a fool out of someone?

484
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:19,533
You should have at least told me.

485
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,267
Hey, how could I fall for another
woman besides Kang Hee?

486
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,333
Ah, that darn Ji Kang Hee!

487
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,500
Hey, what about me?

488
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,100
Aren't we best friends?

489
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,133
I've supported the two of you so much.

490
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,167
You have no idea how disappointed I am, do you?

491
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,433
But then again, what does that matter to you?

492
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,900
Every day it's just Ji Kang Hee, Ji Kang Hee.

493
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,033
Cut it out!

494
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:43,767
From today on, it's over between you and me.

495
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,967
Hey, I'll apologize properly. Just stand there.

496
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:49,167
What a load of crap! I'm going home.

497
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,533
Because I can't stand the sight of you.

498
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,900
You're banned from entering
our family farm for life.

499
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,533
Hey, Han Woo! Hey!

500
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,600
Hey, let's talk for a minute.

501
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,300
That's not like you.

502
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,133
Your mom has stopped eating
and drinking for days now.

503
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:05,800
She hasn't said a word like someone
with aphasia, and now I can't even reach her.

504
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,333
She is not answering your calls?

505
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,433
It's like nobody knows whether
she is alive or dead.

506
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:14,067
Yeon Soo, I didn't expect this from you.

507
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,367
I'll give it a try.

508
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:24,433
<i>The phone is disconnected, please leave…</i>

509
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,967
You shouldn't be sleeping.

510
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,900
Yes.

511
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:02,100
You see, I have a son.

512
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,867
He's been a good kid from his childhood,
and never caused any trouble.

513
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:11,867
He met the wrong woman,
and now he's planning to leave me.

514
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,567
What should I do?

515
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:20,467
You know, things with children
don't always go as planned.

516
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:23,867
As the saying goes,

517
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:28,667
"a game of go-stop and children
don't always turn out as you want".

518
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,900
Do respectable people
like you also play go-stop?

519
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,833
I'm someone whose heart
wavers at the sight of flowers.

520
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,600
Go-stop, what's that? It's hwatu.

521
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,300
What is Hwatu?

522
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,467
Isn't it a battle of flowers?

523
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,367
It's also my field of expertise.

524
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,467
He's a gambler.

525
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,833
Why do you talk like that?

526
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:06,833
I'll be back.

527
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,667
Kang Hee.

528
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,700
What is it?

529
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,633
Why are you here?

530
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:27,567
I came to take care of you, sit down quickly.

531
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,167
You like yogurt, don't you?

532
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,900
Since it's morning, I've prepared
something light, with no fat.

533
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,967
I heard that even people on diet
eat a lot of this nowadays.

534
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:42,100
I'm touched.

535
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,167
Slow down.

536
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,167
It looks delicious.

537
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,200
I will eat well.

538
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,700
Is it good?

539
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,233
Yes, it's delicious.

540
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:11,200
The person who used to put yogurt
in my desk drawer every morning.

541
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,467
Of course, it was me.

542
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:16,533
That's why I came to like this yogurt.

543
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,333
Me too.

544
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,900
- Kang Hee?
- Yes?

545
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,767
Instead of secretly hiding like this,

546
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:29,533
I want to take care of you every day.

547
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:32,667
How about we just stop thinking and go for it?

548
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,800
Risking all the whispers and gossip,

549
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,700
shall we just hold hands and face it head-on?

550
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,167
Okay, let's do that.

551
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,800
Are you busy today?
<i>[*Similar to "share a room for tonight"]</i>

552
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,567
I misunderstood.

553
00:35:58,567 --> 00:35:59,800
Are you busy today?

554
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,933
Not busy at all.

555
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,033
There are really a lot of pretty things.

556
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,467
You can choose something
expensive. I pay with my savings.

557
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,033
I don't like it.

558
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:17,400
I am going to buy the prettiest one here.

559
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:20,033
Please show me this.

560
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,900
How much is this?

561
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,833
It's the cheapest here.

562
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,133
You are thrifty, miss.

563
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:34,333
It's not bad, but wouldn't it be prettier
with something embedded like this?

564
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,733
I think this is the prettiest?

565
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,933
Try it on.

566
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,233
- What is this?
- Together.

567
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,667
I will buy you something better later.

568
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,833
Your thought is enough.

569
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:05,400
Wow! I didn't expect
Ji Kang Hee to be so cliché.

570
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,800
It's classic.

571
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,900
Anyway, this conversation ends here.

572
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,233
One more time and I'll kiss you.

573
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,533
Right now?

574
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,900
Oh my, look over there.

575
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,900
- Kang Hee?
- Oh my, goodness.

576
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,900
No way.

577
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,900
- No way.
- Why?

578
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,067
Eat some bread.

579
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,067
Let's eat together.

580
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,667
A man's whim all passes.

581
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,933
Just a blink and then you open your eyes.

582
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:46,400
Out of sight, out of mind.

583
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,000
Kang Hee will leave soon,
so just bear with it a little.

584
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,367
Ah, Su Ji likes you so much.

585
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:57,867
For the sake of our Su Ji, please
look after Yeon Soo just once?

586
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,733
There has been a misunderstanding.

587
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:04,033
I have never dated the director.

588
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,967
It was just a rumor.

589
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:09,667
Ms. Yoon, this is holding grudges.

590
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,267
Your pride must have been hurt.

591
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,933
I understand.

592
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,467
Start from the beginning again?

593
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:20,900
Ms. Yoon, it's a big deal.

594
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,400
Chil Ddaeng suddenly collapsed.

595
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,433
I would like you to come with me.

596
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,133
But, Chil Ddaeng seems fine.

597
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:34,633
The fur is in good condition,
and so is the nutrition.

598
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:37,133
And the mood…

599
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,300
Seems good, doesn't it?

600
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,967
Ah, but…

601
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:47,167
Do cows normally do that? I mean,

602
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:51,067
shouldn't the cow's tail be a bit more lively?

603
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:56,500
I mean, the tails of healthy cows
should be somewhat more…

604
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,767
The tail seems a bit too tame.

605
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:00,133
What is that?

606
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,600
That's why it is like that.

607
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,433
Why do you come home and
upset your mother's peace?

608
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:07,500
Father.

609
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,200
Don't just look for animal welfare,

610
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,900
try to address elderly welfare first.

611
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,967
Father, Ms. Yoon is also here.

612
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:17,467
Oh, my! Can't you have some
consideration and live properly?

613
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:21,600
Gosh, I've never seen such
happy cows before, sir.

614
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,433
It seems that the Han Woo has a kind
and upright character just like his father.

615
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:29,600
Well, he is refined.

616
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:35,067
His father supports his dream,
that's why he lives so wonderfully.

617
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:36,567
You are amazing, sir.

618
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:38,367
Awesome!

619
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,200
Please go, Dad.

620
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,267
Thank you.

621
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,600
You saved me at the hospital earlier, right?

622
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
No, wasn't it you who saved me
from my father earlier?

623
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,367
- Thank you.
- No, I'm grateful.

624
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,400
Are you okay?

625
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,267
I'm sorry.

626
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,133
- I'm sorry.
- I apologize.

627
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,933
Would you like to talk
in my room before you go?

628
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:26,700
No.

629
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,367
Are you tired? Go inside and sleep quickly.

630
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:32,133
Let's go to my room to talk.

631
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:33,600
- Hm?
- In your room

632
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,867
the security is lax, isn't it?

633
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,033
Is that so?

634
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,833
Let's go.

635
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:58,800
Why the light?

636
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,467
What are you doing?

637
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,067
Fine, do it with the light on.

638
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:05,333
Huh? What's this? It's not working.

639
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,833
- Stay still.
- Don't do it, this is home.

640
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,200
Do it at home, or outside?

641
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,033
Are you that type?

642
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,100
Cheon Yeon Soo, it's bold, isn't it?

643
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,333
Don't tease me. What if
someone comes like last time?

644
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,500
Who's coming?

645
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:24,267
Okay. If you say not to do it, I won't do it.

646
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:26,300
I'll wait for you.

647
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,633
Since we won't do it,

648
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:38,167
come here.

649
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,533
Kang Hee!

650
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,833
Kang Hee, come out.

651
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's go.

652
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,833
Let's go.

653
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,533
What's going on at this time of night?

654
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,600
She has no socks. It's cold outside.

655
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
Please rest.

656
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:43,200
Come out after a moment,
I'll give you what you need.

657
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,233
Thank you.

658
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:05,700
Give me a glass too.

659
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:12,500
Thank you.

660
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:15,767
Sorry for worrying you.

661
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,867
I can't take it anymore
because of my mom, really.

662
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,833
I'm going crazy because of my mom too, really.

663
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:34,200
She's been protesting
by not contacting me for days.

664
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,833
A few days? That's cute.

665
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:40,633
My mom left me here and went away.

666
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:43,633
What is this, a battle?

667
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:50,567
My mom ran away, abandoned me and then died.

668
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,633
This is mine, right?

669
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:58,967
It's not over yet.

670
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,533
The kind and noble principal you all know

671
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,967
is a domestic abuser.

672
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,633
I heard my mom has been beaten
since before I was born.

673
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:19,267
But she's holding out because
she says she won't divorce.

674
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:22,967
She said she wouldn't
divorce until I'm married.

675
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,767
Thank you.

676
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,833
I'm going to see my mom now.

677
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
Go inside.

678
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,700
Okay.

679
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,000
When is Mr. Chun Pil coming back?

680
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,567
Go upstairs.

681
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:45,233
<i>Oh, daughter.</i>

682
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:47,400
Mr. Chun Pil, where are you?

683
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,633
When are you coming back?

684
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:52,267
<i>Were you here? I found you.</i>

685
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:54,133
Ms. Hwang?

686
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,967
- Ms. Hwang?
<i>- Go inside.</i>

687
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,433
Are you okay on your own?

688
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:12,367
But why do you keep treating me like I'm sick?

689
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,767
I'm fine, I came to get tested.

690
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:19,300
Since you're uncomfortable, I'll go back.

691
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,200
- I'll come tomorrow.
- You don't have to come.

692
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,400
I will come.

693
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,233
- Pardon?
- Never mind.

694
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:28,033
Please, go back.

695
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:33,133
- Then…
- Yes.

696
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:47,200
<i>Dad, don't be sick.</i>

697
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,400
Oh dear, did you call to make Dad cry?

698
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,267
Hang up quickly. The phone bill will be huge.

699
00:46:53,267 --> 00:46:55,733
My daughter, I love you.

700
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:58,767
<i>- Got it.</i>
- Dad will get better soon.

701
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,367
<i>Talk soon.</i>

702
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,367
Take care.

703
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:07,367
I'm sorry, you should be sleeping.

704
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:10,467
My daughter is overseas,
thus the time difference.

705
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:13,100
It's okay, don't worry about it.

706
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,467
I also just spoke with my daughter.

707
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,533
Was that your wife earlier?

708
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,867
No, she's a friend.

709
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,167
My wife has gone on a trip far away.

710
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,233
<i>Honey.</i>

711
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,700
<i>Mia.</i>

712
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,700
<i>Mia, Mia.</i>

713
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,000
<i>Welcome to Hotel California.</i>

714
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,433
<i>Such a lovely place.</i>

715
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:50,067
<i>Such a lovely place.</i>

716
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,667
<i>Let's go to California.</i>

717
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:55,833
<i>Mia, that's the place you
wanted to go so much, California.</i>

718
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:58,200
<i>This time, our whole family is going together.</i>

719
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,967
<i>We'll go and show it to Kang Hee as well.</i>

720
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:04,900
<i>This time we're spending
Christmas in California.</i>

721
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,867
<i>How about it? Nice, right?</i>

722
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,700
<i>This time, I…</i>

723
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,800
<i>This time, when I go to Seoul,</i>

724
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,100
<i>I'll definitely buy a plane
ticket and come back.</i>

725
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,033
<i>You can trust me this time.</i>

726
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:17,733
<i>This time it's for real.</i>

727
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:20,100
<i>I promise you, okay?</i>

728
00:48:41,467 --> 00:48:44,333
Thanks to you, I arrived.

729
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:49,367
Is this a donkey managed by the clinic?

730
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:54,567
It looks just like Julie,
whom I raised in San Francisco.

731
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:56,833
Did you raise a donkey?

732
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,133
Yes.

733
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:02,400
It's a bit small for a miniature breed.

734
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,233
It's a child abandoned by its owner,
so we're looking for a place to send it.

735
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:09,233
Oh dear, that's unfortunate.

736
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:11,667
May I take it with me?

737
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,233
Oh, right…

738
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,733
I should introduce myself.

739
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,067
I happened to be passing by
to drive your mother,

740
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:24,000
and I just met eyes with this donkey.

741
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,967
Our eyes locked so deeply.

742
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,567
Come by with your mother,

743
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:31,467
and check if the conditions
are fit for raising a donkey.

744
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:33,767
Well then, that's all.

745
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,900
Take care.

746
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:51,467
Who is that person?

747
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:55,500
Who are you? Do you know me?

748
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:00,433
Mom.

749
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:05,633
Mom, please at least unblock me.

750
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,231
That worked out well.

751
00:50:19,231 --> 00:50:21,500
I was just about to say hello and leave.

752
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Where are you going?

753
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,667
Seoul.

754
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:27,133
I need to confirm the order,
but I can't reach Director Geum.

755
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:28,933
I'm thinking of going there myself.

756
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:31,100
Do you really have to go?

757
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:34,933
Wait.

758
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,767
Hand.

759
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,633
Come back quickly.

760
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:51,500
I don't know what it is, but cheer up.

761
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,766
And wait for me.

762
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:57,366
Okay, I'll take good care of the house.

763
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,266
Director.

764
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:17,966
Your phone was turned off.

765
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:26,800
I've confirmed the order.
When will you come to the site?

766
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,866
I'll see.

767
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,766
This.

768
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,933
I'll go back and take a look.

769
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,733
It's my first time

770
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,700
seeing the director like that.

771
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,955
It's the same for me.

772
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,300
Maybe,

773
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,533
it's probably the shock, as it is
the first time he has lost in a competition.

774
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,300
He'll overcome it.

775
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,900
Because he is a bright and pleasant person.

776
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,666
The truth is, he is not
really the competitive type.

777
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,733
"Can't do it? Okay, I won't then."

778
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:28,466
He has always been like this.

779
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:31,266
It's also the first time I've seen it.

780
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:34,333
It seems he liked you a lot.

781
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:40,166
I'm not too worried because he has you.

782
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:44,166
This time, even I am of no use.

783
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,433
I gave the driver a vacation
on purpose, you know?

784
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:50,033
Seok Kyeong was trying to get a ride
using that as an excuse.

785
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,366
He says he dislikes driving.

786
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:57,500
Let's go, I will give you a ride.

787
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:08,666
We've arrived.

788
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:11,033
Thank you.

789
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,700
Oh? It's Victor.

790
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,000
He's with Emily.

791
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,366
Who is it?

792
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:20,100
Victor's cousin.

793
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,933
No…

794
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:50,233
Get out. Hurry and get out, Esther.

795
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,833
I'll go in full speed.

796
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,033
What's wrong?

797
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,066
We'll go to the hospital first.

798
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,366
- It's so delicious.
- Chun Pil.

799
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:23,333
Oh, you're here?

800
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,000
Eat.

801
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,866
Tell him about Kang Hee.

802
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:28,333
I'm telling you to talk about it now.

803
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,066
Hurry up and go! Hurry!

804
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,900
Go, quickly.

805
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:36,066
It's about Kang Hee.

806
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,900
Speak, it's okay.

807
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,633
You didn't know Kang Hee was proposed
to by a man living in Seoul, did you?

808
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:46,766
The neighborhood was in quite an uproar.

809
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:49,366
To have received such a grand proposal, and

810
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:51,933
in the meantime, while that man
went to Seoul, she and Yeon Soo…

811
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:53,266
I see.

812
00:54:53,266 --> 00:54:56,066
Why do you talk about it with such excitement?

813
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:58,300
I understood.

814
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,733
No.

815
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:02,033
Su Ji will hear about it soon, too.

816
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:04,666
I thought you should know.

817
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:07,233
Okay, I got it.

818
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,633
Shall I call Ms. Kang Hee up to Seoul?

819
00:55:17,633 --> 00:55:20,900
There's a lot of work
for her at the headquarters.

820
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,100
No.

821
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:28,066
Even so, the last memories
at Hana-eup, it shouldn't be like that.

822
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:30,033
Yes.

823
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:34,600
You said it's Kang Hee's first
time as a field manager, right?

824
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,833
- Yes.
- But that girl

825
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:42,600
is struggling alone in Seoul.

826
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,100
She built her career with difficulty.

827
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,133
Don't we have something
like an opening ceremony?

828
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:54,766
Of course, we're planning to do it
splendidly with a rooftop pool party.

829
00:55:56,133 --> 00:56:00,200
Actually, it would be really nice if
Kang Hee was the main character that day.

830
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,933
Kang Hee could remember
Hana-eup with that memory.

831
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:06,866
And the people of Hana-eup as well,

832
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,600
will remember Kang Hee
as a successful designer.

833
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,000
Yes, Mr. Chun Pil.

834
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,833
I was short-sighted.

835
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,933
No, not at all.

836
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:21,266
Chun Pil!

837
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:25,100
Chun Pil!

838
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,900
Then, I will go to the construction site.

839
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,466
Yes, take care.

840
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:40,500
Stay still.

841
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,633
You heard that, too?

842
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:47,700
What I was worried about has finally happened.

843
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,233
What are you going to do now?

844
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,566
What is there to do about it?

845
00:56:51,566 --> 00:56:53,933
Just have to cut it off!

846
00:56:53,933 --> 00:56:58,266
I heard that the hotel heir
has proposed to Kang Hee.

847
00:56:58,266 --> 00:57:02,500
She should live comfortably in Seoul
with that man. Why is she seeing Yeon Soo?

848
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,400
No, even to the point of being
pointed at by the people in this town.

849
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,400
What honor is there to gain?

850
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,900
It's about Kang Hee,

851
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,000
who is a top-notch interior designer.

852
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,600
What synergy could possibly come out
of seeing a countryside veterinarian?

853
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,866
What!

854
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:23,333
Are you saying that Yeon Soo
is lacking right now, Chun Pil?

855
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,666
No, that's not what I mean.

856
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:29,000
I have experience, right?

857
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,166
Forced into a marriage
that was opposed, you know.

858
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:34,066
After Kang Hee's mother
had a tough married life.

859
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:37,400
Hey, just thinking about that makes me really…

860
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:43,233
Rather than have you mistreat her,
I'd rather send Kang Hee up to Seoul.

861
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:45,900
Hey, be honest.

862
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,866
You are not sure to treat Kang Hee well.

863
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:50,366
Are you sure that you won't mistreat her?

864
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,266
There shouldn't have been
such a situation in the first place!

865
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:54,433
That's why!

866
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:58,166
I'll settle things well, so it doesn't happen.

867
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:00,200
Don't get involved.

868
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,466
I trust you.

869
00:58:01,466 --> 00:58:04,500
Ah, don't worry, Soon Ja.

870
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,466
Su Ji.

871
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:08,033
I think you just need to check this part.

872
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:10,033
Yes, I will take action right away.

873
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:12,233
- Yes.
- Yes.

874
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:13,866
You all have worked hard.

875
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,933
Yes, thank you.

876
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,566
When did you arrive?

877
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:23,866
She has been here since earlier,
looking around everywhere.

878
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,000
Oh, you came?

879
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,333
Ms. Hwang!

880
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,133
You came without notice?

881
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:30,033
What's the big deal, between us?

882
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:34,266
It feels like a mother-in-law is coming in
to inspect the house while it's empty.

883
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:36,300
The mother-in-law went too far.

884
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,233
- How about Mom?
- Sorry?

885
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:41,233
Kang Hee.

886
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:42,300
I'm your mom…

887
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,366
Ew! Ms. Hwang, that's gross!

888
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:47,600
Aren't you cold?

889
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,533
Wear something like a muffler.

890
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:52,166
What about the one I gifted you?

891
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:55,200
It seems to turn out even better than expected.

892
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,266
Suffer a little bit more.

893
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,666
Next time you come,
please wear a padded jacket,

894
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,833
- It's cold.
- Yes.

895
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:02,466
I'll treat you to a company dinner before I go.

896
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:03,766
Find a place.

897
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:05,200
Just give me the card.

898
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,266
It's burdensome if you come along.

899
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:09,000
Is that so?

900
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,100
Then, we'd have to listen to the manager.

901
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,000
Got it.

902
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:40,033
That's right, it belongs to President Hwang.

903
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,800
Did you go on the trip with the president?

904
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,700
Well, we are both adults, after all.

905
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,866
Who's saying what?

906
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:51,900
Can't I even ask?

907
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,766
Then, can I ask something too?

908
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,500
If I don't see President Hwang,
can you also not see Yeon Soo?

909
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,600
Mr. Chun Pil.

910
01:00:08,266 --> 01:00:11,733
The question is a bit raw.

911
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,633
Knock, knock.

912
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:32,166
Mister.

913
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,400
Welcome. Have you been well?

914
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,166
No. Kang Hee and I missed you a lot.

915
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,100
Really?

916
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,500
I heard the rumors.

917
01:00:46,133 --> 01:00:47,600
You'll support us, right?

918
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,833
We don't know about others,
but you're on our side.

919
01:00:54,366 --> 01:00:55,900
Mister.

920
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,200
Living, I've realized life is really short.

921
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,800
Yeon Soo, don't live a hard life.

922
01:01:04,866 --> 01:01:07,466
Are you saying this because you're
worried Kang Hee might struggle?

923
01:01:07,466 --> 01:01:10,100
Don't worry, I might go to Seoul.

924
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,200
I also know how much you like Hana-eup.

925
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,866
I also know very well how much
Kang Hee dislikes Hana-eup.

926
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:22,533
I don't like it when you guys have a hard time.

927
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:24,500
Mister.

928
01:01:29,633 --> 01:01:33,700
He hasn't been a dad since I was ten,
what has he been doing all this time?

929
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,366
Is he pretending to be a dad now?

930
01:01:36,366 --> 01:01:38,966
I'm just dumbfounded.

931
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,633
What should we do?

932
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:42,300
What do you mean, "what should we do"?

933
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,233
I didn't know your father would object.

934
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,200
Just ignore it.

935
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:50,900
So what? Should I see you
because your mother agrees?

936
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
That's true, though.

937
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,233
You'll take responsibility for me, right?

938
01:01:59,566 --> 01:02:01,766
I don't want to go home.

939
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:11,700
Then, shall we go to Seoul?

940
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:16,833
Just for the sake of it, let's go
for a drive and get some fresh air.

941
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,200
And finish what we haven't done.

942
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,800
Okay.

943
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,866
You be prepared.

944
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:24,233
You be prepared!

945
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:30,400
Then let me just check on the animals
one last time before we go.

946
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,466
If you need to pack anything,
pack it and come out.

947
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:33,966
See you at the parking lot in 30 minutes.

948
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:35,866
Okay.

949
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,700
See you later.

950
01:02:57,266 --> 01:02:59,000
You

951
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,400
think you win against me?

952
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:04,633
Eventually,

953
01:03:04,633 --> 01:03:07,633
you'll be punished by heaven,
just like your mother.

954
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:33,600
<i>Do you remember this?</i>

955
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,700
<i>Now, everyone, get ready.</i>

956
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,900
<i>Let's go.</i>

957
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:55,433
<i>I wished that this man was my father.</i>

958
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:58,133
<i>Because he always made Mom laugh.</i>

959
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,133
<i>Actually, me too.</i>

960
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:05,833
<i>I also wished that your mom was my mother.</i>

961
01:04:08,033 --> 01:04:10,366
<i>We've been accomplices since then.</i>

962
01:04:10,366 --> 01:04:12,300
<i>Indeed.</i>

963
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:21,833
<i>Is it okay for us to do this, Yeon Soo?</i>

964
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:31,666
<i>I'm sure both of them</i>

965
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,466
<i>would want us to be happy.</i>

966
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,733
<i>Don't worry.</i>

967
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:26,333
<i>- Please come out.
- It seems like a severe injury.</i>

968
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:28,466
Stop!

969
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,800
- What?
- There's been an accident.

970
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,600
Where?

971
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,800
Pull over!

972
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,166
Pull over!

973
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:02,433
Pulse and oxygen saturation
seem to be all right.

974
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:03,633
There's no consciousness.

975
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:06,133
Prepare for brain CT and also
conduct a blood test, please.

976
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:08,000
Yes.

977
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,133
<i>You'll be punished by heaven,
just like your mother.</i>

978
01:06:33,733 --> 01:06:35,733
<i>Is it okay for us to do this, Yeon Soo?</i>

979
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:37,566
<i>[Motel California]</i>
