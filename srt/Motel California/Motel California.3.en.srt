<i>If that's true,</i>

11
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:56,100
<i>I'm ashamed to have accepted such behavior for over 10 years as the boss.</i>

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,933
<i>Hey, don't swear.</i>

13
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,500
<i>It's not Kang Hee's fault.</i>

14
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:04,533

- On what?</i>

20
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:22,800
<i>I... am going to lose weight!</i>

21
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,433

22
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:29,030
<i>I can do it!</i>

23
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:36,433
<i>I'll lose weight, become handsome, and go to see Kang Hee again.</i>

<i>Yeon Soo, it seems this life is a mistake.</i>

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,867
<i>Until that day comes, no carbonated drinks whatsoever.</i>

26
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,400
<i>Gods, what a waste.</i>

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,600
<i>Not long ago, you said Kang Hee would kill you if you lost weight and ate ramen every night.</i>

Have we met before?

70
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,433
I said let's get out of here quickly.

71
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:16,067
Ten years ago, we met once.

72
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,667
If it was ten years ago…

73
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:22,900
When she was working at the convenience store, you recorded a video...

74
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,933
of the boss who didn't pay and verbally abused her.

75
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,833
That was you then, right?

76
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,567
See, I told you we definitely met before.

78
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,433
You knew all along, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

79
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,667
Then why did you pretend not to know me?

80
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:51,067
When did I say anything about transferred ownership?

81
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,900
My ownership is mine. I won't give it to anyone.

82
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,500
Yes, this! This is the expression I fell for.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,867
This look in your eyes, this hair color.

84
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,700
I'm telling you, this just can't be replicated.

85
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,367
I won't let you go until I hear an answer, so tell me.

86
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,467
Why did you pretend not to know me?

87
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,900
I don't like working with people from the past.

88
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh, that's exciting.

89
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,233
I really like that answer.

90
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,433
Then let's talk about the future, not the past.

91
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:27,600
You're heading up, right?

92
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,000
I was on my way down.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm not going to the after-party.

94
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,000
I won't take you along. No need to ruin the mood there.

95
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,500
Let's work together.

- Merry Christmas.

<i>The door is closing.</i>

102
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,300
Ah, this is all because of that Chun Pil.

103

Oh, wonderful daughter, happy birthday.

104
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Um, that is… I mean…

105
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,100
Yeon Soo had something to tell you, begging and pleading…

106
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,767
That's what I did…

107
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,500
Hello, are you listening?

108
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,600
Our last Christmas together,

109
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,900
just know that you blew it off splendidly.

110
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,433
I will never contact you again.

111
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:18,110
Take care and live well, Mr. Chun Pil.

112
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,900
<i>Yeon Soo.</i>

113
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,267
<i>I wonder if Seoul is very cold too?</i>

114
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:53,133
<i>What if it's very cold?</i>

115
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,933
<i>If it's cold and tough,</i>

116
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:59,900
<i>come back anytime, Kang Hee.</i>

117
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,100
<i>I'll wait here.</i>

118
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:10,100
<i>Whenever that is, I'll just be waiting for you.</i>

119
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,333
Kang Hee.

120
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,033
I'm cold.

121
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,133
Who told you to show up, out of the blue?

122
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,733
Sorry.

123
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,233
Don't look at me like that.

124
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,333
I'm not going to hurt you.

125
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,233
Do you care for any wine?

126
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,067
I'm cold.

127
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,867
Ah, right?

128
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,267
I'll get you something warm.

129
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,833
Do you have chamomile?

130
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,700
Yes, take a seat and wait a moment.

131
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Thank you for coming that day.

132
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,967
Thanks to you, I bade my grandfather farewell.

133
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm sure grandfather was happy that you came.

134
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you think so?

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,200
All we ever did was fight.

136
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
It wasn't your fault.

137
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,267
- What happened?
- Huh?

138
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:01,967
Why are you here today?

139
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,933
It was your father's request.

140
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:10,433
That and... I've caught the first snow ten times.

141
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,133
Huh?

142
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,233
I said I'm ready.

143
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,533
Ready for what?

144
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,367
Anything.

145
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:27,600
You're saying you'll come to Seoul?

146
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,767
There's nothing I can't do.

147
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,467
Hey, aren't you a large animal veterinarian?

148
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,767
There are no cows in Seoul.

149
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,433
But you're here.

150
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,667
Purple Tok!

151
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,000
This?

152
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,533
It's the one you gave me, that day.

153
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,333
- Really?
- Yes.

154
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,400
Look at the expiration date.

155
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,533
This teddy bear…

156
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,800
No, you're not even a teddy bear anymore.

157
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,633
This is my favorite champagne.

158
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:36,167
Chun Pil gave it to me, saying it's a gift for you.

159
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,733
And you?

160
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,367
Don't you have a gift?

161
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,867
Surprise!

162
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:55,667
Lame...

163
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,800
Open it.

164
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,867
Isn't this something you should give to a girlfriend?

165
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,167
You know I don't have one.

166
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,933
How would I know? It's been 10 years.

167
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,633
You've changed so much.

168
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,400
I almost didn't recognize you.

169
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,733
I said I would wait.

170
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,633
For life.

171
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I said I'd only like you.

172
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,667
Let me try this on.

173
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,700
How is it?

174
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,500
Kang Hee.

175
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,333
Be honest, did you not miss me?

176
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,567
<i>Don't use that tone.</i>

177
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,800
I really wanted to see you.

178
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,567
<i>Don't smile like that.</i>

179
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:34,267
I thought about you all month, even dreamed about you.

180
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,533
Don't joke like that, it makes my heart flutter.

181
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,900

192
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,567
I don't want to take it.

193
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,067

<i>[Mom]</i>

195
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,900

00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,667
What's wrong, Mom? Are you okay?

197
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,950
<i>Yeon Soo, here… it hurts.</i>

198
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,167
Wait a moment.

199
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,067
Merry Christmas.

200
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,150
<i>Her eyes are exactly like her mom's.</i>

201
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,010
<i>She'll hear you.</i>

202
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,660
<i>- That's fine.
- Her purse is obviously a fake.</i>

203
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,150
<i>She fled our town at night, just like her mom did. </i>

204
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,110
<i>To be honest, I pity her. </i>

205
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,870
<i>Her mutt gaze is just like it was before.</i>

206
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,110
<i>She was so obviously a mutt before,</i>

207
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,160
<i>but now that she's grown, you can't tell as easily.</i>

208
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,030
<i>The older she gets, the more she resembles her mom.</i>

209
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,350
<i>That's why Chun Ja or Chun Pil,</i>

210
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,980
<i>one of them should've left our town ages ago. </i>

211
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,850
<i>- Be quiet.
- What if she loses it again?</i>

212
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,920
<i>That's right. I told you it would be like this</i>

213
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,467
Sorry, did you wait long?

214
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,700
I remembered everything.

215
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,333
What did you remember?

216
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,933
Why I left.

217
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,500
You...

218
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,567
and I…

219
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,367
Why it didn't work.

220
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:03,500
Why didn't it work?

221
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,467
Save this for your girlfriend.

222
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,400

223
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,200
Hey, Ji Kang Hee.

224
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,667
If you go now,

225
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,600
I won't wait anymore.

226
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,633
That's what I've been hoping for.

227
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,533
Our first love...

228

229
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,300
The end.

230
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,433
Are you serious?

231
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:18,800
Let's live well separately.

232
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,967

00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,667
I put up with it and when I finally went there,

251
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:55,067
this lady came out with her eyes this big.

252
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:58,130
Are you going to report the assault, ma'am?

253
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,533
Me? No, it wasn't me.

254
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,400
I just fell over.

255
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
No, I filed a report because of this condition.

256
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,733
Do you beat people up like that for filing a report, huh?

257
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:15,600
And in front of kids?

258
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,867
You admit it, right?

259
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:19,300
Oh, I don't remember.

260
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,433
Yes, I saw everything.

261
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:25,967
Sir, just once, please make an exception just once.

262

263
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,233
How much longer will you live like this, getting hit?

264
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,500
This man just did it in a moment of anger.

265
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,633
But deep down, he is really kind.

266
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,033
He is kind.

267
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:41,550
Sorry, but could I have a word alone with my mom?

268
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,067
- Yes.
- Just a moment.

269
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,533
Ah, I would also like to speak separately…

270
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,400
Sir, please sit down.

271
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,700
Take a seat.

272
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,700
- Sit down.
- No, I said sit down, quickly.

273
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,933
If there's a misunderstanding, solve it…

274
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,867
Sit down, sit down. Just sit down first.

275
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,100
Sit down and clear the misunderstanding.

276
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,733
No, I will sit.

278
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,067
- Mom.
- I need settlement money, Yeon Soo.

279
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:06,000
Did that rat hit you?

280
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,900
That rat?

281
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,633
Hey, watch your words, that's your father!

282
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,167
Your workshop salary,

283
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,367
you've saved some. Right? Lend me some, okay?

284
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:24,133
I'm asking you a question. Did you get hit?

285
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,000
Why can't you answer me? Why?

286
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,367
Yeon Soo.

287
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,767
What day is today?

288
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:33,433
Silent night, holy night.

289
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:39,067
On such a night, should loved ones part ways?

290
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:43,133
Let me stay with your dad for a while.

291
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,367
Okay? Please.

292
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:46,933
Ugh, it's cold.

293
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:48,467
Please.

294
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:51,633
Please, okay?

295
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,200
You don't have to do it.

296
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,967
Oh my, take care.

297
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,033

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,433
Let it be, will you?

301
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,333
Go there and buy some udon or something…

302
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,400
Go eat… hey, you!

303
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,433
I just wanted you to get a bowl of udon.

304
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,933
Yeon Soo, thank you.

305
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,033
Let's go. Are you hungry? What shall we eat?

306
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,600
Oh my, what?

307
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,367
<i>What should I do?</i>

308
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,800
That's upsetting.

00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:37,200
Happy 30th!

317
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:42,467
Today, you should avoid beef and just eat chicken.

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,033
Thank you.

321
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,600
How about starting with a salary of 30 million won? (~$21,000)

322
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,067
But there will be incentives for each project.

323
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:10,967
Well, there's a chance I won't get incentives.

324
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:13,433
It doesn't matter. I've wanted to try working on

325
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:18,400
the hotels and commercials that you, Director, I mean, CEO mostly handled.

326
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,367
Ms. Kang Hee.

327
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:26,567
Do you know what "aesthetic disharmony" means?

328
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,867
Pardon?

329
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,733
It refers to the estrangement between feeling genuinely beautiful

330
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:34,800
- and being forced to feel that way.
- Yes?

331
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,167
To be honest, I've felt that disconnection for a long time,

332
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,467
due to aesthetic disharmony.

333
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,933
Which is why I now want to do what I like.

334
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:46,667
What do you like?

335
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:47,933
Trot music.

336
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,900
Trot music?

337
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,367
How should I put it?

338
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:55,967
If the hotel is classic music, then trot is a motel?

339
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:58,000
I will not do it.

340
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,567
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

341
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,433
Yes, Mr. Hotel Heir?

342
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,133
This is Ji Kang Hee speaking.

343
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:18,833
Is the offer to work together still valid?

344
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,667
Hotels are okay, but motels aren't?

345
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:43,433
Was it all a scam, pretending to be a hotel heir?

346
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,100
You said so yourself.

347
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Your ownership rights are yours, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

348
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,067
After hearing that, I also came to claim my ownership. From my father.

349
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:55,267
I contacted you because I believed you were a hotel designer.

350
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:59,833
With the rapid growth of accommodation apps, the motel renovation market has expanded.

351
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,633
You can work much more dynamically and creatively than in hotels.

352
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,633
But after all, it's still a motel.

353
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,967
Why do you dislike motels so much?

354
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,900
- Because they are third-class.
- Pff!

355
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,833
Listen up, motel owners around the country…

356
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:15,633
Fine, let's say motels are third-class.

357
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,700
What's wrong with being third-class?

358
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,133
What would the son of a hotel owner know?

359
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,867
Unless you're the daughter of a motel owner, you wouldn't know.

360
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,167
You are the daughter of a motel owner?

361
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:29,167
Jackpot, Ms. Kang Hee.

362
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,633
That's really enviable.

363
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:38,467
If you live in a five-star hotel, do you think you'll become a five-star person?

364
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:42,333
I thought you had more than five-star charm, even if you were the daughter of a motel owner.

365
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,467
It's not that I'm the daughter of a motel owner, it's just that our home was a motel.

366
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:48,400
I was born in a motel, raised in a motel, all the way.

367
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,833
The way people stared at me while I was growing up.

368
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:54,033
Do you even know what I've been through?

369
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:58,767
When I was young, I didn't know any better and just… fell for my dad's words.

370
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,800
Nonsense.

371
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:13,900
<i>- Dad?
- Yes?</i>

372
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,567
<i>The kids won't hang out with me. Is it because motels are bad?</i>

373
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:19,367
<i>What?</i>

374
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:22,200
<i>What, who? Your friends say that?</i>

375
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,790
<i>I see...</i>

376
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,133
<i>Okay, Dad will explain. You need to listen closely.</i>

377
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:33,067
<i>Where do people go when they're hungry?</i>

378
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,967
<i>- A restaurant.
- Exactly.</i>

379
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:38,833
<i>When people are in need of sleep, where do they go? To a motel.</i>

380
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:42,267
<i>Why? Because they need a comfortable place to rest, right?</i>

381
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:45,267
<i>So, what should we do when such people come?</i>

382
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:49,300
<i>In a motel, we provide blankets, pillows,</i>

383
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,333
<i>and we can tell them, "Have a comfortable stay," "Sweet dreams."</i>

384
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,567
<i>That's what a motel is all about.</i>

385
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,367
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

386
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,800
<i>Oh, that sounds good.</i>

387
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,767
<i>Yeah, do you know what the most exciting thing at Motel California is?</i>

388
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:08,367
<i>Ramen, of course.</i>

389
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:09,567
<i>Want to eat some ramen?</i>

390
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,100
<i>Let's go! Dad will cook it for you.</i>

391
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,567
<i>The best ramen! Let's go.</i>

392
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:17,300
People don't come to the motel because they are sleepy, but just

393
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,900
to escape, to hide away.

394
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,233
In a word, it sucked.

395
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:25,933
Let's combine our efforts to change that perception.

396
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,167
For Ms. Kang Hee's father's sake, too.

397
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,900
My father passed away when I was ten.

398
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,267
So please, leave me out of it.

399
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,700
Ms. Kang Hee.

400
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,433
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

401
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,667
- I refuse.
- Okay.

402
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,433
Please open it.

403
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,967
What's the offer?

404
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,533
What's that?

405
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:13,333
<i>[Deposit 50,000,000 won, from Geum Seok Kyeong]</i>

406
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:16,633
<i>[Seongok Goshiwon]</i>

407
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:22,100
Bang, bang!

408
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,333
Father, why are you doing this all of a sudden?

409
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,100
That's really fast, that thing… Hey, come here, you.

410
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,867
Do you think I sold cattle and sent you to college for this?

411
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,633
I paid it all back, that thing.

412
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:52,433
Hey! If you're going to act all high and mighty, take the cattle you bought and get out.

413
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,700
No, please let me, Dad.

414
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,200
Ah, in the end… Won't you come here?

415
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,667
<i>Go ahead and talk like that in front of Mom.</i>

416
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,467
<i>Oh, really, Dad.</i>

417
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:02,067
- Come here!
- Testing. 1, 2.

418
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:05,567
What are you two doing, really?

419
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:08,567
- Why are you fighting out here, instead of under that nice roof of yours?
- Father, don't do it.

420
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,633
The cows want freedom, too.

421
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm telling you to come here.

422
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,000
<i>- Just over there…
- Come here, you.</i>

423
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,567
<i>Father, why are you really doing this?</i>

424
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:18,300
I didn't do this for you to… come here!

00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:45,733
You didn't act like this when Han Woo first came back. Why the fuss now?

431
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:48,867
I thought if it was too hard, he would give up and drop out, so I watched.

432
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,867
But it's becoming more and more of a spectacle.

433
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:54,433
A pasture? Animal welfare?

434
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:01,067
Do you remember the neighborhood feast when I first entered college?

435
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,667
It was worth doing.

436
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:05,600
The first one from Hana-eup to pass into Seoul National University, and it was into the law school.

437
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,500
When I gave up the civil service exam to run an inn,

438
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,000
do you remember me getting chased out of my house?

439
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,567
I even gave you a ride to the temple.

440
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,633
I still wonder...

441
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,633
how things would've turned out if my mom just accepted it.

442
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,667
Are you mocking me right now?

443
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,533
Did Han Woo ask you to take his side?

444
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,367
Honestly,

445
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:30,267
I envy you, Deok Gu.

446
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,233
Oh dear, I...

447
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,100
live without even seeing my daughter's face.

448
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,600
Even though I want to take sides,

449
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,233
I can't win against my wife.

450
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,367
No, a guy who used to dress sharply and was successful in Seoul

451
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,067
is just shoveling cow dung all day long now.

452
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,867
If I don't chase that guy away, I'll be the one getting chased away.

453
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:56,310
So that's why you're shorter than me.

454
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,033
Let go of your greed.

455
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:01,067
The best thing in life is to have your child by your side.

456
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,300
Yeah, I'm short, so what? And?

457
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,133
You've all had a hard time.

458
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:09,367
- You've worked hard.
- You've worked hard.

459
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,233
Oh, you two have done a great job.

460
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:13,833
Now, everyone have a cup of coffee.

461
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

462
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,600
Right, right, right.

463
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,500
Senior, today is the last day.

464
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,867
Congratulations on your discharge.

465
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:25,100
I'll be doing what I always do anyway, so we'll see each other often.

466
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,300
You said you're running a clinic in town.

467
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,567
The hospital my grandfather used to run.

468
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,467
Huh? Soon Ja came to sell that?

469
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,100
- What?
- You didn't know?

470
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,600
She even brought a broker.

471
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,833
You're buying a really good building.

472
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,633
Oh my, thanks to the president, I'm buying the building at a good price.

473
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:46,533
Now, we just need your son to come.

474
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,333
- Yes.
- Oh, right.

475
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,767
What are you doing right now?

476
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,100
Yeon Soo!

477
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,800
Yeon Soo, say hello, here…

478
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,733
The person buying the building, President Kim.

479
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,367
All the contracts have been written up, you know?

480
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,000
You just need to stamp here. Is this Yeon Soo's?

481
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,467
I'm not selling the hospital, so everyone, please leave.

482
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,767
You said it was yours.

483
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:10,767
Yeon Soo!

484
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:14,600
It's only in your name, but it's as good as mine.

485
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,200
Didn't you hear?

486
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,467
I said please leave.

487
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:22,567
I'm sorry, there has been a misunderstanding…

488
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,567
No, I…

489
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,467
You figure it out. Okay?

490
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,667
Yeon Soo.

491
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:43,467
Mom, I made a promise to Grandfather,

492
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,900
that I would take care of this hospital.

493
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,333
I inherited the hospital, not just the building.

494
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,467
Why did you leave the house?

495
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:57,633
Hey, how can you live there after all that fuss? So embarrassing!

496
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:01,700
Then, at least with that money, you shouldn't have gone on a Mediterranean trip.

497
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,733
That… It's been my dream since I was young.

498
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:07,767
Mom!

499
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,167
So what am I supposed to do?

500
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:12,567
Should I just live out on the streets with your dad?

501
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:20,690
Just come live with me at my house.

502
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,333
Ugh, no way!

503
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,400
I'm a newlywed.

504
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,667
How can I live in the same house with a grown son?

505
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,600
I don't want to.

506
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:33,767
I'll leave.

507
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,810
You said it's yours.

508
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,233
You said it was yours!

509
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,167
Enjoy your meal.

510
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,267
Hello.

511
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:57,900

Yes.

Why are you here?

531
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,500
Why do you look like that?

532
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,100
Look at this one. I need to set him straight today.

533
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,700
Agree? Let's go.

534
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,480
Put your luggage there and follow me.

535
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,367
Uncle, did you see that?

536
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,133
Wow, amazing!

537
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:47,900
- Wow, it's a hit?
- Good! Good!

538
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,467
Cha Seung Eon did it.

539
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,100
- You've worked hard, Seung Eon.
- You've worked hard.

540
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,233
You've worked hard.

541
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:02,000
- How about more?
- No, it's fine. Sit down quickly.

542
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,033
Well, these are thugs.

543
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:06,567
Just like this, the guys who were like that...

544
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,100
- We've grown a lot, haven't we?
- Yes.

545
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,233
These brats used to not even know how to use a spoon. Now they do all sorts of stuff.

546
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:13,667
But you guys, just wait a minute…

547
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:17,633
"Gangs family," you guys don't have an older one?

548
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:20,100
You're not in touch? Try calling her.

549
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,300
Right now.

550
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,267
Were you cut off? You…

551
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,833
- I cut Kang Hee off.
- Which part? Your own body?

552
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,567
That could be… The leg might have been cut off.

553
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:32,833
But seeing how you can't call her, you got cut off again, didn't you?

554
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,133
Oh dear.

555
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:36,133
Sir, you were also cut off.

556
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:40,067
Probably living well, I guess.

557
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,067
Well, calling her is like…

558
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:43,700
Bottles up.

559
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,833
- Nana!
- Let's do well!

560
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:53,100
<i>[Golden Gilt Studio]</i>

561
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,800
Miss Kang Hee.

562
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:01,633
Please choose a wallpaper color.

563
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:06,400
The pink you chose last time, Miss Kang Hee.

564
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,500
The clouds were a huge hit.

565
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,133
Someone posted in the review.

566
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:12,933
They say you don't need that medicine if you just go in there.

567
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:17,933
That pink is a bit, sensual, isn't it?

568
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,600
Ah, it's strange.

569
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
The colors chosen by Miss Kang Hee

570
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,333
seem a bit tacky at first, but strangely they catch on.

571
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,267
The photo shoots are also amazing.

572
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:29,867
How about this color?

573
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,500
Mountain Moose.

574
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,167
It matches the furniture well, and it seems it would make the skin tone look prettier, too.

575
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:37,767
Wow, it's perfect!

576
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:41,233
Just a moment.

577
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:44,733
I'm going to upload this to the website. Please take a look at the photo.

578
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:46,933
I like it.

579
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:50,767
The angle is good, and it looks spacious.

580
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,667
It would be nice if the temperature were adjusted.

581
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:58,280
It would seem cozier if you made the tone a bit warmer.

582
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,167
Miss Kang Hee, site survey.

583
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,600
Yes.

584
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,167
It seems more spacious than we anticipated, doesn't it?

585
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:16,467
Yes, the space seems well captured.

586
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,100
It's hot. Is it not?

587
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,000
Turn up the air conditioner a bit.

588
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,767
Is the air conditioner working or not?

589
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,333
It's coming out.

590
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:33,000
Anyway, the primary option here is to make it a business motel that mainly serves business travelers.

591
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,167
Is it possible?

592
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:38,467
It seems possible to have an open-front design.

593
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,900
Dining room or laundry room.

594
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,533
And I'll check if there's space for luggage storage services.

595
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,033
Okay!

596
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,800
Spicy?

597
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,533
Slightly spicy? Tastily spicy?

598
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:51,067
What was there like that…

599
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,200
Aren't you getting off?

600
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,200
What are you looking at?

601
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,900
What's the matter?

602
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,700
Excuse me.

603
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,033
Who is that man?

604
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:29,900
A classmate from my hometown.

605
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,167
"She was seen going in and out of motels," "Ji Kang Hee was already half undressed."

606
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,400
The rumors will spread far and wide, won't they?

607
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:40,400
- Get off.
- Why?

608
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,000
It's not true, we have to stop it.

609
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,300
It doesn't matter.

610
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,467
I have no reason to go back to such a hometown.

611
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:49,233
Let's go.

612
00:46:56,967 --> 00:47:00,900
I went to Seoul for fun today, and suddenly I got turned on.

613
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,333
So I went to a motel.

614
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:06,467
But guess who I ran into there?

615
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,833
Ji Kang Hee.

616
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,167
No, that girl…

617
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,100
She went to a motel with a man in broad daylight.

618
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,733
When the elevator doors opened,

619
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:17,333
a man and a woman were stuck together, just really.

620
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,567
That girl seemed to love it to death.

621
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:21,200
I knew this would happen.

622
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,000
This is why home education is important.

623
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,133
What would the daughter of a motel owner have seen growing up?

624
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,167
So what?

625
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:33,600
- What?
- And you? Didn't you go there, too?

626
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,633
Ha, you guys. Hey!

627
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:38,900
I'm telling you this because I care about our friendship.

628
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,267
Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo.

629
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:45,100
You're not still thinking of getting back with Ji Kang Hee, are you?

630
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,333
Wake up from your dream.

631
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,600
Hey!

632
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,933
Hey, listen carefully.

633
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:56,200
The moment you gossip again about Kang Hee,

634
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,700
especially if I hear something terrible, you're really going to die by my hands.

635
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,833
What's the matter, really? You want to get sued again?

636
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:05,133
Dude, why are you making a fuss? Hey, why is this guy like this?

637
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,433
Hey, Kim Heon Yeol.

638
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:10,467
You are really like the mad cow of our house, all hell breaks loose once you're let out.

639
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:13,500
It's cleaner to bury it with an excavator.

640
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,600
It's over with just one shovel.

641
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:21,200
Hey, if you guys get reported this time, I really can't handle it.

642
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,767
Ugh, look at that loser.

643
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,933
Anyhow, that really is bad luck.

644
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,867
That's really low quality, that one.

645
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:29,900
Hey, hey!

646
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,700
Let's have a drink.

647
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,933
Have a drink.

648
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:34,800
Kang Hee…

649
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,233
Did someone really come into her life?

650
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:40,833
- Ah, Seung Eon.
- Why?

651
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,967
Can't you just shut up for a moment, really?

652
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:45,733
What's that, why?

653
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:48,800
Hey, where are you going?

654
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,667
Where is he going?

655
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:53,633
Where are you going?

656
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,700
To console him, thanks to you.

657
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,100
You're talking such nonsense.

658
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,300
You pay and come out.

659
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,833
Why did you come? Stay with Seung Eon.

660
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,967
Are you okay?

661
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,833
No.

662
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:22,200
So you should meet someone else, punk.

663
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,533
It's not like that.

664
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:28,433
Thinking it must have been hard for Kang Hee.

665
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,900
I feel bad for wanting her to return. It was my selfishness.

666
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:38,233
Hey, if you're sorry, then listen to Kang Hee for once.

667
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:41,733
Hey, Ji Kang Hee said let's live well separately.

668
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:45,533
So let go of Kang Hee now, please?

669
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,167
What is it, you?

670
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,333
Why aren't you talking back?

671
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,500
I'm going in first.

672
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,500
I have a meeting.

673
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,200
What would have happened if I hadn't scouted Deputy Ji?

674
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,167
What? I was the one who made Ms. Kang Hee join.

675
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:16,100
I was the one who snapped her up from the field.

676
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,200
I was the one who picked Ms. Kang Hee's design.

677
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,267
No, it wasn't.

678
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,767
Ms. Kang Hee joined because of me.

679
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:23,800
Wanna bet?

680
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,000
Then, 100,000 won, even.

681
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:35,433
Take 100,000 won, and add another 100,000 won.

682
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,800
Are you joking?

683
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,533
All in!

684
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,433
If you're scared, go on in.

685
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,967
Shall we give it a try?

686
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,467
All-in!

687
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:53,233
All-in!

688
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,600
We are in the midst of a stake fight right now, you know?

689
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,333
Kang Hee, please sort this out.

690
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:03,167
When I sent the 50 million won to you.

691
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:04,833
That swayed your heart, right?

692
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:09,267
Not a chance. It was the proposal I made when you came to return that money, wasn't it?

693
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:14,167
It was me who made the drastic proposal, wasn't it?

694
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,733
Thanks to Coach Esther.

695
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:23,733
<i>You said you rejected the job offer, right?</i>

696
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:27,200
<i>If you've come to persuade me… you're wasting your time.</i>

697
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:32,700
<i>No? I came to commend you for doing well.</i>

698
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,833
<i>I'm an expert at this kind of thing.</i>

699
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:41,433
<i>Even when I started a business with Seok Kyeong, I was the one who secured all the investments.</i>

700
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:46,167
<i>I'd like to return the favor for the wedding gift… how about now?</i>

701
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,800
<i>What do you think</i>

702
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,967
<i>Kang Hee, would you like to comfortably talk about</i>

703
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:55,000
<i>the things you want to accomplish through work?</i>

704
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,267
<i>Someday,</i>

705
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:05,033
<i>I want to have my own company.</i>

706
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:10,433
<i>A company with my name on it.</i>

707
00:52:10,433 --> 00:52:11,867
<i>And?</i>

708
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,033
<i>Near the company,</i>

709
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:17,667
<i>I want to have my own space.</i>

710
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:21,533
<i>Not a goshiwon or a semi-basement… but a space of my own.</i>

711
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:23,733
<i>A space of my own.</i>

712
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,533
<i>- And?
- What more could I ask for?</i>

713
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:31,833
<i>If it comes to that… I might as well sell my soul to the devil.</i>

714
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:37,100
<i>Would you perhaps be willing to receive an investment?</i>

715
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,033
<i>Who would invest in me?</i>

716
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:41,333
<i>When receiving an investment,</i>

717
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:44,667
<i>do you know what the hardest part is?</i>

718
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:48,867
<i>Finding someone who recognizes my value.</i>

719
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:50,867
<i>Kang Hee, you've already met them.</i>

720
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,900
<i>CEO Hwang Jeong Goo has a good reputation in the industry.</i>

721
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:00,433
<i>Geum Seok Kyeong, I vouch for him. He has ample financial resources. Above all,</i>

722
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:03,500
<i>it's a company that would believe in our potential.</i>

723
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,133
<i>Ji Kang Hee and I, together, hand in hand.</i>

724
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:13,167
<i>Let's join forces and conquer the motel industry once and for all.</i>

725
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:24,900
You were behind all of that?

726
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,400
And you haven't said a word to me about it until now?

727
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,600
If you two are the Hwang-Geum line,

728
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,033
shall we say we're the Park-Ji line?

729
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:38,400
Let's split the dividends in half.

730
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,600
Now, having received the dividends, shall we get inspired to work?

731
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,133
What did you call me for?

732
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:49,933
Can you go as the site manager for our company's branding project?

733
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,967
Thank you!

734
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:56,200
I will really, really work hard.

735
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,800
Loyalty!

736
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:02,533
Where is the site?

737
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:06,067
You might not know it, it's called Hana-eup.

738
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:08,167
Where did you say?

739
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,900
Hana-eup.

740
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:22,733
- Just a little bit lower.
- Yes.

741
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:24,770
Okay, it seems like gastroenteritis.

742
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,930
The cause is often stress.

743
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:31,533
In the case of acute gastroenteritis, it could be due to eating something bad.

744
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,900
Director, a phone call.

745
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,833
Yes, sir.

746
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:41,400
Ah, is that so? Yes.

747
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,967
Yes, I will go right away.

748
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:45,400
Yes, please wait a moment.

749
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,667
- Ms. Yoon, I need to go to the birth of a calf.
- Yes.

750
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,800
You know the snacks we usually give animals.

751
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,667
Never share with this one from now on, okay?

752
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,133
Yes.

753
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:55,600
<i>[Hana Veterinary Clinic]</i>

754
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,900
Doctor, have a safe trip.

755
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,200
Will you stop avoiding me?

756
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,733
Avoiding? Since when did I do that?

757
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:10,033
I'll double the incentive if you go to Hana-eup.

758
00:55:10,033 --> 00:55:13,267
I'll just take the penalty instead.

759
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:16,967
Are you really going to be like this? Let's talk.

760
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:18,933
I have a date, I need to go now.

761
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:20,967
I'll have my phone off, so don't look for me.

762
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,667
You know I'm on monthly leave from tomorrow, right?

763
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,400
I'm going.

764
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,267
Why is that?

765
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,400
She said it's a date.

766
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:40,133
- A date?
- Yes.

767
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,967
Ah Reum.

768
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:00,400
Hey!

769
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:04,300
How did you get here?

770
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,600
I will, I'll carry it for you. Just a moment.

771
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,567
Hello! Wow, you have a lot of luggage.

772
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:17,533
It so happens I have a cart in my car.

773
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:19,567
Please, wait a moment.

774
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,833
- Who is it?
- A company employee.

775
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:28,300
- Did you follow me?
- No.

776
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,967
I live next door.

777
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:31,200
You live next door?

778
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,500
Because it's the company dormitory.

779
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,800
Hey, dormitory? At such an expensive place?

780
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,033
Our company has a lot of money.

781
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:41,067
Hey, what does your company actually do?

782
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:47,667
What?

783
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:56,233
Wow, it's so beautiful!

784
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:59,633
Hey, what is this?

785
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:03,800
Oh, my! Wow, goodness!

786
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,233
Ah Reum, look at that.

787
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:10,600
I designed this. It's in the magazine.

788
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,033
Really? Wow, that's cool!

789
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:17,267
Is this a company business card?

790
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,533
Hgpj?

791
00:57:19,533 --> 00:57:22,867
This J is for Ji Kang Hee's.

792
00:57:22,867 --> 00:57:25,400
Hwang-Geum-Park-Ji.

793
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,633
Hwang Jeong Goo, Geum Seok Kyeong, Park Esther, Ji Kang Hee.

794
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:32,467
Hey, so this is your company?

795
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:35,667
You could say I'm sort of a founding member.

796
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:38,033
I have a small stake in it, too.

797
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:40,367
Goodness!

798
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:44,400
Wow, I think I'm really going to cry!

799
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,067
Just a moment.

800
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,800
Have this with your friend.

801
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,033
If you need anything else, just let me know.

802
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:05,933
If your friend wants to tour Seoul, my car…

803
00:58:05,933 --> 00:58:07,900
We'll take good care of it.

804
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,300
- Just a second…
- Ah, thank you, take care.

805
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,267
- Aren't I going in?
- Ah, yes, yes.

806
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:16,067
- Your friend…
- Have a good day.

807
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,700
Hey, that guy likes you, right?

808
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,500
He likes me? Really?

809
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,420
Yeah.

810
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,400
I didn't know.

811
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:30,833
Hey!

812
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:35,333
Have you heard any rumors lately? About me.

813
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,633
What rumor?

814
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:39,400
Kim Heon Yeol didn't say anything?

815
00:58:40,033 --> 00:58:41,967
That can't be right.

816
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:44,700
Disappointed? Want me to spread a rumor?

817
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,033
A fabulous guy lives next door to Kang Hee?

818
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:50,700
The guy next door is dying for Kang Hee?

819
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,100
Go ahead, spread it.

820
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,867
All right.

821
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,800
I'm not going back to that neighborhood anyway,

822
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,533
whether the rumor spreads or not.

823
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,333
It's a relief.

824
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:05,833
You and Yeon Soo both met nice people.

825
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,600
Yeon Soo...

826
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,067
met someone?

827
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,067
That…

828
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:18,200
A junior from the same school.

829
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,833
Ah.

830
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,867
It's looking like he'll get married soon.

831
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,933
I see...

832
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:33,267
Ah, that's right! I brought this.

833
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:35,067
My mom's homemade fresh kimchi.

834
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:38,100
Mom really said she wouldn't make it, but…

835
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,667
But when I told her it was for you, she made it right away.

836
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:42,667
Anyone want kimchi?

837
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,733
Me!

838
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:50,900
First, the seasoning will be really delicious.

839
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,667
Fresh leafy mustard goes in… either sand lance sauce or anchovy sauce.

840
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,733
Senior!

841
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:58,600
Oh, Ms. Yoon.

842
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,033
Uh, do you drive?

843
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:08,967
No, it's been a while since I got my license… I need to take the driving course again.

844
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:11,067
Oh, is that so?

845
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,967
While I'm not here, you might need to travel alone,

846
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:15,400
and there might be a lot of emergencies.

847
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,167
Take some training when you have time.

848
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,267
Can't you give me the driving training?

849
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:27,600
It would work if you train me.

850
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:33,000
Sorry, I don't have a car.

851
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,867
Oh, why not?

852
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:38,000
Why don't you train me? Please do it.

853
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,460
Please do it.

854
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:42,500
I'll do it, later. Later, right?

855
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,933
Okay, you're doing well.

856
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,867
But shall we speed up a bit?

857
01:00:57,867 --> 01:00:59,400
- Speed?
- Yes.

858
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,467
- Just press it gently.
- Fast?

859
01:01:01,467 --> 01:01:03,600
Yes, just a little.

860
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,633
Oh, but I see a car over there.

861
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:10,433
- What should I do?
- Oh, it's okay.

862
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,600
- Now, stay calm, and…
- Yes.

863
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,900
Tap the brake lightly and… just move a little to the right.

864
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,300
- Yes.
- Yes, lightly.

865
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,267
Brake! Brake!

866
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:27,200
No, you have to press the brake! What are you doing?

867
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:30,733
Brake, not the accelerator!

868
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:32,267
Right, right! Brake.

869
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:34,700
Brake, to the right!

870
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,567
Are you okay? You're not hurt, right?

871
01:01:52,033 --> 01:01:55,600
The car is fine, so just stay put.

872
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,333
Don't get out.

873
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:05,867
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

874
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,700
Get in the passenger seat, I'll drive.

875
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:19,467
I can't get out, senior.

876
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:22,467
Okay.

877
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,667
Get out carefully.

878
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,333
Watch your step.

879
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,400
Be careful.

880
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:10,900
♫ <i>What if I was wrong apart from my everything</i> ♫

881
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:17,540
♫ <i>Don't force me to hurt because of my feelings for you</i> ♫
