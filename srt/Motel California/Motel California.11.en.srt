<i>Listening and obeying well?</i>

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>No.</i>

4
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,267

8
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,200
<i>That's not it either.</i>

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,733
<i>Then what is it?</i>

10
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,767
<i>Love is</i>

11
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,567
<i>being by each other's side.</i>

12
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,133
<i>Like this?</i>

13

<i>Yeah, and</i>

15
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,467

<i>I said I hate it, ask to change it for me.</i>

00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>What's wrong with being number 3?</i>

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,600
<i>Why am I number 3?</i>

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,033
<i>We won the stick-hopping game because of me.</i>

23
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>I'm stronger than Han Woo and Seung Eon.</i>

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,833
<i>Gosh, dumb bear!</i>

25
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>We are a family, the Kang Hee family.
Do you think the numbers are random?</i>

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,900
<i>Seung Eon has been with us
since he was 7, so he is number 1.</i>

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,833
<i>Han Woo has been playing with us
since he was 8, so he is number 2.</i>

28
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,467
<i>And you moved here when you were 9.</i>

29
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:45,333
<i>Then, what do I have to do to become number 1?</i>

30
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:49,233
<i>I really want to be your number 1.</i>

31
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,667
<i>Well? I don't know.</i>

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,433
<i>Hey!</i>

33
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,267
The words "I love you"

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,900
are said when people are leaving.

35
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeon Soo,

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,600
what I am trying to say…

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,633
Don't do it.

38
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,333
Don't do it, please!

39
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,167
I love you.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,200
I love you, Yeon Soo.

41
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,533
You said love is about hugging

42
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,933
and holding hands.

43
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:08,167
We knew that when we were 10.
Why don't we know that now?

44
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,867
Don't do this, Yeon Soo.

45
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,567
We can't go back to before the accident.

46
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:19,333
No, it doesn't matter.

47
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:22,433
Can't we just think about the two of us?

48
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:25,833
If you say it doesn't matter,
will my sin disappear?

49
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:30,033
If you say you love me,
if you hug me and hold my hand,

50
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,900
will what happened disappear?

51
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,267
Will my dead mother, your
dead father come back to life?

52
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:42,167
Don't make it more painful, Yeon Soo.

53
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:49,700
Fine, do as you like.

54
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,667
But just know this,

55
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,633
no matter how much you try to avoid and hide,

56
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,633
nothing will change.

57
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,267
You will come back again,

00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,133
because I'll be right here.

59
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,267

I took care of the registration in advance,

since we're hospital mates.

67
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,067
See, I told you I could come alone.

- Goodbye.

- Yes.

Stay here, it's alright.

Yes, I'm the son.

In the name of the Father, and of

God illuminates our hearts.

Firmly believing in God's mercy,

87
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:42,700
confess truthfully the sins you have committed.

88
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:50,300
My heart is stronger than that of most priests.

89
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,900
I'll listen to any confession

90
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,567
and keep your secrets.

91

Does God

92

forgive any sin if it's confessed?

93
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,033
Does He forgive anything?

94
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,867
Of course.

95
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,967
I killed someone.

96
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,800
I killed my mom and Yeon Soo's dad,

97
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,367
and then I forgot about it

98
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,467
for 20 years.

99
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Then I dared to love Yeon Soo.

100
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,633
Can I be forgiven too?

101
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,233
Can He forgive someone like me?

102
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,600
Do you know how to turn yourself in?

103
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,233
I did some research.

104
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,400
This is all that comes up?

105
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:22,600
- Open it.
- How are you planning to turn yourself in?

106
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,700
Do you have any evidence?

107
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,567
The doll that you supposedly
shoved in, it's gone now, right?

108
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,733
What about the car? It has already
been scrapped, and it's gone, right?

109
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,867
How old were you back then?

110
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,567
You were young.

111
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,100
You found that memory after 20 years,

112
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,700
how can you be sure it's true or not?

113
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,300
You just

114
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,833
want to punish yourself.

115
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:53,933
You didn't even talk to Yeon Soo,
you just cut ties and ran away, right?

116
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,567
Shouldn't Yeon Soo be the one
giving the punishment, if there is any?

117
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,600
Whether you apologize or get punished,

118
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:04,667

Chun Pil was diagnosed

He had 12 rounds of chemotherapy back then.

123
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,333
I had no idea, not at all.

124
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,067

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>The hospital life alone

<i>Meeting Mr. Tarzan has been a great help.</i>

131
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,767
<i>I also matched outfits

139
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,367
I thought he was just saying that back then,

140
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,400
but it seemed he was serious.

141
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,528
He said he won't receive any more treatment.

142
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,200
I can't persuade him.

143
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,000
So, Mr. Yeon Soo, please try to talk to him.

144
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,867
Where is he now?

The night view is really beautiful.

00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:34,733

Yeon Soo,

149
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,700
merry Christmas.

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,233
Oh, merry Christmas in advance.

00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,233
Merry Christmas in advance, sir.

152
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,100
Enough.

153
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,733
I've made up my mind, Yeon Soo.

154
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:53,733
About what?

155
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,133
I need to change my car.

156
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,667
- I'm going to change it to a camper.
- All of a sudden?

157
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:05,200
Driving around wherever my feet
take me, to places with no name

158
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,633
and suddenly disappear without a trace.

159
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:12,300
Then to prevent that, I must follow you around.

160
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,933
But there's just one thing that bothers me.

161
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,767
I'm worried about Kang Hee and Seung Eon.

162
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:28,467
Well, you said you'd take
responsibility for Kang Hee.

163
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,267
What about me?

164
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,100
To me, you are like a father.

165
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,433
Why exclude me?

166
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,500
You're not worried about me?

167
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,433
Sir,

168
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,100
can you please do the chemotherapy?

169
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,333
Or at least,

170
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,967
just get admitted.

171
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,267
Hospital gowns don't suit me.

172
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,467
What doesn't suit you?

173
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:05,233
If you walk down the hospital corridor
wearing a hospital gown, it's like a runway.

174
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:10,167
That's because you're my fan.

175
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,967
It's not because I'm your fan,
it's because I'm your son.

176
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:22,367
Do you know how many memories
you and I have together?

177
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,933
I once told you that you
looked cool playing the guitar.

178
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,933
Then you taught me how to play the guitar.

179
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,333
Because I was chubby,

180
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:47,533
when I told you that my friends
wouldn't play sports with me,

181
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,033
you played soccer and basketball with me.

182
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,933
You talk too much, brat.

183
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,072
Until you say you'll get treated,

184
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:05,400
just know that I won't give up on you.

185
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,300
Chemotherapy makes all your hair fall out.

186
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:24,600
I spent so much effort regrowing my hair.

187
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,467
Let's not tell Kang Hee.

188
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:39,033
I haven't done much for her until now.

189
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,567
Finally,

190
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,933
she's able to smile and go about her life.

191
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,300
I don't want to make it hard for her.

192
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,333
<i>Kang Hee is not living happily.</i>

193
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,600
<i>She is struggling right now.</i>

194
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,033
<i>So you have to hold on, sir.</i>

195
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,133
<i>Please.</i>

196
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,200
Instead of Kang Hee,

197
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,767
I'll take care of you.

198
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:17,233
I don't want you to struggle, either.

199
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,000
It's not hard for me.

200
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:18,033
<i>No matter how much you try to avoid or hide,</i>

201
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:20,367

204
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,067
I'm sorry, Yeon Soo.

205
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm sorry.

<i>[Motel California]</i>

207
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,567
Good morning.

208
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,500
Where is Yeon Soo?

209
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,500
Probably went out?

210
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,967
Did he come in

211
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,600
last night?

212
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,100
Probably?

213
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,867
Mr. Kwon, you're neglecting your duties.

214
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,433
No way…

215
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,100
Kang Hee.

216
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Where's Yeon Soo?

217
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,033
Weren't you staying together in Seoul?

218
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,367
He said he had to go somewhere
for a few days due to work.

219
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,133
I think it's probably that

220
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,833
he's going for interviews.

221
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,833
What interviews?

222
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,500
He's been searching for
veterinary researcher jobs.

223
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,233
I thought he talked this over with you.

It's me, Nan Woo.

230
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,900
It seems she's not here.

231
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:40,433
I can't face Han Woo anymore.

232
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:45,433
I shouldn't have interfered
when you told me not to.

233
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,700
I'm embarrassed.

234
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:53,567
Why? Didn't Han Woo thank you that day?

235
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,833
- Really?
- I would be grateful too.

236
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,067
You worried about me, ran to me, and caught me.

237
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:08,100
I'm glad you think that way.

238
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,733
Have you sorted all

00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,800
your feelings for Yeon Soo?

240
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,433
Why should I sort them out?

241
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,400
I can't sort them out.

242
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,733
To me, the director

243
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:33,800
is like… an idol star?

244
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,000
He was, he is, and will always be

00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:42,167
Yes.

247
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,733
Then, what about Han Woo?

248
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,667
Do you like Han Woo?

249
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,467
Then…

250
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,467
That's not right, is it?

251
00:25:58,467 --> 00:25:59,667
Why not?

252
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,333
Is it okay?

253
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,767
I don't know.

254
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:07,633
Now's not the time for me
to advise others on their love life.

255
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,467
I have my own problems to deal with.

256

Uh, what's this? Who is it?

257
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,333
I always tell you everything.

258
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,300
I promise I won't tell the Yeon Soo.

259
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,733
I won't tell even to Han Woo, okay?

260
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:21,200
Hey, you like Ms. Yoon, right?

261
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,444
What?

262
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
It's obvious.

263
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,000
What's obvious? No, it's not like that.

264
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,533

Hey, Han Ah Reum.

267
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,900

I've made up my mind.

00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:06,367
Now it's your turn. There's
something you need to do.

273
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:11,265
What my mom said about

274
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:13,099
you being an uneducated orphan,

275
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,733
I apologize for that.

276
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,600
Sorry.

277
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,933
But even if you can't help with other things,

278
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,467
you can avoid this with
a middle school diploma.

279
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,367
You know I have a teaching certificate, right?

280
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:34,100
I'll help you prepare for the GED.

281
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,033

282
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:46,533

when you're available to talk?</i>

286
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,033

You can go now, Mr. Yeon Soo.

295
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,500

00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,700
Go back, don't worry.

Haven't you heard anything from Yeon Soo yet?

302
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,133
Oh? Manager.

303
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:41,400
The veterinarian came.

304
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:00,400

00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:28,867
why haven't you contacted me?

308
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,633
<i>Let's not tell Kang Hee.</i>

309
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:35,933
<i>I don't want to make it hard for her.</i>

310
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:38,167
I came because I had something to say.

311
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,633
I have a lot of work delayed.

312
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:50,100

313
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,633
Why are you back so soon?

314
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,967
You probably find it uncomfortable to see me.

315
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,000
I was a coward.

316
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,300
I wanted to believe Yeon Soo's
words that it didn't matter.

317
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,967
Listening your advice to overcome
it alongside Yeon Soo,

318
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,667
I wanted to be deceived.

319
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:34,133
You said Esther is going to the US soon?

320
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,567
Does it taste good when you eat alone?

321
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,000
I ordered something that tastes
good even when eaten alone.

322
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,367
Is this sauce the secret?

323
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,167
It's addictive.

324
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,900
More than Kang Hee?

325
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,200
Kang Hee is going overseas
to study with Esther.

326
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,467
I think that's a good idea
too, and I plan to help.

327
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,367
Where are you going?

328
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,667
I need to stop them.

329
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:38,033
Do you think someone like her
will feel better running away abroad?

330
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:43,000
You can't let her live her entire life
with guilt, criticizing herself.

331
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm going to tell her not to run
away, to face it by my side.

332
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,467
As much as Kang Hee is
struggling, no, even more so,

333
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,500
I am ready to bear it with
her, and endure it all.

334
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:21,233
Study abroad?

335
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,367
All of a sudden?

336
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,233
Don't even dream about it.

Hey, no, go back.

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,200
If you want to register your marriage, you need
to go to the town office. Why come to me?

340
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,100
Actually, if I want to see a traffic accident
investigation records, what should I do?

341
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Traffic accident?

342
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,900
What? What kind? Which one?

343
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,033
You know, our parents'
traffic accident long ago.

344
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,900
I want to know the exact
details of the accident.

345
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,567
I have the right to know.

346
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:07,133
Yes, of course you do.

347
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,100
Hold on a second.

348
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,967
First, you need to file a viewing request.

349
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:16,467
You can't do it right now, you need to
fill out the application. Should I help?

350
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,200
Yes.

351
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,867
Wait a moment.

352
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,633
Kang Hee,

353
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,100
I can't leave you alone in vague guilt.

354
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:50,233
If my father really ended up
like that because of you,

355
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:55,067
you should take care of me
in place of my father.

356
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:58,133
You should hold me and cheer me up.

357
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,267
Where were you trying to run away to?

358
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,933
Nothing is certain yet.

359
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,733
No matter what the conclusion is,
stay by my side.

360
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:19,633
Hold my hand and let's overcome it together.

361
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:27,400
You're cold, right?

362
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,533
Are you okay?

363
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,200
Sure, I'm okay.

364
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,067
Just a moment.

365
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,767
<i>[Seoul Blue General Hospital Registration]</i>

366
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,433
Was this why you couldn't be reached?

367
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,767
Why is this still here?

368
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,667
Be honest with me.

369
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,467
Well, it's like…

370
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,267
Are you hurt?

371
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:38,967
Were you hospitalized?
Is it a terminal illness?

372
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,300
Not me, but someone else.

373
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,000
Someone else, who?

374
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,967
Well… I went to a conference in Seoul.

375
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:50,133
A friend was kicked
by a horse and broke his ribs.

376
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,933
But I broke some of
my own ribs back in the day.

377
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:56,967
So I gave him advice and just
took care of him, as I was there…

378
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,833
You…

379
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,867
You're really a terrible liar.

380
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,067
It's not a lie.

381
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,033
I said I'm okay.

382
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,133
Being a large animal vet is a dangerous job.

383
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,533
You be careful too.

384
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:14,967
Don't worry.

385
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,100
I'm the top-ranked among the cows in this town.

386
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,567
Were you thinking of getting a job
elsewhere because you're number one?

387
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:25,067
I know you went for an
interview, not a conference.

388
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,400
Oh.

389
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,967
We hid it from each other to avoid worrying.

390
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:32,967
Pushing each other away,
thinking it's for the other's sake.

391
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,967
Let's avoid that.

392
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,067
Okay?

393
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:41,767
Okay.

394
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,900
Promise?

395
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,400
Promise.

396
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,600
Director.

397
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,933
Why did you come out? I told you to rest.

398
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:18,200
You said you don't like the hotel breakfast,
and have plans for dinner, so I had to come.

399
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,833
I was a bit busy.

400
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,300
Are you dating?

401
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,167
Ah, well… it's similar.

402
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,200
Well, please find a replacement for me.

403
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:30,900
Have you made up your mind?

404
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,933
I'm trying to make a new start.

405
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:35,133
I don't want to be under
my parents' interference here.

406
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,800
I hate hearing this and that even more.

407
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,600
Anyway,

408
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,200
I think I need to go to the US.

409
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,500
No way.

410
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,933
Walk carefully, it's dangerous.

411
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,533
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

412
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:02,167
Going abroad? Are you sure
you won't think about Little Heart?

413
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,833
Can you live as if you forgot
everything and nothing happened?

414
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:07,433
While you're missing Little Heart,

415
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:09,100
I don't want you to live a life full of regret.

416
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,400
Then what should I do?

417
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,433
Should I raise a fatherless child in Korea?

418
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,433
We can make it happen.

419
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,300
Esther,

420
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,933
look at yourself properly.

421
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,833
With your beauty, intelligence, and wealth,

422
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:25,167
overflowing with charm,
can't you find a father for the baby?

423
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,367
The only thing you're lacking
is a good eye for men.

424
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,967
I'll help you with that,
let's find a father together.

425
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:33,467
What are you talking about?

426
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,900
Hey, are you really crazy?

427
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,000
You should make a new start,

428
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,233
but do it with Little Heart.

429
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:42,500
It's Victor, that rat, who did wrong.
Why are you giving up on Little Heart?

430
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,233
You haven't done anything wrong.

431
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,567
Be confident, like Esther.

432
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:49,867
Find a man who will accept you as you are.

433
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,367
Will there be one?

434
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,433
There will be a line.

435
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,067
Trust me.

436
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,500
If you look inside, it has detailed
information about the accident.

437
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,467
If there's something you don't know,
don't hesitate to ask me.

438
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,833
Thank you, Min Goo.

439
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,867
For what? Take care of Kang Hee.

440
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:19,367
I'm leaving.

Four cars that slipped on icy roads.

446

It was a fatal accident
caused by a chain collision.

Really?

451
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,100
He is tall and handsome.

452
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,633
That's really something.

453
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,033
I hope he comes soon.

454
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,967
Oh? Yeon Soo.

455
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,600
Oh my God!

This is a family meeting place,
why are you here?

457
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:43,600
Kang Hee is my family now.

458
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,633
I won't let go of her hand.

459
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:49,567
Do you really have to make
me look like a bad person?

460
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,900
Just don't act like the bad person, Su Ji.

461
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,567
Just stay quiet for a moment.

462
00:42:55,567 --> 00:42:58,300
You know I clearly don't like her.

463
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,333
Holding hands? What are you thinking?

464
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,067
I'm sorry.

465
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:09,733
I have something important to say.

466
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,867
I'll say it and leave.

467
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:14,067
Let go of Yeon Soo's hand and talk.

468
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:15,500
I'll just…

469
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,467
Su Ji!

470
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,867
You really shouldn't be doing this.

471
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,267
Su Ji.

472
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:27,867
What's with that face?

473
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:32,000
A flower being angry and frowning?

474
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,700
A flower should smile brightly.

475
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,867
That's a right and a responsibility.

476
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,933
So a flower can't be angry?

477
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,867
If there's something to be angry
about, I'll be angry myself.

478
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:48,500
So, solve it through talking

479
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,533
and soften your face.

480
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:55,333
Through conversation, gently.

481
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,767
Okay.

482
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:01,467
Let's resolve everything here.

483
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:04,700
Yes, go ahead.

484
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:11,433
I was really struggling,

485
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:14,246
you know?

486
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,058
Your dad died suddenly in an accident,

487
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:20,724
people were gossiping so much.

488
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:24,128
Besides the accident your dad had,

489
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:28,233
he was cheating, deceiving me.

490
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,367
Let's leave that out.

491
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:36,600
It was so tough, I thought of just dying.

492
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,633
- What?
- Oh my!

493
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:40,633
Since I was going to die,

494
00:44:40,633 --> 00:44:43,033
like "Thelma & Louise".

495
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:45,412
You know, "Thelma & Louise"?

496
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:46,600
I know.

497
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,333
Let's hit it hard.

498
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:53,233
Let's go to the cliff and end it in style.

499
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:58,927
Didn't even make it to the cliff, the car
broke down in the middle of nowhere.

500
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,300
Thank goodness! It was heaven's help, Su Ji.

501
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,433
Just listen.

502
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:10,033
Kang Hee, you! It was because of you!

503
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:13,577
Kang Hee, your teddy bear!

504
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:18,682
It was blocking the exhaust pipe.

505
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:25,067
No wonder I felt nauseous, and
I almost threw up while driving.

506
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,600
Mom.

507
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,733
Is what you just said true?

508
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:32,767
It's the truth!

509
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,903
How could a child do that?

510
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:37,425
Kang Hee, you…

511
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:40,233
Just because I talked badly about your mom,

512
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,876
is that how you take revenge? On an adult?

513
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:46,567
I'm still too scared to drive.

514
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:49,933
Oh, my! Gods! Thank you!

515
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,433
You saved Su Ji's life.

516
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:56,733
It's all thanks to you that I met Su Ji today.

517
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:58,967
What? What is…

518
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:05,700
I'm sorry, ma'am.

519
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,733
I was wrong.

520
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,600
Please forgive me.

521
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,567
You were young, why go this far…

522
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,367
Thank you so much, Mom.

523
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:22,833
- Thank you.
- No.

524
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,733
What's going on?

525
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:34,133
Cheon Yeon Soo.

526
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:39,967
So, do I have your permission?

527
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:45,867
Be happy, Mom.

528
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,667
Don't cry.

529
00:46:58,667 --> 00:46:59,867
It makes you ugly.

530
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:04,000
Smile brightly like a flower.

531
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,933
That's right, just like that.

532
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,500
Give me this.

533
00:47:18,633 --> 00:47:20,733
Go spend some time alone.

534
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:29,933
I'm sorry.

535
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,233
I'm sorry for being born by mistake.

536
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,367
For thinking that I ruined everything.

537
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:42,867
I'm sorry for not loving you.

538
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,133
<i>It's okay now, right?</i>

539
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:52,833
Yes, it's okay.

540
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,400
I love you.

541
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,967
Jeez!

542
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,733
Why are you crying?

543
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,500
Hey! Oh, dear!

544
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,167
Oh, my. Look how heavy this is.

545
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,167
No, I didn't raise cows to make money.

546
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:32,033
I made money to raise cows, Dad.

547
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:35,133
Hey, is Chil Ddaeng your child?

548
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:36,400
Is it a pet?

549
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,633
You should raise and sell cows.

550
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:41,700
Jeez!

551
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,467
Gods, that's a lot!

552
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:45,533
Hey, let's eat. Let's eat.

553
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:50,967
I thought all that organic and
animal welfare stuff was nonsense.

554
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:53,867
I'll count on you in the future too, Han Woo.

555
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:56,467
You should eat all by yourself.

556
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,167
Jeez!

557
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:02,767
So, don't get too attached
to the cows from now on.

558
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,033
I miss you.

559
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:13,000
Chil Ddaeng!

560
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,600
Sampa Gwangtteng!

561
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,400
Pinggu!

562
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,567
Kkomak!

563
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:27,433
I regret raising cattle.

564
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:32,033
I had no idea it would be this hard.

565
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,300
Ms. Yoon.

566
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,100
You miss her a lot, don't you?

567
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:49,500
When, no…

568
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,300
From where did you hear it? No…

569
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,833
Did you hear us?

570
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,800
Earlier, I…

571
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,667
I heard it from the restaurant.

572
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:03,667
Just like you,

573
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,100
I miss Chil Ddaeng.

574
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,967
I understand how you feel.

575
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:15,000
I also pondered with the same feeling.

576
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,233
That's right.

577
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:22,933
Even lab dogs have their fate predetermined.

578
00:51:24,067 --> 00:51:28,267
Whenever that happens, Director always says,

579
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,433
even if they are destined to die tomorrow,

580
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:37,633
we should make sure
they live comfortably today.

581
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,067
While at your farm,

582
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:45,267
Chil Ddaeng was surely happy.

583
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,500
Thank you, Ms. Nan Woo.

584
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,400
That's really comforting.

585
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,400
Well, then, will you buy me food?

586
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,900
Yes.

587
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:07,700
I left my meal and even
my friend to follow you.

588
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,267
Oh, of course, I should treat you. Let's go.

589
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,800
Yes.

590
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:15,700
Is there anything specific you'd like to eat?

591
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,167
Um, anything but beef.

592
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:20,967
Oh, anything but beef?

593
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:23,200
Um, then…

594
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,700
Mr. Chun Pil is here.

595
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:35,967
You should rest, it's late.

596
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,500
I have something to say to Mr. Chun Pil.

597
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:07,133
Mr. Chun Pil, you're here.

598
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,933
Hey, there.

599
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,833
I have a favor to ask.

600
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:20,233
Thank you for asking.

601
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,967
I'd really like you to listen.

602
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:27,400
Yeah.

603
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:30,233
Please,

604
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:32,733
adopt Seung Eon.

605
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,267
Seung Eon is my brother.

606
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:39,467
He's not an orphan.

607
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,500
Thank you for saying that.

608
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:48,200
It's something I've always
kept to myself as well.

609
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,633
I found it

610
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:56,667
hard to say to you.

611
00:53:57,967 --> 00:54:00,167
It's not a difficult favor, right?

612
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,900
You just need to go
to the town office and apply.

613
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,533
It's that simple?

614
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,000
It's not like you're changing
his surname or anything.

615
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,500
Just register with the family department.

616
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,533
If it's that easy, we should
have done it earlier.

617
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,333
I feel sorry.

618
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:21,833
I'm feeling sleepy because
I took some medicine.

619
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,800
But I still need to say this.

620
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:28,800
If I die,

621
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,300
you'll have to split the inheritance
with Seung Eon, is that okay?

622
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,400
That won't do.

623
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:39,767
You should spend all your money and then die.

624
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:42,933
So live a long, long life.

625
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,500
I got it.

626
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,700
Are you leaving?

627
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,067
The floor is hard.

628
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,600
What is this?

629
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,900
It's medicine, what else?

630
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,967
What kind of medicine?

631
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:10,833
When you get older, everything starts to hurt.

632
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:15,700
I got them all at once because it's a hassle.

633
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,700
Yeon Soo, come out.

634
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,800
Uh?

635
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:51,167
Have you ever heard that Mr. Chun Pil is sick?

636
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,167
No, I haven't heard anything.

637
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,567
Well, in his room

638
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:00,033
there are bags full of medicine.

639
00:56:00,033 --> 00:56:01,633
It's like one's daily bread.

640
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:03,333
Really?

641
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,467
It's not a fatal illness, right?

642
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,233
Mr. Chun Pil?

643
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:15,967
Go in and rest quickly.

644
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,600

Yeah, it's been a while.

655
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:21,000
I saw your father come, with Yeon Soo.

Do you know why?

657

01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,833
Because gods can't die.

719
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:10,533
That's why death is alluring.

720
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,000
Are you dying?

721
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,467
No, it's just that… Hey, won't you die?

722
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:20,467
Jeez!

723
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:23,033
No, everyone dies eventually.

724
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:26,500
Life has meaning because of death, right?

725
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,433
It's alluring, even romantic, exactly.

726
01:02:30,933 --> 01:02:33,500
Romantic Mr. Chun Pil,

727
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,300
what's the diagnosis?

728
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,767
Cancer.

729
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:17,200
Kang Hee.

730
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,600
Kang Hee, I'll explain everything.

731
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,533
- Wait, let me talk…
- Don't say a word.

732
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,400
You knew everything.

733
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,333
What Chun Pil's illness is
and what that medicine is.

734
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:27,567
You both went to the hospital together, right?

735
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,900
That receipt was Chun Pil's, wasn't it?

736
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,133
You kept it from me and checked
out a nursing home together?

737
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:36,600
What on earth were you two thinking?

738
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,433
Am I really nothing? Not even a daughter?

739
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,733
Don't follow me.

740
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:48,400
Just keep taking care of him
as you've been doing.

741
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,733
Get out.

742
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,467
You won't get out?

743
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:39,533
