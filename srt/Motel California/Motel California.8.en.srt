1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,833
Yeon Soo,

2
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:26,067
is it okay for friends to kiss?

3
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,267
Why would you kiss among friends?

4
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:09,867
You're crossing the line.

5
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,033
You're really a friend.

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,533
My friend,

7
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,500
thanks for the gift.

8
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,100
Let's just have a drink.

9
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,467
- Alcohol?
- We have to drink for the housewarming.

10
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,167
You can't drink alcohol?

11
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,567
What do you take me for?

12
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,100
Whether you look at my height or my build,

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,600
whoever I drink with, I've never lost.

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,167
That's great.

15
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,933
Let's give it a go today.

16
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,933
Let's go all the way.

17
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,233
- Deal!
- Deal!

18
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,233
Rock, paper, scissors!

19
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,033
Rock, paper, scissors! Paper!

20
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:46,900
Set it up.

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,733
<i>[Assistant Manager Ji Kang Hee]</i>

22
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,567
- Yeah, why?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Where else would I be?
At the convenience store.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Good timing, there's something
you need to buy on the way.

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,633
<i>What is it?</i>

26
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:04,400
Never mind. I'll buy it when you
come later. Without this at night…

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,467
- I bought it.
<i>- You did?</i>

28
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,700
<i>Well, it is your house, after all.</i>

29
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:17,000
We're on the same page, after all.

30
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,133
Is it here?

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,200
- What is?
- What?

32
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,400
Where's the lightbulb?

33
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,000
- The lightbulb?
- The one over there has burned out.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Weren't you supposed to buy that?

35
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,867
What do you mean? How are
we on the same page, exactly?

36
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,067
Instant noodles!

37
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,800
You like instant noodles, don't you?

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
I thought we should eat it
if we get hungry later.

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,933
With just this one?

40
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:50,600
It's okay. I'll buy it in a moment.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,933
Ah, it's fine. We can change
the lightbulb later.

42
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,967
I'll be quick, have it set up.

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
If it's the lightbulb, say so.
Don't make it so confusing.

44
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,467
Ah, that clueless teddy bear…

45
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,833
That's enough, is there
anything else to help with?

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,833
Huh?

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,933
No.

48
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,933
That's right, Kang Hee.

49
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,733
Reminiscing about the old
days, I bought this too.

50
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,000
Ah, don't do it!

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why? You did this to me too.

52
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,333
Are you taking revenge on me now?

53
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,167
Are you going to do everything I did?

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,233
Should I?

55
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,667
That's childish.

56
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,000
Ah, it's so cozy.

57
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,767
Come here.

58
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,433
What for?

59
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:36,600
Hurry up!

60
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,633
I'm here.

61
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,500
Kang Hee.

62
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,067
Will you sleep with me?

63
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,733
<i>Come here.</i>

64
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,933
<i>Yeon Soo.</i>

65
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,967
<i>Will you sleep with me?</i>

66
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:03,733
Hey!

67
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,033
Why are you so surprised? It was just a joke.

68
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,333
Wow! Cheon Yeon Soo!

69
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,933
Are you really Cheon Yeon Soo?

70
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,067
- Of course, it's me.
- Doesn't seem like it?

71
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,767
Seems like we need to check?

72
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,533
Ah! What are you saying? It hurts.

73
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,700
Don't do it, don't! Hey!

74
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,800
You're not Cheon Yeon Soo, are you?

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,933
Oh, using force? You'll get in trouble!
Let's see who's stronger!

76
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,167
Ah! It hurts! It hurts!

77
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:29,400
Ah, don't do it!

78
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,500
<i>Yeon Soo.</i>

79
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,967
<i>Will you sleep with me?</i>

80
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,400
Does it hurt?

81
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,267
Let's not overdo it.

82
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,333
We're friends.

83
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:18,200
Friends.

84
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,967
You were spying on me
when I was changing the light bulb.

85
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,600
No, I wasn't.

86
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
I stared openly, you know?

87
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,400
You're bold, Ji Kang Hee.

88
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,767
That's what a supervisor does.

89
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,833
Checking if the bulb works well or not.

90
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,367
Professional consciousness. Professional.

91
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,033
Right, if you need to change the bulb
in the future, just call me.

92
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,933
If I call, will you come?

93
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,667
Of course!

94
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,867
If not me, some other guy
will come and change it.

95
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,600
So what?

96
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:11,433
Hey, you think I came to change the bulb
and ended up drinking like this? What?

97
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,967
For the past ten years, we lived
without caring for each other.

98
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,400
Why the sudden nosiness now?

99
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,467
Who says we lived without caring?

100
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,133
What?

101
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,633
You must have done that.

102
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,533
I…

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,067
My daily routine is

104
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:45,233
hoping Ji Kang Hee is happy
when I wake up in the morning.

105
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,400
Even when I come home
exhausted after all night,

106
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,533
I pray and hope that Ji Kang Hee was happy.

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,533
I manage to live well on my own.

108
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:03,867
To that extent…

109
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,600
What about you?

110
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,167
Didn't you think of me?

111
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,933
I was your first man.

112
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,133
Hey, you're drunk.

113
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm not drunk, okay?

114
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,133
You're drunk.

115
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,667
Ugh, fine!

116
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,933
I'm drunk! I'm drunk!

117
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,700
Ji Kang Hee must be happy.

118
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,267
Strong with drinks and many men.

119
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,033
How many men from Seoul have you met?

120
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,300
Why count them?

121
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,167
Wow! Looks like you've met too many to count.

122
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,833
Ah? What are you saying?

123
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,533
Hey, stop drinking.

124
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,033
I'll get some cold water.

125
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,433
Have I changed, for real?

126
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,700
You have changed.

127
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,367
How and where have I changed?

128
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,967
Was the old me better?

129
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,333
Should I gain weight again?

130
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,167
In the past,

131
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,433
here,

132
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,067
and here,

133
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,300
here too.

134
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,767
Everything was all soft and fluffy.

135
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,133
No matter how sharp I was,

136
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,967
you took it all in.

137
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,700
Wait a minute, I need to use the bathroom.

138
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,067
Come out quickly, Ji Kang Hee.

139
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,733
I want to see you soon.

140
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,667
Yeon Soo.

141
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
What are you doing?

142
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeon Soo?

143
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,033
Are you really sleeping?

144
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,600
Wake up!

145
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,500
So annoying!

146
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,167
Are you awake?

147
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,800
You're sleeping well.

148
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,900
How can you fall asleep? Huh?

149
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,567
Ugh!

150
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,400
Ugh, seriously. Just stay still.

151
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,633
Wow, what a cool pose.

152
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,833
I hope you had a happy day today.

153
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,667
Good night, Kang Hee.

154
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,067
Wake up.

155
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,900
<i>Did you sleep well?</i>

156
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,167
It's a dream.

157
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,867
Kang Hee is smiling.

158
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,133
<i>It's not a dream, you know?</i>

159
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,700
I don't want to wake up.

160
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,400
I can even hear her voice.

161
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,067
Wake up while I ask nicely.

162
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,733
Get up! Get up!

163
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:25,300
What is it?

164
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,633
What time is it? What is it?

165
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,633
Hey, was I asleep? You should've woken me up!

166
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,000
Wake you up? What for?

167
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Considering you can't hold your liquor,

168
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,533
don't go around drinking alcohol anywhere.

169
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,967
Are you mad because I was sleeping?

170
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,667
Why would I be mad?

171
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,900
That alcohol is strong, so I bought a lot. My
stomach hurts from drinking it all by myself.

172
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,867
Hurry up and get up. Let's
go have some hangover soup.

173
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:50,867
Ok.

174
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,900
Just a moment.

175
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,500
Ah, I'm crazy. I should have held back.

176
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,067
Ah! I couldn't hold back from that?

177
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,133
Ah, my head.

178
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,000
Why are you coming out from there?

179
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,900
Why are you coming out from over
there, Mr. Geum Seok Kyeong?

180
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,733
Were the two of you together?

181
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,800
Were you the next-door neighbor?

182
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
It's a dormitory, so we live next door.

183
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,767
We're old school friends from the same
town. I could let him stay for a night.

184
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,033
I asked first… Why are you
answering Mr. Yeon Soo first?

185
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,367
Wow! That's really childish, right?

186
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,267
There was no such talk
at the company yesterday.

187
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,467
You said you were going straight to Hana-eup.

188
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:56,033
Didn't I say I'd be waiting
in front of the company?

189
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,500
Stop it.

190
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,333
Let's stop.

191
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,033
Don't tell me you two

192
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,233
sleep together?

193
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,767
Yes, we slept.

194
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,700
What else would you do at night if not sleep?

195
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,867
And Mr. Geum Seok Kyeong, didn't you sleep?

196
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:15,967
Ah, yes, I slept too.

197
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,400
Stop joking, Cheon Yeon Soo.

198
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,867
Nothing happened between the two of you, right?

199
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,167
What would happen between friends…

200
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,900
You're hesitant.

201
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,400
If I finish this, should I get up first?

202
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,667
Ah, I really want to say it, but I can't.

203
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,533
Because Little Heart might hear.

204
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,967
Shouldn't you only hear good
things during prenatal care?

205
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,167
Little Heart is cool like me.

206
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,933
He'll automatically pick out
what he wants to hear.

207
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,433
What is it?

208
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,300
Count to three.

209
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,067
One, two…

210
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,233
I…

211
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:07,867
Am jealous.

212
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:08,867
What?

213
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,767
Ms. Kang Hee, definitely said
she was going to Hana-eup yesterday.

214
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,000
This morning,

215
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,600
she came out of the house with a man.

216
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
A man? Who's the man?

217
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Cheon Yeon Soo.

218
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,500
That's it, so what?

219
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,767
That's why.

220
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,300
We also slept together at the condo
several times when we went to IR.

221
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,867
I mean yes, but…

222
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,267
I asked if they slept together.

223
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,767
Really?

224
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,300
Did you really ask that?

225
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah. Why did I do that?

226
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
You must have been very anxious, Seok Kyeong.

227
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,067
Indeed, Cheon Yeon Soo is really cool.

228
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:54,200
He's tall, good-looking, and manly.

229
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,500
Cool? Who?

230
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,633
No, I mean, after all, it's just a first love.

231
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,700
A common first love that everyone has.

232
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,767
So,

233
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,933
why can't you go to her,
despite being so confident?

234
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,533
I'll go. I said I will,

235
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,200
after drinking this.

236
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,067
Does that man matter?

237
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,433
Why make excuses?

238
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,933
Whatever that man is, why do you care?

239
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,033
Even if you're friends, touching
on that topic is a bit much.

240
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,233
There was nothing. We said nothing happened.

241
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,267
How is that an excuse?

242
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,467
Hey, about yesterday…

243
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,900
I've been unable to sleep well every dawn
due to the difficult deliveries of the cows.

244
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,133
I couldn't sleep for two days again this time.

245
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,100
That's why I didn't drive
and came by bus instead.

246
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,733
Did I say anything?

247
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,633
Because I met you on the bus,
I couldn't even sleep.

248
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,700
Gosh. I'm sorry.

249
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,333
I disrupted your precious sleep.

250
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,267
No, I mean, I didn't sleep
because I didn't want to.

251
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,733
My house must not have been that uncomfortable.

252
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,033
You even snored loudly as you fell asleep.

253
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,300
- When did I snore?
- I couldn't sleep because it was noisy.

254
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,667
What? Do you have proof?

255
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,867
You said you had things
to do. I'll go back down.

256
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,233
I'll give you a ride.

257
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,367
It's fine.

258
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,233
I'm going.

259
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:37,933
Kang Hee.

260
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:40,400
Hey, Ji Kang Hee! Get off.

261
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,900
What?

262
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,500
Come out. This way.

263
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:47,733
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,300
Come quickly.

265
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,167
- Aren't you going?
- No, sir, I'm sorry.

266
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,500
Yes.

267
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,833
- Please drive safely.
- Yes.

268
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:03,867
Why?

269
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,400
Let's hang out just one more day.

270
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,433
If I had followed you to Seoul,

271
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,133
I'm curious what it would have been like.

272
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,900
Let's try it.

273
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:27,767
Yes, let's see if we can

274
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:30,967
start again.

275
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
Make sure the volume never goes down.

276
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, rest assured.

277
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,733
What's this?

278
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:44,267
<i>Mom, something urgent came up.
I can't go to the performance today.</i>

279
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,333
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

280
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,467
What is this?

281
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,567
Can't go to the performance…

282
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,267
What's he up to?

283
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,467
What, Yeon Soo?

284
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:58,200
Is this about not wanting to do a proposal?

285
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,500
He did seem quite hesitant.

286
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
If the proposal doesn't happen…

287
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,600
What about the marriage?

288
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,500
What in the world is he thinking?

289
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,800
This kid! There's definitely
something going on.

290
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:19,267
Hey, where are you going
without your hair done?

291
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,467
Is my hair the issue now?

292
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,533
Oh my, you!

293
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:25,300
<i>Ms. Yoon, something urgent came up.
I don't think I can make it today.</i>

294
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,367
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

295
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,367
- Madam.
- Ms. Yoon.

296
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,433
You know about today's performance, right?

297
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,700
When are you going?

298
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,533
Yes, madam.

299
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,933
About that performance,

300
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,867
I don't think I can make it today
due to some urgent matters.

301
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,233
You must have had high
expectations. I'm really sorry.

302
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,733
Where is Yeon Soo now?

303
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,567
The director went to Seoul yesterday.

304
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,533
Yesterday? Yesterday? Why?

305
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,100
Please leave, madam.

306
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,000
- Where is Kang Hee?
- You can't come in here.

307
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,700
Where is Kang Hee?

308
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,600
Ah, did you come to meet the manager?

309
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,800
She went to Seoul, yesterday.

310
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,767
What?

311
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,300
Hey, drink it.

312
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:24,433
I went to the construction site,
and they said Ji Kang Hee also went to Seoul.

313
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,800
Why are you like this again?

314
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,167
Just sit quietly and finish up your hair.

315
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,200
No.

316
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,700
My intuition is accurate.

317
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:38,667
Hey, try to figure this out quickly.

318
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,467
While talking about this, it seems like
it's going to dry out my own fate.

319
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:44,033
What's making you feel so anxious now?

320
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:47,600
They are definitely together.

321
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,133
I'm telling you, my intuition is right.

322
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:28,333
You.

323
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,067
How did you know about this place?

324
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,633
Be honest. You've been here, haven't you?

325
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,600
With a girl.

326
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:43,367
Won't you speak? You're acting weird.

327
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,800
Eating together like this
brings back old memories.

328
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,367
It tastes good after not having it for a while.

329
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,500
For a while?

330
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,333
<i>[No entry for outsiders!
Boyfriends, friends NO!]</i>

331
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,367
Is he your boyfriend?

332
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,167
A childhood friend from my hometown.

333
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,367
Does that make sense?

334
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,033
You're just friends with
someone who looks like that?

335
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:17,600
Can I show him the room where I used to live?

336
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,400
You're not even moving in, so no.

337
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,567
Oh, please don't be like that.

338
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,200
Can't I just look around a bit and then leave?

339
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,233
I'll be quiet and then leave.

340
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:32,167
Yes, take your time
and look around comfortably.

341
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,867
Thank you.

342
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:35,967
Thank you.

343
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,700
This is your first time
at a goshiwon, isn't it?

344
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,500
It's quite cozy.

345
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,433
Still, it's livable once you get used to it.

346
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,500
There's also a rooftop here.
It's pretty decent.

347
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,533
When was it?

348
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,900
It was when I was laid off from the company.

349
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:19,167
Just then, the boiler exploded,
and the water supply stopped working.

350
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,433
But then, I got a call from Ah Reum.

351
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:26,467
Ah Reum asked if she could
stay for just one night.

352
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,900
How could I let her stay?

353
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,767
Wouldn't it have been better
if you two slept together?

354
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,233
How could two people sleep together
when they couldn't even lie down?

355
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,133
Shall I lie down and check?

356
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,367
Hey, you can't even stretch out your legs.

357
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,933
But I did stretch them out.

358
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,667
Your head is up high.

359
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,933
This is my pillow.

360
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:52,967
You lie down, too.

361
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,100
Ugh, hey.

362
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,233
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

363
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,933
Kang Hee, should I get you a drink?

364
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,333
It's okay.

365
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:26,633
You saw everything, right?

366
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:27,700
Yes.

367
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,567
<i>[Golden Gilt Studio]</i>

368
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,467
What? You haven't left yet?

369
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,400
Ma'am, I'm going to return to Seoul.

370
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:41,967
Why all of a sudden?

371
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,167
Because I don't want to go to Hana-eup.

372
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,567
I can't take the countryside life anymore.

373
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:50,400
You said not to touch the Hana-eup
project and to leave it to you.

374
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,600
Why? What happened?

375
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,400
There are some reasons for it.

376
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,800
No, just go.

377
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,167
Why? I've been here long enough.

378
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,067
- It's not beautiful.
- What?

379
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:05,267
What do you think is the ultimate beauty?

380
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,800
The beauty of a good finish.

381
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,833
Not giving up on something you started
and carrying it through to the end.

382
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,367
How beautiful is that.

383
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:17,400
That's why I'm going to see it
through to the end.

384
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,200
Where to?

385
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,933
As far as my instinct takes me.

386
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,367
Do you perhaps mean Mr. Ji Chun Pil?

387
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,700
The beauty of a good finish! Go down right now.

388
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,767
You're doing well.

389
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:54,967
I won.

390
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,800
- You're happy?
- Yeah.

391
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,167
- Follow me.
- Is it 1 to 0?

392
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:17,400
It's really dazzling! So dazzling!

393
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,033
This one, too.

394
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,167
Two each?

395
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
The last one.

396
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,667
You saw it, didn't you?

397
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,233
Your condition must be good,

398
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,200
since you slept so soundly.

399
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,400
I said I'm sorry.

400
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,567
Take this and keep it, okay?

401
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,333
- Is it mine?
- Yes, take it.

402
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,367
The teddy bear in my room is mine,
so leave this one in your room.

403
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,000
Since you picked this one out, it's yours.

404
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,933
That stupid bear is
originally mine. Give it back.

405
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,400
No, it's mine, okay?

406
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,233
It's mine, it has always been mine.

407
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:57,333
You left it behind.

408
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,167
When did I leave it? It's mine!

409
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,400
I've had it for a much longer time.

410
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,033
It's 3 to 0.

411
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,900
Ah, what should I do?

412
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,400
Heart. Heart!

413
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,433
Ha…

414
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,900
There's a teddy bear!

415
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,533
Actually, I recommended that to your father.

416
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,133
I told him that you liked teddy bears.

417
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,233
What?

418
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,033
You have the condom I gave you that time.

419
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,900
Could that really have been
a motel promotion item?

420
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,600
Well…

421
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:36,167
Ah, really! There isn't a single
one that came out right.

422
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,833
- Why? It came out well, it's pretty.
- Can't you even make a proper heart?

423
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,133
No, it's just that the direction is different
for you and me, that's all.

424
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,333
This won't do.

425
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,500
All five of us can come next time
and take a photo together.

426
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
I wonder if we can all fit in the picture.

427
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,800
Just take the picture when I say so.
Why don't you listen?

428
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,233
I have been listening all along.

429
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,600
Ah Reum, it was not me. We have a picture for…

430
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,567
Kang Hee, you're really having fun, aren't you?

431
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,700
Who are you talking about?

432
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:08,200
Are you with our Yeon Soo?

433
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
Give it to Yeon Soo right now!

434
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
You shouldn't do this here.
Please give me the phone.

435
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,233
- Let go!
<i>- Please, give it to me quickly!</i>

436
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,700
<i>[Ah Reum]</i>

437
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:24,533
Let's go.

438
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:31,467
They're together. I'm sure!

439
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:34,967
What's wrong with being together?
It's nice to live like that,

440
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,933
relying on each other.

441
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,767
What if they develop feelings?

442
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:39,900
What are you saying?

443
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,133
I'm not doing this without a reason.

444
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,767
Does that make sense to you, Chun Pil?

445
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,600
Half the world is men and the other half women.

446
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,300
Why does it have to be those two?

447
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,833
They're not even in any
kind of relationship yet.

448
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,533
Can't you just watch and see how it goes?

449
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,600
Chun Pil, you are always like this.

450
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,700
I warned you even back then.

451
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,300
Make sure Kang Hee's mother
and Yeon Soo's father never meet.

452
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:14,100
You ignored me, and said
they weren't in that kind of relationship.

453
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,000
But what happened then?

454
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,633
They eloped because they fell for each other.

455
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,867
Did you know that?

456
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,367
Ten years ago,

457
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,333
if you had followed me to Seoul then,
we might have been finished a long time ago.

458
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,167
Would it have been like that?

459
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,133
We were young back then,

460
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:50,867
but things are different now.

461
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:54,367
The rumors following us,

462
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,600
the stares, the finger-pointing,

463
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,500
we could ignore all that.

464
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,233
But, Yeon Soo,

465
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,033
we can't change our parents.

466
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,367
Neither you nor me.

467
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:39,000
If only you had lived well
with Kang Hee's mother back then,

468
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:42,033
I would be happy with Yeon Soo's father.

469
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:45,500
Who knows if we would've had a happy ending?

470
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,367
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

471
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,967
I'm not blaming you now.

472
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:58,767
But Kang Hee and Yeon Soo's
relationship it's simply impossible.

473
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,267
Just keep that in mind.

474
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,767
What are you going to say to your mom?

475
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:23,533
I'll explain it well.

476
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,767
Everything will be alright.

477
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,233
Do you think I don't know her?

478
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,833
It won't be fine.

479
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,467
We have to be alright.

480
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,333
We're friends, after all.

481
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:20,067
Mom.

482
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,367
I knew this would happen.

483
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,167
Mom, we met by chance on the bus.
Isn't it a coincidence?

484
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:30,967
Lies!

485
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,033
You tell me.

486
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:38,000
Would you believe it if I told you?

487
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,967
What?

488
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,033
Hey, that…

489
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,100
Hey!

490
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,300
- Mom!
- Hey!

491
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,567
- What are you doing?
- Lies, lies!

492
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:48,867
- Listen to me, please.
- Hey, you!

493
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,267
<i>The power is off…</i>

494
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:54,400
The phone is turned off.

495
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,667
Kang Hee's phone is turned off too?

496
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:59,400
They couldn't possibly be
together for real, could they?

497
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,900
Something is definitely off.

498
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,667
When Ms. Su Ji called earlier,

499
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,800
she said Kang Hee was talking
about being with someone.

500
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,767
Could it really be Yeon Soo?

501
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,200
Since you're best friends,
you must have talked about it.

502
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,233
Gosh! You always take
Kang Hee's side, don't you?

503
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,233
Hey, let's say Ji Kang Hee could do that.

504
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:20,400
But what about Yeon Soo,
do you trust your Yeon Soo?

505
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
If the two of them are in
Seoul right now, you think

506
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,167
Yeon Soo is saying "ah, this is water!
That's a stone! It's Ji Kang Hee!"

507
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,933
When the love of his life he's been
waiting for is right in front of his eyes?

508
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,100
Come on, be honest. From a man's perspective.

509
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,200
See, Kang Hee comes alone.

510
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,267
Kang Hee, I'm sorry. You were
really startled earlier, right?

511
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:43,167
You know how she is.

512
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,500
Hey! It was a misunderstanding, right?

513
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,267
You weren't with Yeon Soo.

514
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,633
Yeon Soo slept in my house.

515
00:37:57,267 --> 00:38:00,433
Hey, Kang Hee! Were you really with Yeon Soo?

516
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,200
No, hey!

517
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,467
Hey, Ji Kang Hee!

518
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:11,200
Did you really go to Seoul with Yeon Soo?

519
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,033
You know you can tell me.

520
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,667
You know that I am always on your side.

521
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,167
If I tell you, all of them will know.

522
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,167
Then everyone in Hana-eup will know.

523
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:26,767
So,

524
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,300
are you seeing Yeon Soo again, by any chance?

525
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,300
You also slept in my house.

526
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,467
How is Yeon Soo any different?

527
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:38,167
Got it.

528
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,233
If you have something you want
to say later, tell me then.

529
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,267
You got it?

530
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,467
- Yes.
- I'm leaving. Rest well.

531
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:03,567
Huh? Director, you left early today.

532
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,267
Uh?

533
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
This little guy eats well.

534
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:12,100
Maybe because he's so carefree,
he sleeps well and recovers quickly.

535
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,133
I should start looking for a place
to send him for adoption.

536
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,833
Director, about the performance…

537
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,567
I didn't plan to watch it.

538
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,000
If you didn't plan to go either,

539
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,867
why did you send the tickets?

540
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:29,667
It's confusing.

541
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,733
Uh, that…

542
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:36,067
I think my mother did that because
she wants us to get together quickly.

543
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,300
So, it was sent by your mother?

544
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
The flowers too?

545
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,567
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

546
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,400
Director,

547
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
we should probably wrap things up quickly.

548
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:12,467
Shall I do it with the one I prepared?

549
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,533
Or should we go with the one you prepared?

550
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,600
Listen, Ms. Yoon.

551
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,000
You do realize this request
is truly unreasonable, right?

552
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,933
But, could we delay the explanation a bit?

553
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
Why?

554
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,133
It just doesn't seem like the right time now.

555
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:30,167
Why is it not the right time?

556
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,667
I think it's exactly the right time, though.

557
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,667
If we say we've broken up now,

558
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,767
all the blame will be poured on Kang Hee.

559
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:47,133
You seem to only care about her.

560
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:49,367
I'm truly sorry.

561
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:53,467
Let's do it after Kang Hee leaves.

562
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,333
If there is any criticism, I'll take it all.

563
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,400
And if there is anything to be responsible for,
I'll take all the responsibility, so…

564
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,767
I don't understand why I should do that.

565
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:04,067
Wouldn't it be better to take the
criticism and responsibility now?

566
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:10,067
The longer it goes on, the
harder it gets for you too, right?

567
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:20,433
Hello! How are you?

568
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:26,967
Director Geum didn't come with you?

569
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,000
No.

570
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,133
Director Geum has heard the rumors too.

571
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,100
I don't think it's a ring.

572
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:45,300
Really?

573
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,333
Just go with something ordinary.

574
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,933
Hey! How about these earrings?

575
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,600
Why? These are nice to wear on a regular basis.

576
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:59,300
- This.
- Hey, it's too much.

577
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,667
It's more excessive than a ring.

578
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:04,433
If I'm going to buy a gift, it should be
something a country vet could never afford.

579
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:06,033
I thought we were playing fair.

580
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,800
Is this fair play to you right now?

581
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,733
I can win without this.

582
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:12,900
This is just…

583
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,833
Like the champagne of victory.

584
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,767
I'll take this one, please.

585
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:22,400
The two of them got off the same bus.

586
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:27,600
Chun Pil, I couldn't sleep.

587
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,167
Let the kids handle their own affairs,
and let us live our lives now.

588
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,467
Ah, seriously!

589
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,033
No way!

590
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,000
I can't do that until at least
one of them gets married.

591
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Why do we have the same ancestral rites?

592
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,967
The people in Hana-eup are all going
to gossip and point fingers.

593
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,433
Why does our Yeon Soo have to go through that?

594
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:54,133
Since when have you been
worried about Yeon Soo?

595
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:59,600
Since when?

596
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,367
Am I not his mother?

597
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:04,300
Well, someone who's so worried about Yeon Soo

598
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,367
leaves the entire upbringing of
Yeon Soo to his grandpa? Huh?

599
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:12,967
Do you know how many times Yeon Soo took
a leave of absence because of your divorces?

600
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,000
And because he was taking care of his grandpa?

601
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:19,933
What are you doing?

602
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,500
- What?
- When Yeon Soo's father died,

603
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,533
you made the promise

604
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:28,100
that you would take care of our father,

605
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,900
and told me not to worry and to live my life.

606
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,100
Are you sorry?

607
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:39,267
Why did you marry a woman who is unfaithful?

608
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:42,000
She's not that kind of woman, ok?

609
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,233
- I said she's not.
- She's not?

610
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:47,367
Everyone knows, but you're
the only one denying it. Why?

611
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,733
Kang Hee is just like her mother too.

612
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:55,167
Coming from Seoul with a man,

613
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,200
and then dares to look at my Yeon Soo?

614
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,933
Oh my!

615
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:02,500
Hey! Park Soon Ja!

616
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,200
Snap out of it, you!

617
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,467
Trying to change your miserable
and pitiful life by changing your name.

618
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:13,533
What's changed after you changed your name?

619
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:15,033
What is it?

620
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:19,333
If you keep this up,
I'll call you Park Soon Ja!

621
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,767
When people whisper about the kids,

622
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:26,400
we should try to understand and just let it be,

623
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,033
instead of pointing fingers
and trying to divide them.

624
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:33,100
So what is it, then?

625
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,533
Honestly, while you worry like that,

626
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:41,000
have you ever thought about how much
Yeon Soo or Kang Hee might be worrying?

627
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,900
Ji Chun Pil! How could you do this to me?

628
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,533
As if you've done anything right!

629
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,400
How long are you going to keep this up?

630
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,733
Chun Pil, just watch!

631
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,633
Hey!

632
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:01,333
Did I say something wrong?

633
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,700
Hello! I'd like to visit a patient.

634
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,567
Park Soon Ja… No, Park Su Ji.

635
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,833
- You can go that way.
- Thank you.

636
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:33,000
Mom, are you okay?

637
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,200
Yeon Soo,

638
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,467
you…

639
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,467
Move out from the motel right now.

640
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:44,667
Okay, I'll go home.

641
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:50,800
Well, that's a bit…

642
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:56,833
I need my privacy, so look for another place.

643
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,667
Aren't there other motels?

644
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,833
Or kick Kang Hee out.

645
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,267
That's Kang Hee's home, Mom.

646
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:11,667
When she first came, she went
to a different motel with that guy.

647
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,667
Mom, by any chance,

648
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:21,600
did you file the complaint
against the construction site?

649
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,633
Do you think it was just me?

650
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:28,233
The people of Hana-eup all agreed.

651
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:31,333
What on earth did Kang Hee do wrong
that you're going this far?

652
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,133
She's that woman's daughter.

653
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:39,867
The woman who seduced your father
and led him to his death.

654
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:42,733
If you put it that way, then it was you first.

655
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,733
The day Kang Hee's little brother died.

656
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,267
You called out her father, right?

657
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,200
Is that the same thing?

658
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,133
Chun Pil and I are pretty much like siblings.

659
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:01,900
- Those two are…
- Us too.

660
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,100
I'm just friends with Kang Hee. Just friends.

661
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,000
We can't even be friends?

662
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
You can't do it. It's not allowed.

663
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,300
If you keep circling around Kang Hee like that,

664
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,767
this ward will become my room, for life.

665
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:27,367
Deok Gu, did you join too?

666
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,100
Chun Pil,

667
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,900
what good would it do if people
start digging up the past again?

668
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,867
No.

669
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:38,800
How should I say this?

670
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,933
Think about it. The two of them
just rode the bus together once, that's all.

671
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:46,067
I mean, bluntly speaking, did the kids date?

672
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,267
Or did they get married or something?

673
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,767
Why? Why on earth are you all acting like this?

674
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,833
The point is to stop it
before it gets to that, isn't it?

675
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,033
Quit the chatter and send Kang Hee to Seoul.

676
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,967
Or else, well…

677
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,833
Or marry Su Ji off somewhere.

678
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,767
You, really…

679
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,200
Hey, you're back?

680
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:20,767
You said you had something to say.

681
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,267
Hm?

682
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,567
Ah, good.

683
00:48:25,867 --> 00:48:27,933
Every time I think of you,

684
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,233
this is where I come.

685
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:36,367
Look, there… look at that.

686
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,567
The migratory birds flying away.

687
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:42,400
Sometimes I see them
and think of you, that's why.

688
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,067
- You're saying I am like those birds?
- That's how it was.

689
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:49,567
Those little guys fly all the
way here from Russia.

690
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:53,733
Covering thousands of miles,
flapping their wings.

691
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:55,333
Trying to survive.

692
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,733
So, that's all behind you leaving and all that.

693
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:01,633
I just thought, "it's the law of nature."

694
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:04,667
That's how I found solace, you know.

695
00:49:06,467 --> 00:49:11,133
Chun Pil, you've really thought of
everything to ease your mind.

696
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:14,767
But then, when the time comes,

697
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:19,400
these little guys come back
again, to their homeland.

698
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,100
But I'm not coming back.

699
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,267
Oh, well. Who is this person in front of me?

700
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,967
You know, I just came to work for a while.

701
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,233
Got it.

702
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:37,467
Even if you leave after a while,

703
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:41,600
I just want you to be comfortable, that's all.

704
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:45,400
You don't have to worry about what people say.

705
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,833
You don't have to think that
you're going to be kicked out.

706
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,733
Just…

707
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,400
go when it's convenient for you.

708
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,767
Of course.

709
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,633
I came here to work, and won't return
until the work is finished.

710
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:02,367
Okay, then that's fine.

711
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,233
Ah, also,

712
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:08,467
I need to go somewhere for a bit.

713
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:11,400
So you need to behave and take
care of yourself in the meantime.

714
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,900
Where are you going?

715
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,000
Traveling!

716
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:18,867
Excitingly!

717
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,700
You've got good fortune.

718
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,300
My name is Chun Pil, isn't it?

719
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,033
My life is always like a spring day!

720
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:34,067
That's just your own thought.

721
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,267
Where can you find such a gloomy spring?

722
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,400
Yahoo!

723
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:44,833
Yahoo!

724
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,600
<i>[The first step to safety
is through safety gear]</i>

725
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,667
Are you done with work already?

726
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:57,533
Oh, my! You've finally arrived.

727
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:59,033
But, where did everyone go?

728
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:02,167
We received a suspension order.

729
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,300
What?

730
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:07,267
- Why?
- Well, something about the noise, the dust.

731
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:10,200
The fence has crossed onto
the road, this and that.

732
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,667
What? Why now?

733
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:13,567
Where is the manager?

734
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,667
It seems this is all because of her.

735
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:24,467
It's so quiet without the construction.

736
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:25,633
Are you the one who did it?

737
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:26,667
Was it only me?

738
00:51:27,233 --> 00:51:29,200
This kid has talent in this area.

739
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,533
They lodged numerous
complaints in great detail.

740
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:35,133
Hey, even if you build a building,
you couldn't file that many claims.

741
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:39,533
But if the construction gets prolonged,
doesn't it mean Ji Kang Hee stays longer?

742
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:40,800
Hey. Jeez!

743
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,767
Will the locals just stay quiet?

744
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,433
Right now, they're keeping quiet
because of Mr. Chun Pil.

745
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,367
Do you think Ms. Su Ji will stay quiet?

746
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:49,833
- She's in the hospital even now, they say…
- Welcome.

747
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,100
- Still?
- It's the two-timer.

748
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:05,800
The work has been suspended,
but why didn't you report it?

749
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,867
I reported it to the CEO.

750
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:11,333
You bypassed me?

751
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,367
Why?

752
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:14,767
I want to go up to Seoul.

753
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,567
What kind of nonsense is that…

754
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,767
A beautiful finish, don't you
know? A beautiful finish.

755
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,700
If you start something,
you should see it through.

756
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,600
Complaints will keep coming in.

757
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,433
When I am here…

758
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,433
No, it's not like you are making a
racket at the construction site,

759
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,867
nor are stirring up dust with
a fan. So, why exactly?

760
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,767
You there!

761
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:34,467
Do you have something to say to us?

762
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:41,600
Seems like you've finished
talking. I'll be going now.

763
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,700
Okay.

764
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:06,500
What should I know?

765
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,433
Hello!

766
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:17,600
I…

767
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,433
Did you hear I was admitted to the hospital?

768
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,833
- No.
- I feel like I might die because of you.

769
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:31,533
Let's talk openly and honestly.

770
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:35,767
You're all grown up now,
so I believe you'll understand.

771
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,500
It's unfortunate for you, right?

772
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,800
Being the daughter of such a woman.

773
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:55,900
What can you do about the blood
that runs in your veins?

774
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:57,733
I will listen no more.

775
00:53:57,733 --> 00:53:58,933
You…

776
00:53:58,933 --> 00:54:01,500
You're the spitting image of your mother.

777
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,567
Leaving behind a good husband like Chun Pil,

778
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,600
your mother seduced my husband and eloped.

779
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,867
It's exactly the same.

780
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:13,500
Leaving a man from Seoul
who's an heir to a hotel,

781
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,833
why do you keep hanging around Yeon Soo,
calling him a friend and such?

782
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,767
And when are you planning
to show your true colors?

783
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,067
Shall I reveal them now?

784
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:28,300
- What?
- Since my mom took your husband,

785
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:32,067
I guess it's okay for me to take your son.

786
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:36,667
Look… Look there!

787
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:38,500
I knew it would be like that.

788
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,400
Even if I die, I won't let
him be taken from me.

789
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,700
Our Yeon Soo, I will never give him up.

790
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:54,600
- Mom.
- Yeon Soo.

791
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,333
Make things clear here.

792
00:54:57,933 --> 00:54:59,567
Is it me or Kang Hee?

793
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:02,533
Me or Kang Hee?

794
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:03,867
Mom.

795
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,367
Why did you leave the
hospital? You're not well.

796
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:09,233
Mom, it makes me sad when you do that.

797
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:11,433
No, showing your true colors just like that…

798
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,800
- What if you get sick?
- She's revealing her true self.

799
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,200
- Mom.
- Right.

800
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,067
I…

801
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:21,367
I've become the man you dislike.

802
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,733
A man who knows your past.

803
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:31,400
How much did you hear?

804
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,767
Let's do this fairly.

805
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:37,767
I'll tell you about my dark past
even Esther doesn't know.

806
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,300
There's no need to make things up.

807
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:46,900
I ran away saying I didn't want to
marry her, and rumors spread

808
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:51,167
that I liked men.

809
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,533
Esther came to find me.

810
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:57,567
She cried, saying she understood
and it didn't matter.

811
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,800
This is as far as Esther knows the story.

812
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:06,167
There was a woman I met at that time.

813
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:08,300
A woman whose hobby was collecting men.

814
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:14,233
Esther thought I got hurt because
I was infatuated with that woman.

815
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:19,600
I just needed a rumor to spread
because of that woman.

816
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,233
What kind of rumor?

817
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,867
About my sexual preferences?

818
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:29,067
Might as well hate me a lot since
you dislike me, is that it? Right now?

819
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:32,233
I'm just saying you might also need a rumor.

820
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,567
I'll cover up the nonsense that
troubles you with my own rumors.

821
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,933
I'm still your official boyfriend.

822
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:17,600
<i>But, Yeon Soo,</i>

823
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:20,667
<i>we can't change our parents,</i>

824
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,800
<i>neither you nor me.</i>

825
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,933
<i>Yeon Soo!</i>

826
00:58:45,533 --> 00:58:46,733
<i>Yeon Soo!</i>

827
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:48,767
<i>Try to open your eyes!</i>

828
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:52,167
<i>Kang Hee, open your eyes!</i>

829
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:31,033
Feels good, right?

830
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:47,567
I've always wanted to come here just once.

831
00:59:48,267 --> 00:59:50,767
How did you know what I wanted?

832
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:54,767
Hey, it's so nice.

833
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,467
Over there, that used to be
all fields in the old days.

834
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,267
That's right.

835
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,467
It was here.

836
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:14,933
<i>- Is it warm now?
- Yes.</i>

837
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:54,367
<i>Oh, the kids.</i>

838
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:55,767
<i>They have fallen asleep.</i>

839
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,500
<i>They must have been tired.</i>

840
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,867
<i>I'm okay.</i>

841
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:05,567
You've never seen my father smile, have you?

842
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,400
When I was a kid,

843
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,467
I used to wish that Kang Hee's
mother was my mother.

844
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:19,167
I told you many lies.

845
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,367
I'm sorry.

846
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,000
<i>Let's go in, Yeon Soo.</i>

847
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,833
<i>Where have you been to be this late?</i>

848
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,633
<i>Clinic visit.</i>

849
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,700
<i>You went too?</i>

850
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:43,767
You were in this together?

851
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:47,333
Yeon Soo, you too?

852
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,400
I had no choice.

853
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:55,367
Back then, it was true I preferred
the other woman over you.

854
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,600
That's why I've been living
dragged around by you out of guilt.

855
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:08,100
Because of you, I also sent away Kang Hee.

856
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,667
I accepted those strange men
you brought as stepfathers.

857
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,133
Even when I had to give them
alimony and settlement money,

858
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:22,167
I never complained, not even once.

859
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,367
Because I thought it was
the punishment I deserved.

860
01:02:31,633 --> 01:02:33,533
The punishment

861
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,767
for nor loving my own mother truthfully.

862
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:48,333
But now, I think I have paid it off.

863
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:53,733
I'm planning to be independent of you, Mom.

864
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:56,733
Is all of this because of Kang Hee?

865
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,300
Kang Hee is absolutely off-limits.

866
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,267
You heard it too!

867
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:04,333
That she intends to take you away
like what her mother did to your dad.

868
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,267
As for Kang Hee,

869
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:10,733
she gets angry when sad,
and runs away when wronged.

870
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,233
The fact that Kang Hee speaks harshly,
even when she doesn't feel it,

871
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,700
means that she feels very wronged and sad, Mom.

872
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:27,967
All this time, Kang Hee and I

873
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:32,067
seemed to have endured
behind the wall of "friendship".

874
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:36,100
But I can't stand it any longer.

875
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:40,833
I am no longer going

876
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,767
to be friends with her.

877
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:06,467
I have something to say.

878
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:09,333
Me too.

879
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:02,667
Go out with me.
