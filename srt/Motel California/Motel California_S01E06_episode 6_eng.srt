1
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:30,150


2
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,433
Why do you keep doing this to me?

3
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,867
Cheon Yeon Soo, you!

4
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,133
Why did you help me?

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,300
Why would you? Who are you to help me?

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,467
Answer me.

7
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,700
Do you like me?

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,133
That's all I can do for you.

9
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,200
Because I can't wipe away your tears,

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,833
I can't hold you back as a discarded first love.

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,933
That's all I can do for you one last time, because that's all there is.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,133
Can I not even do that?

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
You don't like it?

14
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,967
One last time?

15
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,433
Who says it's the last time?

16
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,533
Why are you changing the ending as you please?

17
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:53,733
I know that the beginning and the end are always up to you.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,400
But I need some time.

19
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,000
Time? What time?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
Time to forget you.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,700
So don't worry.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,633
Don't feel pressured, and don't get angry.

23
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,233
Just give me some time.

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,467
 I hate that, that's why I hate it. 

25
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:34,210
 Because you know all about my dark past and my wounds.  

26
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,960
 That's why… 

27
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:39,100
 It hurts to see you. 

28
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:06,933
Couldn't find him?

29
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,700
It's over.

30
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,633
It was over from the start.

31
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,567
That's actually better.

32
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,433
 Kang Hee, where are you? 

33
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,000
 Please come to the police station now. 

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The man who claims to be Yeon Soo's mother's husband

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,133
is causing a scene and threatening to sue your father, so I…

36
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,500
Hello?

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,100
 Kang Hee. 

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,580
- Cheers. 
 - Let's have a drink.

39
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,200
   

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,167
Hey, Ah Reum, please just bring me a bottle of beer here.

41
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,233
Hey, Ah Reum, bring some soju, too.

42
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,333
Kang Hee.

43
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,800
- Oh? Hey. 
 - Come quick.

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,233
Everyone is gathered here now.

45
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,700
Hey.

46
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,600
I don't want to join.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Seok Kyeong was here too, hurry up.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,167
Hey, hey.

49
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,333
You came here looking for your boyfriend, right?

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,000
He was here just now, but he just left.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,067
Ji Kang Hee, I'll enjoy the meal, thanks.

52
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,633
Seok Kyeong gave us his credit card.

53
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,567
Originally it was just Seok Kyeong and us, but then the others came…

54
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,033
What's the most expensive thing here?

55
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,967
Order all the side dishes on the menu, from start to finish, all of them.

56
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah, he said we can use the credit card as much as we want.

57
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,067
Ji Kang Hee, it's okay, isn't it?

58
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,367
Why are you asking me that?

59
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,633
Please give me a glass here.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,933
Thank you.

61
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,967
Han Ah Reum, you've been on blind dates, right?

62
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,700
With the ophthalmologist.

63
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Last time, you went on a blind date with a dentist.

64
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,700
And this time, with an ophthalmologist?

65
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,033
It seems like you only go on blind dates with doctors.

66
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,500
That's only good if it works out well.

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,033
Does that mean all the blind dates didn't go well?

68
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,067
Ah Reum's family has a lot of money, right?

69
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,000
How could a public education employee have a lot of money?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,900
You say you don't have money, but you got a master's and PhD…

71
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,300
Honestly, what's the point of a degree if you're just lending books?

72
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,033
She would need it when going on blind dates, I guess.

73
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,133
- What? 
 - What?

74
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,667
Yeah, give it a try.

75
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,600
Who knows?

76
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,933
Maybe you'll snag a Prince Charming like Kang Hee.

77
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,567
Hey!

78
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,567
Hey?

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,133
Han Ah Reum can get angry, too?

80
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,520
Is it because Ji Kang Hee is next to you, so there's nothing to be afraid of?

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,000
Stop messing around.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,700
Let's go, Han Ah Reum.

83
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,933
Let's go.

84
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,733
Why are you listening to this crap?

85
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,233
Come on, let's just go.

86
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,333
- Ignorant punks. 
 - What? Ignorant?

87
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,733
How dare you? You only have a middle school education!

88
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,200
Don't you know whose fault it is that he only has a middle school education?

89
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,300
Seriously, you've killed my mood to drink.

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,133
Ji Kang Hee, what are we supposed to do if you leave, too?

91
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,564
Who's paying the bills here?

92
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:04,433
At last… I've achieved my dream. 
    

93
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,133
Thanks to Chun Pil.

94
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,300
What was your dream?

95
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,200
A divorce that doesn't cost money.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,200
I think a wedding that costs a lot of money is romantic,

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,833
and a divorce that doesn't cost much is preferable.

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,833
Su Ji, I have a favor to ask of you.

99
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:33,700
Next time you get married, never register the marriage.

100
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,100
I think I'll become a divorce lawyer because of you.

101
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,667
I guess he'd start building up some expertise.

102
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,000
It's already your fourth time, after all.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,300
That's right.

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,633
Hey. Don't ever think about getting a divorce

105
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:52,733
just because I'm like this. Okay?

106
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:56,633
These two get along well. How could that be possible?

107
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,567
No way.

108
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:02,100
You can just live by getting a divorce first, like she did.

109
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,433
Oh, Senior.

110
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,400
No, Unnie.

111
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,500
Unnie!

112
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,350
   

113
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Let's just go.

114
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,667
I can go alone.

115
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,200
You don't have to take me there.

116
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:21,433
Goodbye.

117
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,267
Be careful.

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,267
See, I told you to just come out quickly, but you didn't listen to me.

119
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,610
Everyone thinks we're getting married,

120
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,360
how could I do that?

121
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,533
It's because you've unnecessarily spread rumors.

122
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,767
I told you to stop it earlier.

123
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,467
Should we stop, then?

124
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah, let's stop.

125
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,267
Okay.

126
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,600
Then, let's go.

127
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,600
Where to?

128
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
To Senior Kang Hee.

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,200
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

130
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,467
The person you've been waiting for

131
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,067
is Senior Kang Hee, right?

132
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
"I've waited for you with my whole heart, without looking at anyone else."

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,367
"I have no intention of meeting anyone else but you for the rest of my life."

134
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:25,500
Go to her and tell her honestly.

135
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,867
Go and tell her right now!

136
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,067
Be careful.

137
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:37,233
If you say that to Senior Kang Hee,

138
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,133
then I will also clarify the rumor.

139
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,733
Okay?

140
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,567
Yeah, I told him we should break up.

141
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,167
It was my fault.

142
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,033
Even so…

143
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:09,933
After 20 years, he couldn't even wait a few months and fell for someone else?

144
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:13,133
Yeah, to the person who's liked me for over 20 years, I have nothing to say.

145
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,967
Even so…

146
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,333
He should have held out a little longer.

147
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,333
I'm also in Seoul now, with a proper job

148
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,067
and my own room all set up,

149
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,833
so if he comes to Seoul, I'm fine with it.

150
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,700
Has he completely fallen for Yoon Nan Woo that much?

151
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Yeah, he must be happy.

152
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:55,367
She was indeed pretty.

153
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,400
And her smile was pretty, too.

154
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,167
Even the voice was lovely.

155
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,033
Everything was pretty.

156
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,100
Is she on the phone?

157
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,233
Even so, he said he only liked me before.

158
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,600
He's a total liar.

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,500
What? He's going to forget about me now?

160
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,867
Jeez.

161
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,467
There's nothing more he can do?

162
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,867
Yes, I have nothing to say.

163
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,600
 Does he like her a lot? 

164
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,033
Why is she talking on the phone all night?

165
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,933
 He must be happy because his girlfriend is pretty. 

166
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:26,533
 He must be happy because her voice is beautiful. 

167
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,100
 Ugh, bad guy. 

168
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,267
 Bad guy. 

169
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,967
Did Ji Kang Hee come to torture me?

170
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,767
She said he wasn't her boyfriend.

171
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,167
 He's not my boyfriend, but my husband. 

172
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,267
 No. 

173
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,467
 He's not my husband, but on my side. 

174
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,233
 What about me? I'm on your side too, Kang Hee. 

175
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,633
 No, you are not. 

176
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:10,167
 Cheon Yeon Soo, 

177
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:13,033
 you're on your mom's side, your grandfather's side, 

178
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:16,167
 Mr. Chun Pil's side, Hana-eup's side, 

179
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:20,767
 the side of cows, chickens, pigs, animals, 

180
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,333
 and Yoon Nan Woo's side. 

181
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,500
 No, I'm not getting married to Yoon Nan Woo. 

182
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,100
 You need to be scolded. 

183
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,267
 I'll handle him. 

184
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,233
 Dare to avoid me? 

185
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,633
 You started it first. 

186
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,667
 You dare hit me here? 

187
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,800
 Hold on a second. 

188
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,200
 Did you just bite me? Come here. 

189
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,133
 Let go, let go! 

190
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,133
 Let go! I said let go! 

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,400
   

192
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,467
Good.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,467
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yes.

194
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:30,133
Did you take Ah Reum home safely?

195
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,567
Yes.

196
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,433
By the way, why did you do that yesterday?

197
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,067
What?

198
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,300
What about that?

199
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,267
Hey, is that what a friend does, just staying silent in that situation?

200
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:46,733
- You by any chance… 
 - Don't say it.

201
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,133
How dare I think that, considering my situation?

202
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,633
What's wrong with your situation?

203
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,967
I'm an orphan and only have a middle school education.

204
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,867
Jeez.

205
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,433
Please don't do this anymore.

206
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,867
The people at the bar that day, they're the ones who bullied you as a kid. Right?

207
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:22,033
"Kang Hee is doing great in Seoul."

208
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,033
"I'm falling for her and chasing after her.

209
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,967
Well, if Kang Hee likes me, I'll even get married."

210
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,367
When I said that, they were totally suffering from jealousy.

211
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,067
This is what you call revenge.

212
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,633
True revenge.

213
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:41,633
Why are you taking my revenge?

214
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,467
I'm your official boyfriend until the construction is done. Remember?

215
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,500
 I'll use you one more time, 

216
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,367
 just until the construction is done. 

217
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,533
 This time, I have a condition too. 

218
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:59,233
 If you're using me, I have to be your official boyfriend until the construction is done. 

219
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,933
 Do you really have to? 

220
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,733
 I don't want that. 

221
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,467
 Then go and clarify things to them. 

222
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,200
 I need to have at least some safety measures, too. 

223
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,333
 If we break up before the construction is finished, 

224
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,433
 then I'll be the bad guy, and you'll be the tragic heroine who got dumped. 

225
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,500
 No, that's not it. 

226
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,067
 I'll be the one who gets criticized in this neighborhood, no matter what. 

227
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,233
 So, you don't need to worry about that. 

228
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,900
 Oh, that's even more upsetting. 

229
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,700
 I can't stand it when people criticize you. 

230
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,867
 All right, then. 

231
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:30,433
 It doesn't matter to me. 

232
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,200
 So we have a deal, okay? 

233
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,967
 I'm your official boyfriend. 

234
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,867
 All right, official boyfriend. 

235
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,600
As your official boyfriend, I'm asking, what should we do today?

236
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,033
We don't have anything to do during the curing process, right?

237
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,933
I have a lot of work to do.

238
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,567
Where are you going?

239
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,800
Oh, Mr. Kwon again.

240
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Why do you keep blocking me only?

241
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:14,300
 Kang Hee, you're like my granddaughter. 

242
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,433
 Always smile brightly. 

243
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:24,667
 Kang Hee, congratulations on becoming a high school student. 

244
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,300
 Go buy a satchel. 

245
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,800
 Congratulations on your graduation. 

246
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,567
 Even when you go to high school, like now. 

247
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:37,000
 Don't forget the cool Ji Kang Hee. 

248
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,933
Hello.

249
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,733
Oh? Hello.

250
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,100
The director is not here right now.

251
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,133
I came today because I have something I want to ask you.

252
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,567
Unnie, you can speak casually.

253
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,233
I could ask Yeon Soo, but since it's a personal question,

254
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,067
I wanted to ask you directly.

255
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,033
I really hope you can answer me.

256
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,300
What is it?

257
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,633
- Your parents… 
 - Mr. Cheon.

258
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,633
Please ask him directly.

259
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,733
It doesn't seem like something I should say.

260
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,900
Please hear it directly from him.

261
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,800
What's going on?

262
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,200
Ms. Yoon. Are both of her parents still around?

263
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,700
Yes.

264
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,633
She must have grown up with a lot of love.

265
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,533
I guess so.

266
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,267
But why?

267
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,733
I came to ask about that.

268
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,833
I mean, whether both of her parents are still around,

269
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,533
and if she grew up with a lot of love.

270
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,733
Can you spare some time today?

271
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,033
I want to go and visit Grandpa.

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,900
I really want you to come with me.

273
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,500
Grandpa.

274
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,400
You know I'm really good at holding on, right?

275
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,700
I held on even when taking care of you was tough.

276
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,100
And when Mom caused trouble, and it was too much to handle, I held on well.

277
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,933
Even when I got kicked by a cow and broke my ribs,

278
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:16,133
I held on well, laughing it off.

279
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,000
But why can't I hold on when it comes to Kang Hee?

280
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:29,633
I know that there is someone else beside Kang Hee.

281
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:36,167
But Kang Hee's back keeps telling a different story.

282
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:43,533
She keeps saying that she's struggling and suffering.

283
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,333
So, I'm just going to tell her...

284
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,567
that I'll wait, and she can come back anytime if she's struggling.

285
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,933
You'll support me, right?

286
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:06,100
Grandpa, you've always been on mine and Kang Hee's side.

287
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:27,467
Grandpa, I'm here.

288
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,033
You're watching us, right?

289
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,333
I came to keep my promise.

290
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Isn't this Grandpa's ring?

291
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,500
Why do you have this?

292
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,600
I once went to see Grandpa...

293
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,067
because I wanted to go to Seoul with you.

294
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,267
 - Grandpa? 
 - Yes? 

295
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:17,000
 Grandpa, can't you persuade Yeon Soo? 

296
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,067
 About what? 

297
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,367
 We agreed to go to Seoul together. 

298
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,633
 Let's go to Seoul where no one knows us 

299
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,933
 and enjoy a free campus life together. 

300
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:29,133
 But suddenly, Yeon Soo says he won't go. 

301
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,800
 Kang Hee, 

302
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,767
 my health has gotten a bit worse. 

303
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,867
 How serious is it? 

304
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,433
 Are you seriously unwell? 

305
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,067
 Does Yeon Soo know? 

306
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,333
 That's why Yeon Soo… 

307
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,267
 Then he should've told me. 

308
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,100
 How serious is it? 

309
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,867
 Kang Hee, 

310
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:09,567
 would you do me a favor? 

311
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,633
 Open it. 

312
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,067
 It's pretty, isn't it? 

313
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:35,567
 This is the ring I gave to Yeon Soo's grandmother as a present. 

314
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,480
 After Yeon Soo's grandmother passed away, 

315
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,200
 Yeon Soo asked for that ring so desperately, 

316
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,400
 but I didn't give it to him. 

317
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,600
 I wanted to give it to Yeon Soo's partner, a granddaughter-in-law. 

318
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,400
 I don't know how long I have left to live, 

319
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,450
 and I can't guarantee 

320
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,660
 I'll be able to give this to you while I'm still in my right mind. 

321
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,467
 So, Kang Hee, 

322
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:08,467
 when Yeon Soo meets the right one, 

323
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,167
 will you give it to him? 

324
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,700
 I hope Yeon Soo's partner is a cheerful and kind child, 

325
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,933
 loved by both parents in an ordinary family. 

326
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,500
 You'll do me a favor, right? 

327
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,567
That's nonsense.

328
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:44,400
The motel construction was just an excuse.

329
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,167
I heard you might get married, so I came to check.

330
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,567
Grandfather was right.

331
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,567
For you, Cheon Yeon Soo,

332
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:57,167
it won't be someone like me, who's pugnacious,

333
00:25:57,167 --> 00:26:00,267
but someone lovely like Yoon Nan Woo.

334
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,500
What does that mean?

335
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,967
I'm glad you met a good person,

336
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:07,467
and now I can keep my promise...

337
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,333
with Grandpa.

338
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,133
No, Kang Hee, that's not it.

339
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:18,533
I hope you live happily for generations in this countryside, Hana-eup,

340
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,300
Cheon Yeon Soo.

341
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,700
♫  I realized it as I stared quietly into your eyes  ♫

342
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,400
♫  My love for you, fearlessly, keeps growing   ♫

343
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,433
It's all over now.

344
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,900
It's really over.

345
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:13,000
♫  Will a part of my sincerity reach you today?  ♫

346
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,133
 If I keep enduring here, 

347
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,633
 like that motel, my life will also go dark. 

348
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:22,933
 You're doing just fine. 

349
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,667
 But I can't endure it. 

350
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,900
 I'll never come back here again. 

351
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,200
 Isn't it amazing? 

352
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,633
 We've received a celebration from the people. 

353
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:45,567
 The elders in Hana-eup gave blessings. 

354
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:48,300
 But to us, 

355
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,433
 they acted so cruelly and harshly, 

356
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:55,167
 pretending to care and look out for us. 

357
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,867
 Why do you remember such things? 

358
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:01,167
 You should erase those memories 

359
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,900
 and live on, forgetting them. 

360
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,633
 I know, right? 

361
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:06,767
 I should have done that. 

362
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,367
 I intend to do so now. 

363
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,067
 I won't have to listen to this kind of crap anymore. 

364
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,770
♫  How much I missed these moments every night  ♫

365
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,960
♫  I love you  ♫

366
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:36,610
♫  My confession to you feels more precious than yesterday  ♫

367
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,430
♫  My shy, hesitant first words to you  ♫

368
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,800
♫  Those seemingly meaningless words  ♫

369
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:51,670
♫  contained my feelings for you  ♫

370
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,110
♫  I may not have said  ♫

371
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,790
♫  "I love you"  ♫

372
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:07,830
♫  But it was all love to me  ♫

373
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,500
♫  Look, I'm still shaking  ♫

374
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,133
I'm sorry.

375
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:18,267
You must have had it harder than anyone.

376
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:20,567
I was too ignorant.

377
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,167
I'm sorry, Kang Hee.

378
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,440
♫  But I was the most sincere  ♫

379
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,580
♫  Every day that passed took me a lot of courage  ♫

380
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,670
♫  I might be late in saying  ♫

381
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,510
♫  "I love you"  ♫

382
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,867
So that's why you asked...

383
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,667
if Ms. Yoon has both parents and if she grew up being loved.

384
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,233
Those words were really painful to me.

385
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,433
I could never be that kind of person.

386
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,767
No matter how hard I try,

387
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,000
I can never become that kind of person.

388
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,400
Then, did you just push me away because of Grandpa?

389
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:25,233
It's not the whole reason, but that was part of it.

390
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:40,867
Hey.

391
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,933
Hey, Kang Hee! Ji Kang Hee!

392
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,867
Hey, what are you doing?

393
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,767
Hey.

394
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,867
Just come out, it's dangerous.

395
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:59,133
Wait, I need to find this.

396
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:02,833
Why are you looking for it? What are you planning to do with it?

397
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,633
I should find it and give it to her.

398
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,667
To me, it's like Grandpa's last will.

399
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:10,433
Who are you going to give it to?

400
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,600
That's not it.

401
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,467
What?

402
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:18,933
I'm not marrying Yoon Nan Woo.

403
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,767
Kang Hee, are you okay?

404
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,300
Kang Hee.

405
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,167
Hey.

406
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:05,100
Never mind, you're cold too.

407
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,133
It's okay.

408
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,167
You'll catch a cold.

409
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,867
It's fine.

410
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,467
It's your coat.

411
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,133
You can have it.

412
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,367
Aren't you going to marry Yoon Nan Woo?

413
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,233
How come?

414
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,933
Why not?

415
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,567
You know what Hana-eup is like.

416
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:34,467
 Yeon Soo is setting up a clinic with Yoon Nan Woo. 

417
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,033
 What? Really? 

418
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:40,500
 So that's why he said he was going to get a job in Seoul, but ended up staying in Hana-eup? 

419
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,000
 That's crazy. 

420
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,133
 He made a good decision. 

421
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,333
 Yoon Nan Woo is much better than Ji Kang Hee. 

422
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,467
 She's young and cute. 

423
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,033
 Oh dear! 

424
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,400
 I was envious. 

425
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,567
 I thought we were going to marry Han Woo off first. 

426
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,233
 So when are they getting married? 

427
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,570
 I don't know. 

428
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,067
 A vet couple? 

429
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:03,033
 Oh my, that's nice. 

430
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:06,900
 Well… I mean, as long as Yeon Soo is happy, 

431
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,633
 I have no objections. 

432
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:13,700
 It means I'm the one with an open mind. 

433
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,233
You haven't changed one bit,

434
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,633
now or then.

435
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,467
What about you?

436
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,700
I mean, that man.

437
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,367
Didn't I tell you?

438
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:34,600
When I go to Seoul, I'm going to meet a lot of men.

439
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,960
And among them, I'll marry the most fantastic man.

440
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
What kind of man is a "fantastic man"?

441
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,533
A man who's nothing like Chun Pil.

442
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,633
So, is he that kind of man?

443
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:52,233
He's from a different world than me.

444
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,933
He's probably never once thought that someone might dislike him.

445
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:02,333
He has probably never felt inferior.

446
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,733
He's truly someone...

447
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,700
with no twisted or negative traits in his personality.

448
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,367
So sometimes,

449
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,833
I feel envious when I look at him.

450
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:25,667
So, you said it's good.

451
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:28,700
Hey, wait a minute.

452
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,533
Why do you guys look like that?

453
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,833
Where have you been?

454
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,800
What are you talking about? We just met up front.

455
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,633
Doesn't seem like you've just met, huh?

456
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,833
- Where did you guys go? 
 - Just leave them alone.

457
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,367
 Yeon Soo is off-limits to you. 

458
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,800
 Just leave them alone. 

459
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,067
 - What? 
 - Hobbies? 

460
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:50,167
 - That won't do. 
 - Why? 

461
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,600
 You know how hard it was for him. Right? 

462
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
 I've decided to stop pretending to be engaged to Ms. Yoon. 

463
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,500
 We decided to clarify the rumors. 

464
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,500
 So what? 

465
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,767
 What does that have to do with me? 

466
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,300
 That's just how it is. 

467
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,133
Oh, it's hot.

468
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,033
Oh my, it's cold.

469
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,600
Oh, it's warm.

470
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,433
Huh? Ms. Hwang.

471
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,400
Oh, Kang Hee.

472
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,200
What brings you here?

473
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,533
I didn't come for any special reason.

474
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,733
Am I not allowed here?

475
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,600
The carpentry work hasn't even started, but the vibe is already here.

476
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,800
Now that I've seen it, I'm even more excited.

477
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,633
Why are you wearing heels?

478
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:48,567
Do you want to use the wheelchair again?

479
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,900
I bought it to commemorate not having to use a wheelchair anymore.

480
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,333
I'm meeting someone today.

481
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,400
- Today? 
 - Who?

482
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,633
Kang Hee, what do you think about the client?

483
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:02,033
He's gentle and nice, right?

484
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,667
Well…

485
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,700
Of course, he's the best.

486
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,267
Right?

487
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,000
The truth is, I've known him for a long time,

488
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,900
- and I'm considering seeing him seriously this time. 
 - What?

489
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,733
After surviving a near-death experience,

490
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:19,933
I realized it would be nice to have someone by my side who is on my side.

491
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,100
He's older than he looks.

492
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,967
I'm older than I look, too.

493
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:27,400
Do you know he's a widower with a child?

494
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,500
So what?

495
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,467
He's a dad who raised his daughter with devotion after getting hurt at a young age.

496
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,800
He really loved his daughter.

497
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,600
He said his daughter lost her favorite teddy bear.

498
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,100
So he wanted to give her a teddy bear as a birthday present.

499
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,667
I bought him one, the original Teddy Bear.

500
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,533
You're saying that you bought that for her?

501
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,967
Yes.

502
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:53,400
She must be in college by now.

503
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:56,567
Would she like me?

504
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,300
- Do you know how he became a widower? 
 - Huh?

505
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,267
Please ask about it.

506
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:08,900
They say the man's greatest accomplishment in life is womanizing.

507
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:18,567
Is the client's reputation that bad?

508
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,000
Do you know the client's name?

509
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,267
Of course. Ji Chun Pil.

510
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:28,067
How can his name be so classic and romantic?

511
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,833
Ji Chun Pil, Ji Kang Hee.

512
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,100
Doesn't it remind you of anything?

513
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,667
They have the same last name.

514
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,133
Kang Hee said she grew up in a motel, right?

515
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,967
- No way… 
 - Yes.

516
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:47,633
The only daughter of the client Ji Chun Pil is Ji Kang Hee.

517
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,400
It's ridiculous.

518
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:36,233
Are you, by any chance, Kkam Hee?

519
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,367
Why are you here?

520
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,700
What are you looking at?

521
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,033
Hey.

522
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,767
I heard about the secret of your birth today.

523
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:10,067
I really don't like your origin, seriously.

524
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,833
What are you doing?

525
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,267
- Are you taking it? 
 - I'm going to throw it away.

526
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:23,800
- Why are you throwing away my teddy bear? 
 - No, it's not.

527
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,133
This was bought by Mr. Chun Pil to impress a certain lady.

528
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,667
He did? For whom?

529
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:32,000
What are you talking about all of sudden?

530
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,167
My CEO.

531
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,700
Huh? Unbelievable.

532
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,533
You.

533
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:44,100
You know when I started calling Dad "Mr. Chun Pil"?

534
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
 Director. 

535
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,700
 - Ah, you're here… 
 - I'm a bit late. 

536
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,033
 Where have you been? 

537
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:01,200
 My brother died because of you. 

538
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,100
 Mom almost died, too. 

539
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,167
 Yes, that's… 

540
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:06,700
 Kang Hee, I'm sorry. 

541
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,300
 I'm late. I'm sorry. 

542
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,600
 Go, you have no right to be here. 

543
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,400
 Leave, from now on, you are not even my dad. 

544
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:20,767
 Kang Hee, I'm sorry, so sorry. 

545
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,933
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

546
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,833
 Oh dear, I did wrong. I'm sorry. 

547
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,533
 I will do better. I'm sorry. 

548
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,367
Even now, when I think about that day,

549
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:43,800
I wake up suddenly in anger and get mad.

550
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,767
Back then, Mr. Chun Pil acted like a caring husband, like a kind father,

551
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,900
and was going around lying to women.

552
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,933
He must have had a hard time with what happened that day, too.

553
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,600
Don't take his side.

554
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
Both Mr. Chun Pil and your mom…

555
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,267
My mom?

556
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,667
At the moment my brother died,

557
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,567
Chun Pil and Su Ji were together.

558
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,133
 Mom. 

559
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:25,033
 Mom! Mom, what's happening? 

560
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:28,333
 Kang Hee, please call Dad for me. 

561
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,533
 Please call Dad. 

562
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:32,133
 Please call Dad… 

563
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,200
 Mom. 

564
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,933
 Mom. 

565
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:41,000
 Mom. 

566
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
 Mom. 

567
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:49,200
When Mom and my little brother were dying,

568
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,233
Mr. Chun Pil was with your mom.

569
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,933
He went to Seoul to catch a conman who tricked your mom.

570
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,167
I will...

571
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:06,600
never forgive Mr. Chun Pil...

572
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,367
and your mom.

573
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,133
What about me?

574
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,667
You…

575
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,333
Can you abandon your mom?

576
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,900
Oh, is that your room?

577
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,533
Oh, Ms. Hwang.

578
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:05,100
I'd like to take a look at your room, and see if the dolls are okay.

579
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,600
Oh, no…

580
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,800
The room hasn't been cleaned.

581
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,833
You were here.

582
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:15,633
I have prepared a cup of warm tea before you go.

583
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:17,333
Let's have a drink downstairs.

584
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,633
- Oh, shall we? 
 - Yes, yes.

585
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:22,500
Kang Hee, I will be going then. Take care.

586
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,467
Ah, just a moment.

587
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:26,733
I will escort you, Ms. Hwang.

588
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:27,900
Will you?

589
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,200
No, it's okay, I can go alone.

590
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,667
You can't. It's too much to drive alone.

591
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:32,767
I came alone?

592
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:35,400
That's what I mean. Round-trip driving is really too much.

593
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,333
If you're really worried, ask Manager Keum.

594
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:42,633
- You should stay and watch over the site. 
 - No, I will escort you.

595
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:45,867
I want to go to Seoul.

596
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,140
It will take a lot of time for the concrete to cure,

597
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,960
and I have nothing to do.

598
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:53,900
I need to go. I want to go home.

599
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,633
It's hard living in a motel for a long time.

600
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:59,000
I want to rest in my own room.

601
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:07,400
 Then shall we go to the lobby and wait? 

602
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,567
 - Shall we? 
 - Yes. 

603
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:10,333
 Then I'll wait downstairs. 

604
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,100
 You heard it, right? 

605
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,567
I'll get going.

606
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,900
Do you want to drop by my house before you go?

607
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,067
I want to go home, wash up, and rest.

608
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:12,700
They say the construction was almost delayed because of the Hanwoo Beef Festival.

609
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,800
Chun Pil wished it would be delayed even more.

610
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,433
What?

611
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,233
So that he could see you for longer.

612
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:30,567
But he said he's sorry that he didn't consider your feelings might get hurt.

613
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:34,667
He said there are many other things he's sorry for.

614
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,533
Ah, it's home.

615
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:12,900
Finally, I'm in Seoul.

616
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:18,467
Now I can finally breathe.

617
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:23,600
Home is indeed the best.

618
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,633
Cheon Yeon Soo, do you know this feeling?

619
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:33,267
What am I saying right now?

620
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:35,800
Why am I suddenly talking about Cheon Yeon Soo?

621
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,667
Indeed, Arisu is the best when it comes to tap water.

622
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,633
It seems like my skin has become rough and dull because I didn't pay attention to it.

623
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,333
I shouldn't let it go like this.

624
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:31,567
Wow, it looks like my skin has improved.

625
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,267
Look at how firm it has become.

626
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:36,200
What if Cheon Yeon Soo doesn't recognize me?

627
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,533
I might have become so beautiful that he might not recognize me.

628
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,000
Why do I keep talking about Cheon Yeon Soo?

629
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,533
Oh no.

630
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:55,800
   

631
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,333
Will you throw it away?

632
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,200
Why did you come?

633
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,067
To clean.

634
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,967
- Kwon… 
 - Yes.

635
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:49,733
Please take this to Kang Hee's room…

636
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,133
Yes.

637
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,567
It's a call from Kang Hee.

638
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:25,467
Kang Hee, how's Seoul?

639
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,910
You're bored without me, aren't you?

640
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:32,533
Bored? I have a lot to do as well.

641
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:37,000
Like doing laundry and making calls.

642
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,667
What about you?

643
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:42,800
How are you doing? Are Yeon Soo and the others all doing well?

644
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,000
Ah, you miss me that much?

645
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,367
I'm in a good mood, so I'll hang up now.

646
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:55,233
 I'm also doing well… 

647
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,533
Hello?

648
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,100
Take a good rest in Seoul before you come back.

649
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,733
Yes.

650
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:12,533
Why?

651
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:13,833
Can't I just call without a reason?

652
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,533
Am I your lover or something? Hang up.

653
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,700
I'm swamped with work.

654
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,833
Oh, yeah, yeah.

655
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,800
- Yeah. 
 - I'll hang up first then.

656
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,333
I'll hang up now, bye.

657
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,267
Ah, okay.

658
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:35,200
Oh, I'm doing well. We should meet sometime, it's a pity.

659
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,267
Because I'm busy.

660
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:38,190
Sure, come visit sometime.

661
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,530
Yeah, okay.

662
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:41,933
Yeah, sorry.

663
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:44,833
Ah, I got a call from Kang Hee.

664
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,933
I told her to take a good rest while she's in Seoul and then come back.

665
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh, yeah. I see.

666
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:59,167
   

667
00:54:14,533 --> 00:54:18,467
So far, everything is progressing according to schedule without major issues.

668
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,567
Isn't this the first time a rooftop pool has been built in Hana-eup?

669
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,800
It's the first time, yes.

670
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,867
How about having the opening ceremony there?

671
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:32,600
The opening ceremony will of course be planned with a Christmas party concept.

672
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,567
It's also a request from the client.

673
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:35,833
Sounds good.

674
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:38,133
How is the Yeonnam-dong project progressing?

675
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:40,267
How about trying a rooftop pool there, too?

676
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:43,900
There is a cooling tower on the rooftop…

677
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,600
The load is an issue.

678
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,500
We'll know after a safety inspection.

679
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,133
 I will never forgive Mr. Chun Pil and your mother. 

680
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:56,067
 What about me? 

681
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:57,633
 You… 

682
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:03,500
 Can you abandon your mother? 

683
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Let's proceed that way. Thank you for your hard work.

684
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,367
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Yes.

685
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:15,800
Kang Hee.

686
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,167
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

687
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,233
Yes, Ms. Hwang.

688
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,367
Our meeting is over.

689
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:23,200
Yes.

690
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,900
Do you have any concerns?

691
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,867
Shall we have a cup of tea?

692
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:32,533
Next time, I have an appointment.

693
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,367
Kang Hee.

694
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,467
Has the meeting ended?

695
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:56,567
Yes.

696
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:58,320
Did you get a scolding from Ms. Hwang?

697
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,260
Why do you look upset?

698
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,800
Let's go, I'll cheer you up.

699
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:10,133
I really didn't expect that.

700
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,733
About what?

701
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:15,567
I had no idea Seok Kyeong would stay in the countryside that long.

702
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,533
He must be regretting it by now,

703
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:21,800
being bored with no work at the construction site.

704
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,567
Not really?

705
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:25,467
He seemed busy.

706
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:32,800
Because of the construction,

707
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,200
the dust is making the color of the wall start to change.

708
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,967
Start by cleaning the wall,

709
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:40,033
and then contact my secretary.

710
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:46,300
Look at how the floor in our store cracked because of the construction shaking the ground.

711
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,700
You have some spare tiles, don't you?

712
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,633
Start with a safety inspection of the building,

713
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:53,233
and please ask our site manager.

714
00:56:56,867 --> 00:57:00,733
Due to the construction noise, we have no customers at the restaurant.

715
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:02,450
I'll check if it tastes good

716
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,300
and then designate it as the on-site cafeteria. Okay?

717
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:11,400
You have your parents' permission, right?

718
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:17,467
I will choose my life partner myself.

719
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,567
Can you handle Ji Kang Hee?

720
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes, more than enough.

721
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,467
Is your taste in women the daughter of a motel owner?

722
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:29,700
The daughter of the shop in the next town is so pretty.

723
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,200
People are really visiting him day and night,

724
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,410
saying one of their distant relatives is much prettier than you

725
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,860
and even trying to set him up with matches.

726
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:44,333
Anyway, he said it's incredibly busy.

727
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:49,260
- It's very disconcerting. 
 - What is?

728
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:53,300
I'm amazed at how you know his latest updates in such detail.

729
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,967
Because we're friends.

730
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:00,633
We've been friends since we were in our mothers' wombs.

731
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,800
Friends…

732
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,267
Did you know that friendship is more persistent than love?

733
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:12,300
Because friendship is eternal.

734
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,467
Can we be friends?

735
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:02,467
   

736
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,867
Ji Kang Hee.

737
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:24,033
Do you know about the "white bear effect"?

738
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:27,033
They say, the more you try to forget, the more you keep thinking about it.

739
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:30,033
So let's just...

740
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:33,700
stay friends.

741
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:49,167
If you're going to eat, come on over.

742
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,733
Can't friends share ice cream?

743
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:44,750
Where's the spoon?

744
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,660
If you're going to eat, you need to bring a spoon.

745
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,667
Here it is.

746
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:54,900
What?

747
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,433
Can't friends even share a spoon?

748
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:00,430
That's not right!

749
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,567
Even as friends, you should use separate spoons.

750
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:04,667
Go get one quickly, if you're going to eat.

751
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:05,770
I don't want to.

752
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:08,000
It looks like you'll eat it all.

753
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,167
It's already all gone because you came late.

754
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,633
Look at this.

755
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:22,333
Can you be friends with me?

756
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,367
I don't want to.

757
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:44,700
♫  Close your eyes and feel me here  ♫

758
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:49,010
♫  What color is in your mind?  ♫

759
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:56,560
♫  Blue, dark gray, calm and sweet  ♫

760
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:02,490
♫  I can give you all  ♫

761
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:09,240
♫  Please tell me if you're standing here for me  ♫

762
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:15,650
♫  Far across the dream, just call my name  ♫

763
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:20,240
♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

764
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,040
♫  Here I am  ♫

765
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:29,060
♫  Where I stand  ♫

766
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:33,300
   

767
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:41,590


768
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:46,270
♫  Open wide your heart and see  ♫

769
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,940
♫  What colors are in your mind?r  ♫

770
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:59,020
♫  If you're afraid, I'll hold your hand  ♫

771
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,040
 - Can you be friends with me? 
 - I can. 

772
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,300
 How can a man and woman stay together forever? 

773
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,380
 I want to see if we can be friends. 

774
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,420
 Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. 

775
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,930
 If you're going to properly confess to Kang Hee... 

776
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:14,530
 I'm curious how things might have gone 

777
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,880
 if I had gone with you to Seoul. So let's try.
