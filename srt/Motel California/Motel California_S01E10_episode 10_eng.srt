1
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:28,130


2
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,420
Chun Pil, Chun Pil.

3
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,287
- Chun Pil. 
 - What?

4
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:50,270
You told me not to intervene because you would handle it.

5
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,780
But did you really tell them no?

6
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:56,353
Far from separating them, they disappeared together in the middle of the night.

7
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,430
I heard you've been meditating lately,

8
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,650
but what's wrong with you?

9
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,687
Relax.

10
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:08,220
Breathe like this. Take a deep breath.

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,153
Calm down. Take a breath.

12
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,820
One more.

13
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,353
   

14
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,920
Hey, Yeon Soo, where are you?

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,620
Huh?

16
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:33,953
Yeon Soo.

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,453
Yeon Soo, are you okay?

18
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,453
Are you okay?

19
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,320
Where's Kang Hee?

20
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,887
I'm really…

21
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:56,487
I'm sorry, sir.

22
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,620
Are you all right?

23
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,920
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,453
It's all my fault.

25
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,553
Because I foolishly suggested that we go to Seoul…

26
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,087
It'll be okay, don't worry.

27
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,187
It's okay.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,187
But why isn't she waking up?

29
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,687
They said there's nothing wrong.

30
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,820
 You… 

31
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,887
 You'll be punished by heaven, just like your mother. 

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,087
I was shocked, thinking that what I said became true.

33
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:54,100
Anyway, I really hate you.

34
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,320
Get up, quickly.

35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,553
Don't make everyone worry.

36
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,653
Oh my.

37
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,753
   

38
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,087
Kang Hee.

39
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:31,653
- You're here? 
 - Yes.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,810
   

41
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,187
What are you doing?

42
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:58,853
Being your guardian.

43
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,887
Just think of it as being hospitalized.

44
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:09,320
Wow, you are not telling me to leave.

45
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,853
It really seems like you're hurt.

46
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,420
I…

47
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,687
I think I saw Mom from there, just now.

48
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,953
The place where the accident happened just now…

49
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:29,653
That's the accident site, right?

50
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,187
Guess I'm right.

51
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:42,287
I remembered.

52
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:47,053
That day, I hid in Mr. Chun Pil's car.

53
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,920
From the car that was in the accident,

54
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,520
I saw Mom.

55
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,353
Oh dear.

56
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,953
Am I being punished?

57
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,753
What are you talking about? No.

58
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:07,753
Yeon Soo almost died because of me.

59
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:10,220
No, that's not true.

60
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,387
I heard everything from Yeon Soo.

61
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,453
Fortunately, you shouted

62
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:19,087
and thankfully avoided a head-on collision.

63
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:22,453
- Really? 
 - Yeah, it's true.

64
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:28,220
I think, somehow,

65
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:32,187
your mom is the one who saved you.

66
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,120
Dad.

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,687
Yes.

68
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,453
Why didn't you come then?

69
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,587
At that time, I had to go

70
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:53,553
because of a very, very important appointment…

71
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,220
An important appointment?

72
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Yes.

73
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,087
What's more important than Mom?

74
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,487
Sorry.

75
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:06,387
I was foolish.

76
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,853
Mom…

77
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,520
She looked young.

78
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,053
Mr. Chun Pil, you've gotten so old.

79
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:25,687
People say I look young wherever I go.

80
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:27,887
What nonsense are you talking about?

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,787
Only blind ladies would say that.

82
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:34,553
Mr. Chun Pil, you've aged.

83
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:39,253
Now, I can't hate you freely anymore.

84
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,820
So annoying.

85
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,053
This old man is leaving now.

86
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,553
Sleep now.

87
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:36,353
   

88
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:40,320
 Kang Hee, I wonder how far away Dad is? 

89
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,920
 Can't we go in and wait? 

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,320
 He will be here soon. 

91
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,553
  - Do you know what that money is? 
 - Let go, you punk. 

92
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,320
 I'm the victim. 

93
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,087
 That money is everything to my wife, and it's her dream. 

94
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,520
 Let go of this. 

95
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,587
 Hey! Won't you let go? 

96
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:05,287
 Give me the money! 

97
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,120
 Give it to me, you punk. 

98
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,920
 You! 

99
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,920
 Give me my money! 

100
00:08:56,387 --> 00:09:00,753
 Honey! Honey! 

101
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:01,753
 No, no. 

102
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:05,553
 Yeon Soo! Yeon Soo! 

103
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:08,653
 No, no. 

104
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:11,120
 No. 

105
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,687
 No, no. 

106
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,253
 I said no. 

107
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,653
 No! 

108
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:26,553
 Let's go. 

109
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:13,987
 Would you look at me, please? 

110
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,353
 Please, step aside. 

111
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,653
 We are passing through, please step aside. 

112
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,920
 It seems like they got hurt. 

113
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,287
 Excuse me, please step aside. 

114
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,853
 Please move back. 

115
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,387
 Please, step aside. 

116
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,487
 Are you okay? 

117
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:32,720
 The car slid on the snow-covered road. 

118
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,187
 I'll take a look. Hold on a moment. 

119
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,853
 I will try to stop the bleeding. 

120
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,687
 The door is open here, hurry. 

121
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,153
 We are passing through, please step aside. 

122
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:44,953
 - Cheon Yeon Soo. 
 - Yes? 

123
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,620
 Are you all right? 

124
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:52,920
 Where are you going? 

125
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,587
 You wait here. 

126
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,320
 Don't go, Kang Hee. 

127
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:02,053
 Don't go. Don't go. 

128
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:08,787
 Everyone, please handle this quickly. 

129
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:11,453
 Now, move quickly. 

130
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:19,687
 Are you okay? 

131
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,287
 Tell me if you are okay. 

132
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,553
 Would you look at me, please? 

133
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,587
- She went out. 
 - Huh?

134
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:05,953
She went out early in the morning.

135
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,820
Where to?

136
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,053
You should have stopped her, especially with her poor health.

137
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,020
Do you think I could stop her?

138
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,153
Kang Hee.

139
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,087
Ji Kang Hee.

140
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,053
Kang Hee.

141
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,320
Kang Hee.

142
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,320
Why were you here?

143
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,370
Are you feeling a bit better now?

144
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,750
I was worried about you.

145
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,520
Just…

146
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,553
I'm a bit confused.

147
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,887
You've been a bit frustrated, right?

148
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:53,753
Let's go inside anyway.

149
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,587
Let's go inside and rest.

150
00:14:56,453 --> 00:15:01,887
Have you ever looked for me around here?

151
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,490
Here?

152
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,320
I'm not sure if it's a childhood memory

153
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,287
or a dream,

154
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,387
but I think you were calling for me around here.

155
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:16,720
 - Kang Hee! 
 - Kang Hee! 

156
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,187
 Ji Kang Hee. 

157
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,287
You did, right?

158
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,620
I'm not sure.

159
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,053
When I come here, all I can think about is that…

160
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,120
About what?

161
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,153
You threw a tantrum for not doing number three.

162
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:36,153
Yeah, you were really persistent back then.

163
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:38,287
You remember too, right?

164
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,120
Of course.

165
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:45,253
Why?

166
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,753
Are you going to kiss me and run away again?

167
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:54,720
I'll stick to you like this.

168
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,287
It's warm.

169
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,587
Oh, did you bring this yourself?

170
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:15,420
Be careful, be careful.

171
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,353
The weather is getting cold, so the tiles might get hot or break easily.

172
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:25,220
Even though it's a hassle, please make sure to conduct a thorough inspection.

173
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,553
After all, you'll double-check it, won't you?

174
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:29,720
Still.

175
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,953
Please be careful even when removing flattening clips.

176
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:35,287
- I've already seen two cracked tiles. 
 - Got it, got it.

177
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,187
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Yes.

178
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:38,487
 Ms. Manager, please come this way! 

179
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,453
Yes, I'll get going.

180
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:40,887
Oh my, work hard.

181
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,320
- Yes. 
 - Here, here.

182
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,020
   

183
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,120
Where are you going?

184
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,853
I'm getting off work.

185
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:51,587
It's still the middle of the day.

186
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:52,753
Kang Hee said she finished working early.

187
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:53,820
Wow.

188
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,753
Are you always this honest?

189
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,587
It's not been that long since we broke up.

190
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:00,987
Sorry, but I can't lie about it.

191
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,387
Yes, yes.

192
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,853
Single old me will just have to feel sad.

193
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,853
Make sure to feed the donkey on time

194
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:08,287
and always refill its water.

195
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:10,853
Don't worry and go ahead.

196
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,220
Should I not answer this call?

197
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:21,020
This is Hana Veterinary Clinic.

198
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,687
Pardon? Director Cheon Yeon Soo?

199
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:27,353
Director, there's a lady here for you.

200
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:30,287
Yes, this is Cheon Yeon Soo.

201
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,420
Min Jung.

202
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:39,153
Yes, it's been a while.

203
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:41,553
Come quickly.

204
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:44,153
Hey, I had this before, and it was delicious.

205
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,087
It's addictive.

206
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:49,720
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - Thank you for the meal.

207
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,987
I should try putting it on my food, too.

208
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,753
That looks delicious.

209
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:08,653
It's delicious. This really goes well with chicken.

210
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:11,287
Should I give you some?

211
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,920
How is it?

212
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,320
It's tasty.

213
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,287
Do you really think it's delicious?

214
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:27,453
Try to describe it.

215
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,653
It's deliciously spicy.

216
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,387
Right? It's unique, isn't it?

217
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,553
Ah, sorry, sorry.

218
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:38,987
Welcome.

219
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,153
Why are you so late?

220
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,153
I was taking a call.

221
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,353
That looks delicious.

222
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,753
Thank you for the food.

223
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,120
It's Ah Reum's.

224
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,420
Hey, don't be stingy with the food.

225
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,020
Eat up, Yeon Soo.

226
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,820
All the legs here are yours.

227
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,600
When is Ah Reum coming?

228
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,720
She said she'd leave work early today.

229
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
Kang Hee, can you give Ah Reum a call?

230
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,187
You do it, I'm busy.

231
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,820
Should I give you some water?

232
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,453
- Is it good? 
 - It's so delicious.

233
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,620
What am I supposed to do if you come over so suddenly?

234
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,487
You should have at least contacted me before coming.

235
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,320
I know it's your library shift, so why would I contact you in advance?

236
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,587
Let's go, I'll buy you lunch at a fancy place.

237
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:23,287
I have plans with a friend; a lunch date.

238
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,987
Are friends that important in your life right now?

239
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:28,687
If you keep this up, I'm going to see another woman.

240
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,687
Please, go see another woman quickly.

241
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,320
No, even if you leave, let's talk at least.

242
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,220
- Get in. 
 - No, I don't want to.

243
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,420
Get in.

244
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,020
No.

245
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:47,420
Seung Eon.

246
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,220
- Are you going to go with him or get out? 
 - Who on earth are you?

247
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,953
She said she doesn't want to get in.

248
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,987
You…

249
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,620
Let's go.

250
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:11,553
He thinks being a doctor is some kind of official title.

251
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:15,620
Father insists on me getting married, and he's nagging me every day.

252
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,753
I thought I was the only one struggling, but you're not far behind.

253
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,287
Still, I'm better off.

254
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,353
I've always lived with my family.

255
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:26,853
Ah Reum.

256
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:30,153
Don't you want to just confront it head-on?

257
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:32,220
Yeon Soo and I did the same.

258
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,353
We also had fifty thousand reasons why we shouldn't date.

259
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:38,120
- Then, should I try convincing Mom first? 
 - Yes.

260
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,520
Still, my mom listens to what I have to say.

261
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Oh, Han Ah Reum.

262
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,653
It's really okay.

263
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:02,620
Mom, I wanted to introduce Seung Eon…

264
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:07,087
Do you think I have endured all this time just to end up like this?

265
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:10,120
Kang Hee, while you're seeing a hotel heir,

266
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,153
were you just standing by while Ah Reum was dating an orphan who does hard labor?

267
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:24,653
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:39,520
Mom, how can you say that?

269
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,153
You said that, Mom.

270
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:45,353
You said you hate people who hit others the most!

271
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:47,820
How can you be like this?

272
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,587
Next time, I'm going to hit him.

273
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:52,053
All of this is for you.

274
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:30,420
Don't do that in the future.

275
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,087
It just makes Ah Reum suffer.

276
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,587
You…

277
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,520
Do you want to go to Seoul with me?

278
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,553
- No. 
 - Why?

279
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:48,620
Because of Ah Reum?

280
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:55,753
His birth wasn't registered,

281
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:58,520
and only a note with his name and age was left.

282
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,953
Just leave him to an orphanage.

283
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,620
How can she abandon a child at a motel and leave?

284
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,520
Well…

285
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,587
In that letter…

286
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,987
The letter said they would come to find the child,

287
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:26,087
so would it be all right if I keep him for now?

288
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,787
Then, please go ahead and do that.

289
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
What's your name?

290
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,920
Cha Seung Eon.

291
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,420
From now on, you're my sibling.

292
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:44,253
Because my mom said she would come to get me.

293
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:46,520
I have to wait.

294
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,687
But I can't remember Mom's face.

295
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:56,020
I can't even go to look for her.

296
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,553
So, I can't leave here, Kang Hee.

297
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,320
You don't have a picture of your mom?

298
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:36,553
Your mom once said that I could call her 'mom.'

299
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,253
That's right.

300
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,653
My mom loved you more than me.

301
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,820
I remember this day.

302
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,953
It was the school entrance ceremony.

303
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:57,220
Even though it was the ceremony, Mom didn't come to school

304
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,153
and instead asked to take pictures in front of the house.

305
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:03,887
So I threw a tantrum and didn't take the picture.

306
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,520
I should've taken it.

307
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,420
I'll give it to you.

308
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,087
It's yours, isn't it?

309
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,753
My mom's photo…

310
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,987
Thank you for keeping it so long.

311
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,887
And I'm sorry, Seung Eon.

312
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,353
Good morning.

313
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:20,620
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yes.

314
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,987
You were going to Seoul without even saying goodbye to me, weren't you?

315
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:26,153
No, I was just about to go say goodbye now.

316
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:27,853
You were?

317
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:35,520
I didn't know the manager worked that much.

318
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,353
I was able to focus on the field thanks to the manager.

319
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:42,587
Tell me honestly.

320
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,253
Yes.

321
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:48,020
Did your heart waver even a little when you were proposed to?

322
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,920
Of course, it wavered.

323
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,587
My mental state was completely shattered.

324
00:26:54,587 --> 00:26:57,120
If you don't come quickly, I'll make a public proposal like that, too.

325
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,287
You think I'd be scared?

326
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,620
I'll make a public proposal to you, too.

327
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,520
To the whole world.

328
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:05,887
I'm sorry.

329
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,453
Manager,

330
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:15,287
do you know the orders for the sinks and sanitary ware are all wrong?

331
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,987
Then you do it again.

332
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:21,853
That's your work, so you handle it.

333
00:27:21,853 --> 00:27:23,487
There are hotel suppliers, right?

334
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:27,020
Call them all up and check for products that can meet the delivery schedule,

335
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,887
compare the specifications, make a list,

336
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:30,653
negotiate the prices, and place the orders.

337
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:34,753
Yes, do that, Ms. Kang Hee.

338
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,620
- If it's because of the proposal… 
 - Right, the proposal.

339
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:43,187
I did that, too.

340
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,420
Is it because of Esther, by any chance?

341
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:52,853
How do you know, Ms. Kang Hee?

342
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,953
How did you know, Manager?

343
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:57,620
Something seemed off about that guy, so I did a little investigation.

344
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,053
And it turns out she wasn't his cousin, but a woman he lived with.

345
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:02,570
Then, was it all because of that,

346
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,920
the silence and strange behavior when you came last time?

347
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,787
Is it not because I rejected your proposal?

348
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:12,253
What's the big deal about a proposal? I can just do that again.

349
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,320
You are not getting married right away either.

350
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,220
Esther's even pregnant.

351
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,120
But even if her father is such a bastard,

352
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,587
I can't just tell her to raise Little Heart without a father.

353
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,387
I can't say it because I'm afraid she might be shocked.

354
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:29,587
Esther already knows everything.

355
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:34,453
She was already shocked and saw it with her own eyes.

356
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:39,220
Is Esther okay?

357
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,187
Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo.

358
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,653
Is it you?

359
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:45,287
- It's you, right? 
 - What?

360
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:49,120
- Were you the one who talked to Min Jung? 
 - It wasn't me.

361
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,287
What do you mean it wasn't?

362
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,687
She called the hospital and found out my number.

363
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,120
It's Ms. Yoon.

364
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,320
Ms. Yoon, you took the call. Right?

365
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,220
Yes, well…

366
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,180
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:03,787
No, it's all right.

368
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,587
Would Ms. Yoon have answered the phone? Of course, it was me.

369
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,653
Jeez.

370
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:13,520
Why? What did Min Jung say?

371
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,653
She said she's coming.

372
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,320
Really? Why?

373
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,253
I don't know.

374
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:21,487
No, what if Min Jung asks me to try again

375
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,753
and go to Seoul together?

376
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:24,887
That won't happen.

377
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:27,520
How do you know her feelings?

378
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,053
- Yeon Soo, save me, please. 
 - What can I do?

379
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:35,853
If I go crazy and follow Min Jung to Seoul, hold me back.

380
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:39,253
Hearing you talk about Min Jung, I miss Kang Hee.

381
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:40,853
Kang Hee again?

382
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:43,020
Can't you focus on me?

383
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,287
Ms. Yoon, tomorrow…

384
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:48,753
If we're not busy, can I take a break?

385
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:52,187
Yes, there's nothing special tomorrow, yet.

386
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:53,853
Is that so?

387
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:57,753
Han Woo, you'll meet Min Jung and I'll go meet Kang Hee.

388
00:29:57,753 --> 00:29:59,253
Jeez, that disloyal punk.

389
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:00,587
You were the first to sever ties, you know?

390
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:02,253
Jeez, that grudge-holding punk.

391
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,920
If things go well with Min Jung and we meet again,

392
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,187
we can hang out together in Seoul, maybe a double date.

393
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,687
That piece of shit.

394
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,653
You said Min Jung came to see Han Woo?

395
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:14,920
Do you know her too? Min Jung?

396
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,220
Yeah, it's Han Woo's ex-girlfriend.

397
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,220
They dated on the premise of marriage, so I've seen her a few times, too.

398
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,753
Marriage…

399
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:29,720
Senior Han Woo… How was his life in Seoul?

400
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,387
Because it's unimaginable.

401
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:34,487
He was just exactly a finance guy.

402
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:38,687
I really couldn't imagine he'd leave everything and come back.

403
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:43,887
Then he must have made a really big decision to start the second act of his life.

404
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:48,520
Isn't it wrong to give up impulsively?

405
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,087
Try to stop him, Unnie.

406
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:55,187
No, how can I do that? Min Jung knows me, too.

407
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:59,753
I guess they'll talk it out and sort things well.

408
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:04,187
Still, should I give him a call

409
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:06,253
to check if he's doing well with her?

410
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,953
Hey, where are you?

411
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,120
   

412
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,920
Senior!

413
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,553
I heard Chil Ddaeng is sick.

414
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:49,253
What?

415
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:51,287
Don't go.

416
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:55,920
If you go to Seoul, who will take care of Chil Ddaeng?

417
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,253
Ms. Yoon, I'm not going.

418
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,120
Pardon?

419
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:11,487
Aren't you the veterinarian who performed surgery on Chil Ddaeng?

420
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:14,120
Oh, hello.

421
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,487
It's good to see you living well before I go.

422
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:19,787
Take care.

423
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:23,553
Congratulations on your marriage, sincerely.

424
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:26,153
I'll get going.

425
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,740
♫  The cold winter comes  ♫

426
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,360
♫  If your memory gets clearer   ♫

427
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,950
♫  It's snowing again  ♫

428
00:32:39,953 --> 00:32:42,720
Let's go, you said Chil Ddaeng is very sick.

429
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,100
Yes.

430
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,270
♫  The footsteps walking away from me  ♫

431
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:53,550
♫  Were erased, covered by snow  ♫

432
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:54,887
Oh, right.

433
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,520
Have you decided on a name for the donkey?

434
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,220
Not yet.

435
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,720
Do you have anything in mind?

436
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,953
Donkey, something like that?

437
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,053
- I'm sorry. 
 - Well…

438
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,387
But is it okay for you to come out so suddenly?

439
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,153
What about the hospital?

440
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:18,287
Yes, it's okay.

441
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,887
 I lost the doll. 

442
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:32,387
 The doll is missing. 

443
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:36,520
 The day my mother left… 

444
00:34:42,553 --> 00:34:44,553
 My doll. 

445
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:48,853
 Please find it for me. 

446
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,353
Are you already here?

447
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,020
Oh dear.

448
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,587
I'm sorry I'm not Kang Hee.

449
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,153
No, come in.

450
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,987
Why are you flustered?

451
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,053
No, I'm not.

452
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:17,220
Take a seat.

453
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:22,687
Oh dear.

454
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:30,887
You were quite hurt because I opposed you being together, weren't you?

455
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,053
Yes. A little bit.

456
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:37,153
Actually…

457
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:42,620
I opposed the two of you as Cheon Yeon Soo's father.

458
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,353
You've been through a lot, haven't you?

459
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,353
You should be happy.

460
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:52,420
You ought to live your life.

461
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,953
As for me,

462
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,020
I'm happy as long as Kang Hee is by my side.

463
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:03,787
Kang Hee is my life, after all.

464
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,053
Now, I'll talk to you as Kang Hee's father.

465
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:19,320
If it were up to me,

466
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:24,887
I'd ask you over and over...

467
00:36:26,487 --> 00:36:29,153
to take good care of Kang Hee.

468
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,687
Do you know how happy I was

469
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:38,753
when you said you would go meet Kang Hee...

470
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,920
instead of me last Christmas?

471
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,020
- Really? 
 - No, I'm lying.

472
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,820
Jeez.

473
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,287
Have I placed too much of a burden on you?

474
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:57,620
No, not at all. Never.

475
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,487
It seems like Kang Hee's memory is coming back.

476
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,387
Yes.

477
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:09,187
She even vaguely remembers fainting and losing consciousness as a child.

478
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,387
Thank you for being by her side.

479
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:33,220
I'll get going now.

480
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,187
All right.

481
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,120
- Get some rest. 
 - Yes.

482
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,387
Why is this rascal here, not even recognizing his master?

483
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:45,787
Why are you hitting him? I'm the owner.

484
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:50,087
Is it your son or your daughter?

485
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,087
Kang Hee.

486
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:34,553
Isn't she at home?

487
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:51,387
   

488
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:00,987
 Oh? Mom, you're awake. 

489
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,720
 Kang Hee, bring your clothes, too. 

490
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,553
 Okay. 

491
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,220
 Mom. 

492
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,320
 Here it is. 

493
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,520
 Mom, where are we going? 

494
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,687
 California. 

495
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,187
 This is California too, isn't it? 

496
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:24,787
 Not here, but where I grew up. 

497
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:26,187
 Is it far from here? 

498
00:39:26,187 --> 00:39:27,553
 It is far. 

499
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:29,553
 How far is it? 

500
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:31,687
 You'll find out when you get there. 

501
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:55,853
 Let's go in. 

502
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:21,287
 I love you, Kang Hee. 

503
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,153
 Mom. 

504
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,287
 - Kang Hee. 
 - Kang Hee. 

505
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:52,320
 - Ji Kang Hee. 
 - Ji Kang Hee. 

506
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,853
 Where did she go? 

507
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:57,720
 - Kang Hee. 
 - Kang Hee. 

508
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,920
 - Kang Hee. 
 - Ji Kang Hee. 

509
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,187
 Kang Hee. 

510
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,387
 Ji Kang Hee. 

511
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:04,553
 Ji Kang Hee. 

512
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,053
 Kang Hee. 

513
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,687
 She's here. I found Kang Hee. 

514
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:16,853
 Come quickly. 

515
00:43:16,853 --> 00:43:19,287
 Open your eyes. 

516
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:24,253
 Try opening your eyes. 

517
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,353
 Come quickly. 

518
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:30,553
 Kang Hee, open your eyes. 

519
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:33,653
 Please, try opening your eyes. 

520
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:45,553
 Mom. 

521
00:43:49,453 --> 00:43:52,653
 Mom, I'm sorry. 

522
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,220
Kang Hee.

523
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:30,930
Why are you so late?

524
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,580
It's cold, and you didn't answer your phone.

525
00:44:37,453 --> 00:44:39,653
Why did you come without saying anything?

526
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:42,287
I came out to pick you up.

527
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:46,387
I was worried, wondering if you got lost or if something had happened.

528
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,353
You just go first.

529
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:53,553
What about you?

530
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:55,520
Aren't you going?

531
00:45:00,587 --> 00:45:02,853
Should I sleep over then go?

532
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:09,387
Let's break up.

533
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,187
Let's break up now.

534
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,653
Are you not feeling well?

535
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:23,487
Just go.

536
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,620
Kang Hee.

537
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,487
Ji Kang Hee.

538
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,053
Look at me.

539
00:45:37,787 --> 00:45:40,920
I don't know what's going on

540
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,353
but if you need some time alone, I'll wait.

541
00:45:45,553 --> 00:45:48,553
When you want to talk about it later,

542
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,187
tell me then.

543
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,520
Don't struggle too long, Kang Hee.

544
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,120
You understand, right?

545
00:47:39,587 --> 00:47:42,120
- Everything's been taken care of. 
 - Yes.

546
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,987
Are you ready to be the ferry for the elderly

547
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:48,020
who cannot cross the river?

548
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,987
The ferry is ready.

549
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,087
- Is everything ready? 
 - Yes.

550
00:47:55,087 --> 00:48:00,487
Well, then… Let's become a walking cane for elders who can't walk.

551
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,687
Oh my, you look so pretty.

552
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:08,920
Did you put on makeup?

553
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,753
Why would I wear makeup when I'm not even dead?

554
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,487
No, I mean you look so lovely.

555
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:18,087
He said you look so pretty.

556
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:22,187
Are you telling me to die peacefully and be cremated nicely?

557
00:48:22,187 --> 00:48:25,987
How can you say that?

558
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,887
Take a picture of me, too.

559
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:42,453
- A funeral portrait? 
 - Yes.

560
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,253
It would be better to prepare it well in advance.

561
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:47,053
Why would you already prepare a funeral portrait?

562
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:50,553
No, it's a photo for Kang Hee to cherish for a long time,

563
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,287
so I have to take one while I'm at my best like this.

564
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:57,187
Today is the most splendid and wonderful day for me, isn't it?

565
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:01,053
You should take a really cool shot of me at this moment.

566
00:49:01,053 --> 00:49:02,887
Come on.

567
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:13,987
All right.

568
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:17,787
What are you waiting for? Quickly, take the picture!

569
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:19,887
One, two, three, Motel California!

570
00:49:19,887 --> 00:49:22,787
Yay, go for it!

571
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:26,987
What?

572
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:29,753
Does the photo look bad? Is something on me?

573
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:32,420
No.

574
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:38,053
You look your best today.

575
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:40,353
- I'll take it. 
 - Give it a shot, then.

576
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,720
One, two, three, ready.

577
00:49:44,653 --> 00:49:49,320
One, two, three.

578
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,153
Daughter, this is a song I've been practicing lately, listen.

579
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,853
Daughter.

580
00:51:17,653 --> 00:51:19,153
Sorry.

581
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:21,253
What for?

582
00:51:21,253 --> 00:51:23,020
Why are you sorry?

583
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,253
I…

584
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:30,853
I'm sorry for everything.

585
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:38,087
Mr. Chun Pil,

586
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:42,053
do you know what I can never forgive you for?

587
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,887
Why was I born?

588
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,620
Both you and Mom didn't want me. Right?

589
00:51:55,453 --> 00:51:57,953
That's really harsh.

590
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:04,887
Where in the world is there such a stupid question?

591
00:52:06,187 --> 00:52:08,420
Jeez.

592
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,587
I… hey, you…

593
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:13,190
It was back when indie bands

594
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,720
were really popular in Hongdae, that time.

595
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,153
Huh?

596
00:52:18,153 --> 00:52:23,687
I gave up all those bands I liked and came down to my hometown.

597
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:26,820
To go all in for you and Mom.

598
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:30,620
Wasn't it because you gave up studying for the civil service exam?

599
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,553
No, that's what people think.

600
00:52:33,553 --> 00:52:38,520
That kind of thing was not for me.

601
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,053
Then you should have gone all in for Mom.

602
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:49,653
So in my life, that was the biggest…

603
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:54,630
the biggest mistake.

604
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,587
Taking Mom away from you, that was all…

605
00:52:59,587 --> 00:53:03,187
So I'm really sorry about that.

606
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,653
I totally hate it.

607
00:53:07,987 --> 00:53:11,087
This soft and mushy atmosphere.

608
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,287
It feels like I need to forgive something, make amends,

609
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:17,553
and confess all my sins, this kind of atmosphere…

610
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:19,553
Don't force it.

611
00:53:20,387 --> 00:53:23,153
I love this kind of atmosphere.

612
00:53:23,153 --> 00:53:25,953
You are very spirited.

613
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,987
Until I accept the apology,

614
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:32,287
until I apologize,

615
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,253
live long and healthily.

616
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:42,853
I like it because you are always the same, my daughter.

617
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:56,687
Su Ji.

618
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:00,153
Su Ji.

619
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,287
Su Ji.

620
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:08,453
I'm here.

621
00:54:09,953 --> 00:54:12,753
Where have you been?

622
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:15,553
I was here in this flower garden.

623
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:20,220
Now, Su Ji, you can't be in the flower garden.

624
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,420
Oh, why not?

625
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:27,487
That's because I can't find you, Su Ji.

626
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:33,020
Can you really not tell the difference between me and a flower?

627
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,820
Oh, just a moment.

628
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,220
 Hello, it's Kang Hee. 

629
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,320
Gosh, you startled me.

630
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,787
Who was that on the phone that surprised you?

631
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:46,053
There's someone

632
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:50,953
I said something I shouldn't have to.

633
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:55,287
I should say sorry when we meet.

634
00:54:56,787 --> 00:55:00,153
I can't do that.

635
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,387
Why are you doing this?

636
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:44,353
I'm sorry, ma'am.

637
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:48,787
Is this…

638
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,953
a hidden camera prank?

639
00:55:50,953 --> 00:55:56,587
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable all this time.

640
00:55:58,087 --> 00:55:59,787
I sincerely apologize to you.

641
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:01,820
Apologize?

642
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,753
What on earth are you up to?

643
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:06,253
I want to leave.

644
00:56:06,253 --> 00:56:08,320
I'll leave.

645
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:10,953
The jujube tea here is tasty.

646
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:13,087
Please have some before you go.

647
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,053
Why is she acting like that?

648
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,320
You are here?

649
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:03,487
I have something to say.

650
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,487
Me too.

651
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,887
I also have something to say.

652
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,753
Shall we go down?

653
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:16,010
Yes.

654
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,087
- Yeon Soo, we… 
 - No.

655
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:36,653
I think I know what you're going to say, Kang Hee.

656
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,687
Don't say that.

657
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:42,153
Cheon Yeon Soo, you have to listen to me.

658
00:57:43,353 --> 00:57:46,253
From now on, the words I say…

659
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:48,220
I'll start first.

660
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:50,687
I'll start speaking first.

661
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:54,453
Honestly,

662
00:57:55,253 --> 00:57:58,487
I had a lot on my mind after leaving you alone in Seoul that day...

663
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,620
when you were struggling.

664
00:58:04,187 --> 00:58:07,220
I was thinking, "What if you say let's break up again,"

665
00:58:07,753 --> 00:58:11,020
"What if I'm told to wait more."

666
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,687
So I wondered if I should prepare myself.

667
00:58:16,787 --> 00:58:18,887
But you know what?

668
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,487
I had already put down roots in you.

669
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:28,170
If you hadn't been in my life,

670
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,780
it would have been as if I didn't exist either.

671
00:58:33,187 --> 00:58:35,987
My first goal in life was

672
00:58:35,987 --> 00:58:39,120
to become number one to you, Ji Kang Hee.

673
00:58:40,753 --> 00:58:43,087
And my first frustration was...

674
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,253
not being able to follow you to Seoul.

675
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,187
You were also the first woman who made me into a man,

676
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,853
and you were the first person I wanted to make happy.

677
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,887
So what I'm saying is…

678
00:59:10,187 --> 00:59:13,520
You're not just my first love to me,

679
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,820
but you're my everything, my beginning and end.

680
00:59:25,253 --> 00:59:27,520
I'm sorry for being too late.

681
00:59:32,053 --> 00:59:34,153
I love you.

682
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,153
I love you, Kang Hee.

683
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:50,953
You don't know when to use the words "I love you," do you?

684
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,553
After saying, "I love you",

685
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,053
my mom told me she loved me,

686
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,187
then took all my clothes out and was planning to run away.

687
01:00:07,753 --> 01:00:10,253
Together with your dad.

688
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:17,953
So, do you know what I did?

689
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:21,687
I stuffed a teddy bear...

690
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,087
inside the car's exhaust pipe.

691
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:30,987
What are you talking about?

692
01:00:30,987 --> 01:00:33,520
The car accident that day…

693
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,487
I caused it.

694
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:41,487
I killed my mom...

695
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:45,287
and your dad.

696
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:51,020
I'm the one who took your dad from you

697
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,287
and took Mr. Chun Pil's wife from him.

698
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,853
I am a murderer.

699
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,200
The words "I love you"...

700
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:17,387
are what people say when they are leaving.

701
01:01:19,253 --> 01:01:21,287
Yeon Soo.

702
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:27,220
So what I'm trying to say is…

703
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:33,520
Don't say it.

704
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:39,053
Please, don't say it.

705
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,720
I love you.

706
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,087
I love you, Yeon Soo.

707
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:19,010


708
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:30,387
♫  I realized it as I stared quietly into your eyes  ♫

709
01:02:30,387 --> 01:02:37,920
   

710
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:45,670
♫  My confession that never reached you  ♫

711
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:54,010
♫  Will a part of my sincerity reach you today?  ♫

712
01:02:54,010 --> 01:03:00,450
♫  My clumsy confession to you  ♫

713
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,130
 If you say it doesn't matter, will my sin disappear? 

714
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:06,830
 No matter how much you hide and avoid it, nothing will change.  

715
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,700
  There's something I have to tell you.  

716
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,210
  Thank you so much, Mom.  

717
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:13,890
  It's okay now, right?  

718
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,890
  Yeah, it's okay.  

719
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,150
  The results don't look good.  

720
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:18,280
  Are you sick?  

721
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,800
  Yeah, I am.  

722
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,860
  Tell me it's not because of me.  

723
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,290
  Nothing's going to happen.
