You told me not to intervene because you would
handle it. But did you really go against that?

Far from separating them, they disappeared
together in the middle of the night.

00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:34,620
Wow.

186
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,653
Are you always this honest?

187
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:39,387
You haven't broken up with me for long, right?

188
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:41,887
Sorry, but I can't lie about it.

189
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:43,287
Yes, yes.

190
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,653
I, without a boyfriend, feel really sad.

191
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:47,753
Make sure to feed the donkey on time

192
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,087
and always refill its water.

193
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,653
Don't worry and go ahead.

194
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Should I not answer this call?

195
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,920
This is Hana Veterinary Clinic.

196
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,487
Pardon? Director Cheon Yeon Soo?

197
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:08,053
Director, there's a lady here for you.

198
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,187
Yes, this is Cheon Yeon Soo.

199
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,420
Min Jung.

200
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,053
Yes, it's been a while.

201
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:22,353
Come quickly.

202
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:25,053
Hey, I had this before, and it was delicious.

203
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,987
It's addictive.

204
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:30,620
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

205
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,687
I should try sprinkling it on my food too.

206
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,653
That looks delicious.

207
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,653
It's delicious.

208
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:49,487
This really goes well with chicken.

209
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:52,287
Should I sprinkle this for you?

210
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,920
How is it?

211
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,120
It's tasty.

212
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,187
Do you really think it's delicious?

213
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,353
Try to describe it.

214
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,553
It's deliciously spicy.

215
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:13,387
Right? It's unique, isn't it?

216
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,353
Ah, sorry, sorry.

217
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:19,787
Welcome.

218
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,053
Why are you so late?

219
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,953
I was taking a call.

220
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:24,153
That looks delicious.

221
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,553
Thank you for the food.

222
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:28,020
It's Ah Reum's.

223
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,220
Hey, don't be stingy with the food.

224
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,920
Eat up, Yeon Soo.

225
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,720
All the legs here are yours.

226
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,620
When is Ah Reum coming? She
said she'd leave work early today.

227
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,020
Kang Hee, can you give Ah Reum a call?

228
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,087
You do it, I'm busy.

229
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,920
Should I give you some water?

230
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,353
- Is it good?
- It's so delicious.

231
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:53,520
What am I supposed to do if
you come over so suddenly?

232
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,287
You should have at least
contacted before coming.

233
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:58,120
I know it's your library shift, so why
would I contact you in advance?

234
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,187
Let's go, I'll buy you lunch at a fancy place.

235
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:04,087
I have plans with a friend, a lunch date.

236
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,787
Are friends that important
in your life right now?

237
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:09,487
If you keep this up, I'm going
to see another woman.

238
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:12,687
Please, go see another woman quickly.

239
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,020
No, even if you leave, let's talk at least.

240
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,120
- Get in.
- No, I don't want to.

241
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,220
Get in.

242
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,020
No.

243
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,120
Seung Eon.

244
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Are you getting in or out?

245
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,187
Who on earth are you?

246
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,653
She said she doesn't want to get in.

247
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,687
You…

248
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Let's go.

249
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,453
He thinks being a doctor
is some kind of official title.

250
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:56,420
Father insists on me getting
married, and he's nagging me every day.

251
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,553
I thought I was the only one
struggling, but you're not far behind.

252
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:03,187
Still, I'm better off.

253
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,153
I've always lived with my family.

254
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:08,053
Ah Reum.

255
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,053
Don't you want to just confront it head-on?

256
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:13,020
Yeon Soo and I did the same.

257
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,153
We also had fifty thousand
reasons why we shouldn't date.

258
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:18,320
Then, should I try convincing Mom first?

259
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,420
- Yes.
- Still, my mom listens to what I have to say.

260
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,320
Oh, Han Ah Reum.

261
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:34,553
It's really okay.

262
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,687
It's really okay.

263
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:43,320
Mom, I wanted to introduce Seung Eon…

264
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:47,887
Do you think I have endured all
this time just to end up like this?

265
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:50,720
Kang Hee, while you're seeing a hotel heir…

266
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,753
Were you just standing by while Ah Reum
is dating an orphan who does hard labor?

267
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,653
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:20,420
Mom, how can you say that?

269
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,953
You said that, Mom.

270
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:26,253
You said you hate people
who hit others the most!

271
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:28,620
How can you be like this?

272
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,387
Next time, I'm going to hit him.

273
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:32,853
All of this is for you.

274
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:11,320
Don't do that in the future.

275
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,087
Only Ah Reum is having a hard time.

276
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,687
You…

277
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,320
Do you want to go to Seoul with me?

278
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,553
No.

279
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,387
Why?

280
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,420
Because of Ah Reum?

281
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,553
His birth wasn't registered,

282
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:39,620
and only a note with his name and age was left.

283
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:43,053
Just leave him to an orphanage.

284
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:46,520
How can she abandon a
child at a motel and leave?

285
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,620
Well…

286
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:56,587
In that letter…

287
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,887
The letter said they would
come to find the child,

288
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:07,087
so would it be alright if I keep him for now?

289
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,787
Then, please go ahead and do that.

290
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,920
What's your name?

291
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,720
Cha Seung Eon.

292
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,420
From now on, you're my sibling.

293
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:25,053
Because my mom said she would come to get me.

294
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,320
I have to wait.

295
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,487
But I can't remember Mom's face.

296
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:36,720
I can't even go to look for her.

297
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,353
So, I can't leave here, Kang Hee.

298
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,420
You don't have a picture of your mom?

299
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:17,653
Your mom once said that I could call her 'mom.'

300
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,353
That's right.

301
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,553
My mom loved you more than me.

302
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:32,620
I remember this day.

303
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,753
It was the entrance ceremony.

304
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:38,020
Even though it was the ceremony,
Mom didn't come to school

305
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,053
and instead asked to take
pictures in front of the house.

306
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,887
So I threw a tantrum and
didn't take the picture.

307
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,520
I should've taken it.

308
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:56,420
I'll give it to you.

309
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,987
It's yours, isn't it?

310
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,653
My mom's photo…

311
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,087
Thank you for keeping it so long.

312
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,687
And I'm sorry, Seung Eon.

313
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,253
Good morning.

314
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,520
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

315
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,887
You were going to Seoul without even
saying goodbye to me, weren't you?

316
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:07,053
No, I was just about to go say goodbye now.

317
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,953
You were?

318
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:16,420
I didn't know the manager worked that much.

319
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:21,153
I was able to focus on the field
thanks to the manager.

320
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:23,487
Tell me honestly.

321
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:25,053
Yes.

322
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:28,720
Did your heart waver even a little
when you were proposed to?

323
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,920
Of course, it wavered.

324
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,787
My mental state was

325
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:35,487
completely shattered.

326
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:37,920
If you don't come quickly, I'll make
a public proposal like that too.

327
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,087
You think I'd be scared?

328
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:42,420
I'll make a public proposal to you too.

329
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,520
To the whole world.

330
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,087
I'm sorry.

331
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,253
Manager.

332
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:56,087
Do you know the order for the sinks
and sanitary ware is all wrong?

333
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,687
Then you do it again.

334
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,653
That's your work, so you handle it.

335
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,287
There are hotel suppliers, right?

336
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:07,820
Call them all up and check for products
that can meet the delivery schedule,

337
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,687
compare the specifications, make a list,

338
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:11,453
negotiate the prices, and place the orders.

339
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:15,653
Yes, do that, Ms. Kang Hee.

340
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,520
If it's because of the proposal…

341
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,687
Right, the proposal.

342
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,987
I did that, too.

343
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,220
Is it because of Esther, by any chance?

344
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:33,653
How do you know, Ms. Kang Hee?

345
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,853
How did you know, manager?

346
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:38,320
Something seemed off about that
guy, so I did a little investigation.

347
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,853
And it turns out she wasn't his
cousin, but a woman he lived with.

348
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:47,820
Then, was it all because of that, the silence
and strange behavior when you came last time?

349
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,487
Is it not because I rejected your proposal?

350
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:53,153
What's the big deal about
a proposal? I can just do that again.

351
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:56,020
You are not getting married right away either.

352
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
Esther even had a baby,

353
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,920
but because her father is such a punk,

354
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,487
I can't just say let's raise
Little Heart without a father.

355
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:08,187
I can't say it because I'm
afraid she might be shocked.

356
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,487
Esther already knows everything.

357
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,553
She was already shocked

358
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:15,253
and saw it with her own eyes.

359
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:19,520
Is Esther okay?

360
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:22,287
Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo.

361
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,453
Is it you?

362
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,587
It's you, right?

363
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:28,820
- What?
- Were you the one who talked to Min Jung?

364
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,087
- It wasn't me.
- What do you mean it wasn't?

365
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:33,587
She called the hospital
and found out my number.

366
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,920
It's Ms. Yoon.

367
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,220
Ms. Yoon, you received it, right?

368
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,087
Yes, well… I'm sorry.

369
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,787
No, it's alright.

370
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,387
Would Ms. Yoon have answered
the phone? Of course, it was me.

371
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:52,453
Jeez.

372
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,320
Why? What did Ms. Min Jung say?

373
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,453
She said she's coming.

374
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:57,120
Really? Why?

375
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,053
I don't know.

376
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:02,287
No, what if Min Jung asks me to try again

377
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,553
and go to Seoul together?

378
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:05,587
That won't happen.

379
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:08,320
How do you know her feelings?

380
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,053
Yeon Soo, save me, please.

381
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,053
What can I do?

382
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:16,653
If I go crazy and follow Min Jung
to Seoul, hold me back.

383
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,853
Since you talk about Ms. Min Jung,

384
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:20,053
I miss Kang Hee.

385
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:21,653
Kang Hee again?

386
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,820
Can't you focus on me?

387
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,087
Ms. Yoon, tomorrow…

388
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:30,053
If you're not busy, can I take a break?

389
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:32,987
Yes, there's nothing special tomorrow, yet.

390
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,753
Is that so?

391
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:38,453
Han Woo, you'll meet Min Jung,
and I'll go meet Kang Hee.

392
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:40,053
Jeez, that disloyal punk.

393
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,387
You were the first to sever ties, you know?

394
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,053
Jeez, that grudge-holding punk.

395
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:45,720
If things go well with Min Jung
and we meet again,

396
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,987
we can hang out together in
Seoul, maybe a double date.

397
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,487
Trashy brat.

398
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,553
Did Ms. Min Jung come to see Han Woo?

399
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,620
Do you know her too? The one called Min Jung?

400
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,020
Yeah, it's Han Woo's ex-girlfriend.

401
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,220
They dated on the premise of marriage,
so I've seen her a few times too.

402
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:05,653
Marriage…

403
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:10,520
Senior Han Woo… How was his life in Seoul?

404
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,187
Because it's unimaginable.

405
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,287
He was just exactly a finance guy.

406
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:19,487
I really couldn't imagine he'd
leave everything and come back.

407
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:24,687
Then he must have made a really big
decision to start the second act of his life.

408
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:28,920
Isn't it wrong to give up impulsively?

409
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:30,887
Try to stop him, Ah Reum.

410
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:35,987
No, how can I do that? Min Jung knows me too.

411
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:40,653
I guess they'll talk it out
and sort things well.

412
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:44,887
Still, should I give him a call

413
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,153
to check if he's doing well with her?

414
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,953
Hey, where are you?

415
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,920
Senior.

416
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,353
I heard Chil Ddaeng is sick.

417
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,053
What?

418
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,087
Don't go.

419
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:36,720
If you go to Seoul, who will
take care of Chil Ddaeng?

420
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,053
Ms. Yoon, I'm not going.

421
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:44,920
Pardon?

422
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:52,287
Aren't you the veterinarian who
performed surgery on Chil Ddaeng?

423
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,920
Oh, hello.

424
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,287
It's good to see you living well before I go.

425
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:00,487
Take care.

426
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:04,353
Congratulations on your marriage, sincerely.

427
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,953
I'll get going.

428
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:23,520
Let's go, you said Chil Ddaeng is very sick.

429
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,387
Yes.

430
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,687
Oh, right.

431
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,320
Have you decided on a name for the donkey?

432
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,020
Not yet.

433
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,520
Do you have anything in mind?

434
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:49,753
Donkey, something like that?

435
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:51,853
- I'm sorry.
- Well…

436
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:54,187
But is it okay for you to come out so suddenly?

437
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:55,553
What about the hospital?

438
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:59,087
Yes, it's okay.

439
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,687
<i>I lost the doll.</i>

440
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:13,187
<i>The doll is missing.</i>

441
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,320
<i>The day my mother left…</i>

442
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,353
<i>My doll.</i>

443
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:29,653
<i>Please find it for me.</i>

444
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,153
Are you already here?

445
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:45,820
Oh dear.

446
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,387
I'm sorry I'm not Kang Hee.

447
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,953
No, come in.

448
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:52,787
Why are you flustered?

449
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:54,853
No, I'm not.

450
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,020
Take a seat.

451
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:03,487
Oh dear.

452
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:11,687
You were quite hurt because
I was opposed it, weren't you?

453
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,253
Yes.

454
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:15,753
A little bit.

455
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:17,953
Actually…

456
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:23,420
I opposed the two of you
as Cheon Yeon Soo's father.

457
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,153
You've been through a lot, haven't you?

458
00:35:26,153 --> 00:35:29,153
You should be happy.

459
00:35:29,153 --> 00:35:33,220
You ought to live your life.

460
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,753
As for me,

461
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,820
I'm happy as long as Kang Hee is by my side.

462
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:44,587
Kang Hee is my life, after all.

463
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,953
Now, I'll

464
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:56,120
talk to you as Kang Hee's father.

465
00:35:57,187 --> 00:36:00,120
If it were up to me,

466
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:05,687
I'd ask you over and over

467
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:09,953
to take good care of Kang Hee.

468
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,487
Do you know how happy I was

469
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:19,553
when you said you would go meet Kang Hee

470
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,720
instead of me last Christmas?

471
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,820
- Really?
- No, I'm lying.

472
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,620
Jeez.

473
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,087
Have I placed too much of a burden on you?

474
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:38,420
No, not at all. Never.

475
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,287
It seems like Kang Hee's
memory was coming back.

476
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,187
Yes.

477
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:49,987
She even vaguely remembers fainting
and losing consciousness as a child.

478
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,987
Thank you

479
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:01,587
for being by her side.

480
00:37:11,953 --> 00:37:14,020
I'll get going now.

481
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,987
Alright.

482
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,920
- Take a rest.
- Yes.

483
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,187
Why is this rascal here, not
even recognizing his master?

484
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,587
Why are you hitting him? I'm the owner.

485
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,487
Is it your son, or your daughter?

486
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,887
Kang Hee.

487
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:15,353
Isn't she at home?

488
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:32,187
<i>[Deceased Mia Kim Tyler]</i>

489
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:41,787
<i>Oh? Mom, you're awake.</i>

490
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,520
<i>Kang Hee, bring your clothes too.</i>

491
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,353
<i>Okay.</i>

492
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,020
<i>Mom.</i>

493
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,120
<i>Here it is.</i>

494
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,320
<i>Mom, where are we going?</i>

495
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,487
<i>California.</i>

496
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:02,987
<i>This is California too, isn't it?</i>

497
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:05,587
<i>Not here, but where I grew up.</i>

498
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:06,987
<i>Is it far from here?</i>

499
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:08,353
<i>It is far.</i>

500
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:10,353
<i>How far is it?</i>

501
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:12,487
<i>You'll find out when you get there.</i>

502
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:36,653
<i>Let's go in.</i>

503
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:02,087
<i>I love you, Kang Hee.</i>

504
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,953
<i>Mom.</i>

505
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,087
<i>- Kang Hee.
- Kang Hee.</i>

506
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:33,120
<i>- Ji Kang Hee.
- Ji Kang Hee.</i>

507
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,653
Where did she go?

508
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,753
<i>- Kang Hee.
- Kang Hee.</i>

509
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:38,620
<i>- Kang Hee.
- Kang Hee.</i>

510
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,720
<i>- Kang Hee.
- Ji Kang Hee.</i>

511
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,987
<i>Kang Hee.</i>

512
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,187
<i>Ji Kang Hee.</i>

513
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,353
<i>Ji Kang Hee.</i>

514
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,853
<i>Kang Hee.</i>

515
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,487
<i>She's here. I found Kang Hee.</i>

516
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:57,653
<i>Come quickly.</i>

517
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:00,087
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

518
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:05,053
<i>Try opening your eyes.</i>

519
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:07,153
<i>Come quickly.</i>

520
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:11,353
<i>Kang Hee, open your eyes.</i>

521
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:14,453
<i>Please, try opening your eyes.</i>

522
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:26,353
<i>Mom.</i>

523
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:33,453
<i>Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

524
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,020
Kang Hee.

525
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:14,387
Why are you here now? It's cold,
and you didn't answer your phone.

526
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:20,453
Why did you come without saying anything?

527
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:23,087
I came out to pick you up.

528
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:27,187
I was worried, wondering if our paths
had crossed or if something had happened.

529
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,153
You just go first.

530
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,353
What about you?

531
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:36,320
Aren't you going?

532
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,653
Should I sleep over then go?

533
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,187
Let's break up.

534
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,987
Let's break up now.

535
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:02,453
Are you not feeling well?

536
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:04,287
Just go.

537
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,320
Kang Hee.

538
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,287
Ji Kang Hee.

539
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:13,853
Look at me.

540
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:21,720
I don't know what's going on

541
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,153
but if you need some time alone, I'll wait.

542
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:29,353
When you want to talk about it later,

543
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,987
tell me then.

544
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,320
Don't struggle too long, Kang Hee.

545
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,920
You understand, right?

546
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:22,920
- Everything's been taken care of.
- Yes.

547
00:47:23,453 --> 00:47:26,887
Are you ready to be the ferry for the elderly

548
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,820
who cannot cross the river?

549
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,787
The ferry is ready.

550
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,387
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

551
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:36,587
Well, then…

552
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:41,353
Let's become a walking cane
for elders who can't walk.

553
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,487
Oh my, you look so pretty.

554
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:49,720
Did you put on makeup?

555
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,553
Why would I wear makeup when I'm not even dead?

556
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,287
No, I mean you look so lovely.

557
00:47:57,287 --> 00:47:58,887
He said you look so pretty.

558
00:47:58,887 --> 00:48:02,987
Are you telling me to die peacefully
and be cremated nicely?

559
00:48:02,987 --> 00:48:06,587
How can you say that?

560
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,687
Take a picture of me too.

561
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:23,253
- A funeral portrait?
- Yes.

562
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:25,053
It would be better to
prepare it well in advance.

563
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:27,853
Why would you already
prepare a funeral portrait?

564
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:31,353
No, it's a photo for Kang Hee
to cherish for a long time,

565
00:48:31,353 --> 00:48:34,087
so I have to take one while
I'm at my best like this.

566
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:37,987
Today is the most splendid and
wonderful day for me, isn't it?

567
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:41,853
You should take a really cool
shot of me at this moment.

568
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:43,687
Come on.

569
00:48:52,853 --> 00:48:54,787
Alright.

570
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,387
What are you waiting for?

571
00:48:57,387 --> 00:48:58,520
Quick, take a picture!

572
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,687
One, two, three, Motel California!

573
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,587
Yay, go for it!

574
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,587
What?

575
00:49:07,587 --> 00:49:10,553
Does the photo look bad? Is something on me?

576
00:49:11,387 --> 00:49:13,220
No.

577
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,853
You look your best today.

578
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:21,153
- I'll take it.
- Give it a shot, then.

579
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:23,520
One, two, three, ready.

580
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:30,120
One, two, three.

Daughter.

596
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,053
Sorry.

597
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,153
What for?

598
00:51:32,153 --> 00:51:33,920
Why are you sorry?

599
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,153
I…

600
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:41,753
I'm sorry for everything.

601
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:48,987
Mr. Chun Pil,

602
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,953
do you know what I can never forgive you?

603
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,787
Why was I born?

604
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,420
Both you and Mom

605
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,787
didn't want me, right?

606
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:08,853
That's really harsh.

607
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:15,787
Where in the world is there
such a stupid question?

608
00:52:17,087 --> 00:52:20,020
Jeez.

609
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,487
I… hey, you…

610
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:27,620
It was back when indie bands were really
popular in front of Hongdae, that time.

611
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,053
Huh?

612
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:34,587
I gave up all those bands I liked
and came down to my hometown.

613
00:52:34,587 --> 00:52:37,720
To go all in for you and Mom.

614
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:41,520
Wasn't it because you gave up
studying for the civil service exam?

615
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,453
No, that's what people think.

616
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:49,420
That kind of thing was not for me.

617
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,953
Then you should have gone all in for Mom.

618
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,553
So in my life, that was the biggest…

619
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:06,220
The biggest mistake.

620
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,487
Taking Mom away from you, that was all…

621
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,087
So I'm really sorry about that.

622
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,553
I totally hate it.

623
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:22,087
This soft and mushy atmosphere.

624
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:25,187
It feels like I need to forgive
something, make amends,

625
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:28,453
and confess all my sins,
this kind of atmosphere…

626
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:30,453
Don't force it.

627
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:34,053
I love this kind of atmosphere.

628
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:36,853
You are very spirited.

629
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:39,887
Until I accept the apology,

630
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:43,187
until I apologize,

631
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:48,153
live long and healthily.

632
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:53,753
I like it because you are always
the same, my daughter.

633
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:07,587
Su Ji.

634
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,853
Su Ji.

635
00:54:10,853 --> 00:54:14,187
Su Ji.

636
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,553
I'm here.

637
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:20,387
Oh.

638
00:54:20,853 --> 00:54:23,653
Where have you been?

639
00:54:24,187 --> 00:54:26,453
I was here in this flower garden.

640
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:31,120
Now, Su Ji, you can't be in the flower garden.

641
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,320
Oh, why not?

642
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,387
That's because I can't find you, Su Ji.

643
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:43,920
Can you really not tell the difference
between me and a flower?

644
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,720
Oh, just a moment.

645
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,120
<i>Hello, it's Kang Hee.</i>

646
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,220
Gosh, you startled me.

647
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,687
Who was that on the phone that surprised you?

648
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:56,953
There's someone

649
00:54:56,953 --> 00:55:01,853
I said something I shouldn't have to.

650
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:06,187
I should say sorry when we meet.

651
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:11,053
I can't do that.

652
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,287
Why are you doing this?

653
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:55,253
I'm sorry, ma'am.

654
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,687
Is this…

655
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,853
Why are you doing this to me?

656
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:07,487
I'm sorry for making you
uncomfortable all this time.

657
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:10,687
I sincerely apologize to you.

658
00:56:10,687 --> 00:56:12,720
Apologize?

659
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,653
What on earth are you up to?

660
00:56:15,653 --> 00:56:17,153
I just want to leave.

661
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:19,220
I'll get going.

662
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:21,853
The jujube tea here is tasty.

663
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:23,987
Please have some before you go.

664
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,953
Why is she acting like that?

665
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,220
You are here?

666
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,387
I have something to say.

667
00:57:15,487 --> 00:57:17,387
Me too.

668
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,787
I also have something to say.

669
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,653
Shall we go down?

670
00:57:25,387 --> 00:57:27,420
Yes.

671
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,387
Yeon Soo, we…

672
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:43,887
No.

673
00:57:43,887 --> 00:57:47,553
I think I know what you're
going to say, Kang Hee.

674
00:57:47,553 --> 00:57:48,587
Don't say that.

675
00:57:48,587 --> 00:57:50,853
Cheon Yeon Soo.

676
00:57:50,853 --> 00:57:53,153
You have to listen to me.

677
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:57,153
From now on, the words I say…

678
00:57:57,153 --> 00:57:59,120
I'll start first.

679
00:57:59,587 --> 00:58:01,587
I'll start speaking first.

680
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:05,353
Honestly,

681
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:09,387
I had a lot on my mind after leaving
you alone in Seoul that day

682
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,520
when you were struggling.

683
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:18,120
I was thinking, 'What if you
say let's break up again,'

684
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:21,920
'What if I'm told to wait more.'

685
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,587
So I wondered if I should prepare myself.

686
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:29,787
But you know what?

687
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,387
I had already put down roots in you.

688
00:58:36,653 --> 00:58:41,687
If you hadn't been in my life, it would
have been as if I didn't exist either.

689
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,887
My first goal in life was

690
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:50,020
to become number one to you, Ji Kang Hee.

691
00:58:51,753 --> 00:58:53,987
And my first frustration was

692
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,153
not being able to follow you to Seoul.

693
00:59:02,553 --> 00:59:06,087
You were also the first woman
who made me into a man,

694
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,753
and you were the first person
I wanted to make happy.

695
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,787
So what I'm saying is…

696
00:59:21,087 --> 00:59:24,420
You're not just my first love to me,

697
00:59:28,053 --> 00:59:30,720
but you're my everything, my beginning and end.

698
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:38,420
I'm sorry for being too late.

699
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:45,053
I love you.

700
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,053
I love you, Kang Hee.

701
00:59:56,187 --> 00:59:58,553
You don't know

702
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,020
when to use the words 'I love you', do you?

703
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,453
After saying, 'I love you.'

704
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,953
My mom told me she loved me,

705
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,087
then took all my clothes out
and was planning to run away.

706
01:00:18,653 --> 01:00:21,153
Together with your dad.

707
01:00:25,953 --> 01:00:28,853
So, do you know what I did?

708
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:32,587
I stuffed a teddy bear

709
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,987
inside the car's exhaust pipe.

710
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,887
What are you talking about?

711
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:44,420
The car accident that day…

712
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,387
I caused it.

713
01:00:49,553 --> 01:00:52,387
I killed my mom,

714
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:56,187
and your dad.

715
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:01,920
I'm the one who took your dad from you

716
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,187
and took his wife from Mr. Chun Pil.

717
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,753
I am a murderer.

718
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,100
The words 'I love you'

719
01:01:25,753 --> 01:01:28,287
