1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
You shouldn't do this, stop it.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,767
Let go!

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,967
Jeez, go back.

4
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,267
Cheon Yeon Soo.

5
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,500
Move aside, I have something
to say to Cheon Yeon Soo.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,033
At this point, what do you
even have to say to him?

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,667
It's too late, Kang Hee.

8
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,533
Doing this will only make Yeon Soo suffer.

9
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,367
Just a moment.

10
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,700
Yeon Soo.

11
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:37,900
Yeon Soo.

12
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,433
How long have you been together
that you're already getting married?

13
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,067
Are you sure you know what you're getting into?

14
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,700
Aren't you just being charmed by a vixen?

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,233
Don't speak recklessly.

16
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,633
What?

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,367
You said you'd only wait for me.

18
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,000
You said you only liked me!

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,867
First love, the end.

20
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:57,167
This is what you said.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,867
You're now a woman of the past to me.

22
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,300
Goodbye, Ji Kang Hee.

24
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:10,933

25
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,867
Cheon Yeon Soo.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,867
Yeon Soo.

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,767
Cheon Yeon Soo!

28
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeon Soo.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,133
He's just like his name, Cheon Yeon Soo.

30
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,833
He's completely innocent.

31
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:36,200
He has a house and a hospital, so
I should take my share and leave.

32
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:39,533
Wait a bit, sweetheart.

33
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,700
What on Earth did you do to Yeon Soo?

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,467
Let me see your face first.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
No, you can't.

36
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,033
Hey, hey, Kang Hee!

37
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,133
No, you can't.

38
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:50,967
Hey!

39
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,500
Let go. What's wrong with you?

40
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,867
What kind of dream did you have?
Why are you doing this to me?

42
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,600
- Ah Reum.
- Yes.

43
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:10,933
By any chance, what do you think would happen

44
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,700
if I went back to Hana-eup

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,667
and worked there?

46
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,167
You had a nightmare, right?

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,733
The dream of returning to Hana-eup.

48
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,667
Don't be scared. You haven't
done anything wrong.

49
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,300
That's something of the past.

50
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,867
And both you and Yeon Soo have found
your own partners, so what will happen?

51
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,167
Don't worry and come.

52
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,000
No, that won't happen.

53
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,967
Hana-eup doesn't have
a hotel or a shopping mall.

54
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,400
I won't go back.

55
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,867
I'll go.

56
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,400
- Where to?
- To Hana-eup.

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
I said I'll go.

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,767
The CEO has already left.

59
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,967
- Room 7112.
- Over there, over there.

60
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,633
Are you…

61
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,300
Are you okay?

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,100
How badly are you hurt?

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
As you can see, I'm alive.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,633
The car's almost scrap, so
I'm just glad it's still this good.

65
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,600
Does a left turn without
protection even make sense?

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Why would they create a signal
that doesn't even provide protection?

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,067
You should have been careful.

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,267
Shall I call someone?

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,733
No, no.

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,533
I'm fine.

71
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,200
What should we do about the Hana-eup case?

72
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,100
The weather is getting colder.

73
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,067
We can't postpone the
construction until my leg heals.

74
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,267
The incentive.

75
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,800
It's double, right?

76
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:47,767
Are you going to handle the work for me?

77
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,300
I can change the design, right?

78
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,767
Are you going to do that as well?

79
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,000
We'll have to reschedule the meeting.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,267
Since Director Geum knows all about
the site progress, you two go together.

81
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:00,433
- Pardon?
- Yes, sir.

82
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,167
Are you going on a cruise or something?

83
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,167
Are you the one heading to
the prosecutor's office photo line?

84
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,567
If you go to the site like that,
you'll ruin your clothes.

85
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,933
What's the use in saving clothes
that I'll throw away after the season?

86
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,200
If you buy things like this
instead of those, that's wasteful.

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,500
There's one condition if we go together.

Why?

91
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,400
You've never lived in the countryside, right?

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
I know from experience, there
are really a lot of people talking.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,367
They complain about the construction
noise being too loud,

94
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,067
say they'll bring the whole
family to introduce them,

95
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:03,200
and come over anytime, day or night,
without notice. It's really a headache.

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
- Deal.
- For the same reasons,

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,733
if we run into someone at a restaurant, it's
tiring, so let's have everything delivered.

98
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,800
Okay.

99
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,367
And this is the most important thing.

100
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,100
Is there more?

101
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,567

If I don't call you Ji Kang Hee,
what should I call you?

00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,267
We've met through work.

titles in the company, right?

00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,633
Oh, you care about that sort of thing.

107
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,567
Got it, Assistant Manager Ji.

108
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't call me that either.

You know this neighborhood well.

124
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,333
I saw it on the map.

125
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,033
On the map.

126
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,033
Are you going to have the client
meeting at the construction site?

127
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,733
That's not it, but…

128
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,333
But why here of all places?

129
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,767
Because the owner here is the client.

- Excuse me?
- Bring all the blueprints with you.

136
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,167
We will proceed as soon as she recovers,

137
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:18,233
so you two should go back now.

138
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,167
Ms. Manager here is our company's ace,

139
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,800
the one that Ms. Hwang trusts
and believes in the most.

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
My father also runs a motel,

141
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,367
so I'm confident that I know what
you want better than anyone.

142
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,933
Yeah?

143
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,467
Where does he run a motel?

144
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,300
He passed away when she was ten.

145
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,367
I see.

146
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,767
Then…

147
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,233
Then, shall I hear how well

148
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,800
you know what I want?

149
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:08,800
Our company pursues a
remodeling franchise business

150
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,967
that views motels as cultural spaces.

151
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,567
Simply put,

152
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:16,133
it's about branding motels like hotels.

153
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,900
<i>[Motel]</i>

154
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,167
<i>[Hotel]</i>

155
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,567
Do you see the difference between the two?

156
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,933
Let me eliminate this difference.

157
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,667
Ta-da.

158
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:46,333
This "Otel," which eliminates the difference
between a motel and a hotel,

159
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,733
is our brand.

160
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,500
So, it's not "Motel Boomerang,"

161
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,867
but "Otel Hana" instead.

162
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,967
That…

163
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,933
Is the idea of "Otel"

164
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,067
your own?

165
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,033
I wish it were my idea,

166
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,333
but it's actually the idea of
Ms. Manager sitting here.

167
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,933
I will continue with the design explanation.

168
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,600
I heard you wanted a party
room with a swimming pool.

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,533
Is that possible?

170
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,733
What about making a rooftop pool?

171
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,767
The plan is to create
a party room on the top floor

172
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,200
and connect it to the deck
with a flow of movement.

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,000
Then, the jazz bar currently in the basement

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
will be moved up directly below the party room,

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,167
and the lobby will be placed
on the floor below that.

176
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,000
This way, we can maximize the view.

177
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,167
Of course, this would reduce
the number of rooms, but…

178
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,633
Oh, wait.

179
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:25,167
I'll be… just excuse me for a moment.

180
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,833
It's almost perfect.

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,100
<i>Look, can you see that?</i>

182
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,400
<i>When I make money later, I'll buy that.</i>

183
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,800
<i>If I buy it, on that rooftop, I'll make a big</i>

184
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,200
<i>swimming pool that our Kang Hee likes.</i>

185
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,267
<i>Can't we just build it here?</i>

186
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>No, the actual view is better over there.</i>

187
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,100
<i>The view from there is much more impressive.</i>

188
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,267
<i>I'll make your pool that big,</i>

189
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:13,533
<i>and right underneath it, I'll
build the jazz bar that I like.</i>

190
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:19,900
<i>I'll completely move the counter
up, just like in foreign hotels.</i>

191
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,200
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh? That's nice?</i>

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,900
<i>Oh, that's nice?</i>

193
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,833
I had forgotten.

194
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,367
I had forgotten everything.

195
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,233
But Kang Hee remembered it

196
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,267
all along.

197
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,233
If you don't like the draft, we
can edit it as much as needed.

198
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,767
We also acknowledge that
it's an unreasonable change…

199
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,267
Let's do it that way.

200
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,300
Excuse me?

201
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,567
That's what I've always dreamed of.

202
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,533
Please take good care of it.

203
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:26,633
Welcome aboard.

204
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:29,733
You came all the way here.

205
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
It must not have been easy to get here.

206
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,300
I have to go to the site.

207
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:51,867
Thank you.

208
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:56,367
<i>[Motel California]</i>

209
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:19,100
<i>- This place is nice.
- Yeah, isn't it?</i>

210
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,333
<i>- Dad?
- Yes?</i>

211
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,333
<i>One of those neon signs is broken.</i>

212
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,467
<i>Yeah, I turned it off on purpose.</i>

213
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:27,833
<i>Why?</i>

214
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,500
<i>Because my dream was "Hotel California."</i>

215
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,000
<i>But the "M" is turned off, right?</i>

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,667
<i>It becomes "Otel."</i>

217
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,833
<i>Not a motel?</i>

218
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,967
<i>Otel?</i>

219
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,267
<i>Yes.</i>

220
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,600
<i>It's Otel California, Otel.</i>

221
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
<i>Otel.</i>

222
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
<i>Otel California.</i>

223
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,033
Oh.

224
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,667
Oh, Manager, have you arrived?

225
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:05,733
Say hello.

226
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,967
She's Ms. Manager, in charge
of the field starting today.

227
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,633
Look forward to working with you.

228
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,467
I have an eye infection.

229
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:15,967
How is the work?

230
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,200
So far it's okay.

231
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,400
They say there have been many problems
using groundwater, with the boiler and all.

232
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,333
It seems it will be solved
if we bring in municipal water.

233
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,833
Have you decided on the accommodation?

234
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,267
We're thinking of going to a nearby hotel.

235
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,500
Why would you do that?

236
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,633
All of our team is staying at Motel California.

237
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:39,900
It's close, clean, and
the breakfast is amazing.

238
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,967
Oh, really?

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,367
It would be uncomfortable if we stay together.

240
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:46,900
She says so.

241
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,467
You came?

242
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,333
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

243
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,133
Let's go quickly.

244
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:58,467
- Alright, we'll get going.
- Oh, yes.

245
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,633
Take care.

246
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,467
Let's see.

247
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,800
- One roll of tape, please.
- Yes.

248
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,200
- Thank you.
- Yes, take care.

249
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,633
Where is this?

250
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,867
Are we going the right way?

251
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,167
You just need to make a left turn over there.

252
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,067
This way?

253
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,833
Why is that car like that?

254
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,600
What's with that car?

255
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,567
What is it? Are you okay?

256
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,767
- I'm sorry.
- Oh?

257
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,567
That man, he's the one, right?

258
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,767
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
It's okay.

260
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,167
Get off carefully.

261
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,500
<i>I feel like he's going to get married soon.</i>

262
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,667
- Watch your step.
- <i>She's his junior from the same school.</i>

263
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,200
Excuse me, Ji Kang… No, Ms. Manager!

264
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,700
Kang Hee.

265
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
What brings you here?

266
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,367
I came here to work, at the Boomerang Motel.

267
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,433
I will finish the construction without
anyone knowing and disappear quietly.

268
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,600
So,

269
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,933
don't spread the word that I'm here.

270
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,500
If word gets out, it's all your fault.

271
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,033
Got it.

272
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,200
How long will you be here?

273
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,033
It's opening for Christmas.

274
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,600
<i>Our first love</i>

275
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,767
<i>ends here.</i>

276
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,800
<i>The end.</i>

277
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,667
I think I understand why you
were so reluctant to come here.

278
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,633
That hotel guy.

279
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,567
He's your first love, right?

280
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,867
Yeon Soo wasn't

281
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,567
my first love,

282
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,367
but my savior.

283
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,067
<i>Hey, hurry up.</i>

284
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,367
<i>Hurry up.</i>

285
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,700
<i>Are you winning by numbers,
but still feeling embarrassed?</i>

286
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,700
<i>If you're envious, recruit more to your side.</i>

287
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,067
<i>It's the transfer student!</i>

288
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,767
<i>Where, where?</i>

289
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,300
<i>Where is he? Where?</i>

290
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:30,233
<i>Don't push me.</i>

291
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,733
<i>Why is he so chubby?</i>

292
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,767
<i>I bet he is really strong.</i>

293
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,533
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

294
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,633
<i>Please give three claps.</i>

295
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:51,533
<i>Now, today we have a new friend in our class.</i>

296
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,600
<i>Can you introduce yourself?</i>

297
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:59,233
<i>Hello. My name is Cheon Yeon Soo.</i>

298
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,667
<i>Miss, over here.</i>

299
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,400
<i>This seat is not taken.</i>

300
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,567
<i>Yeon Soo, sit over there.</i>

301
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,133
<i>You shouldn't do that to a friend, be quiet.</i>

302
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,500
<i>Now, you should get along
well with Yeon Soo, got it?</i>

303
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,567
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

304
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,633
<i>How much do you weigh?</i>

305
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,667
<i>Are you good at fighting?</i>

306
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,733
<i>Do you want to become a gangster?</i>

307
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,100
<i>Well…</i>

308
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,733
<i>You'll do it? Okay</i>

309
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,233
<i>Because I like you.</i>

310
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:48,400
<i>Actually, ever since the day we
became deskmates when I was nine,</i>

311
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,767
<i>I've liked you all along.</i>

312
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,333
<i>- Hey.
- Yeah, I know I have a lot of shortcomings.</i>

313
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,167
<i>Can I…</i>

314
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,167
<i>Can I still like you?</i>

315
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,867
<i>From now on, I really need
to live diligently and well.</i>

316
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,300
<i>So that your liking me
doesn't feel embarrassing.</i>

317
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,033
<i>I need to live in a way
that's truly impressive.</i>

318
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,800
<i>Who says you are lacking?</i>

319
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,333
<i>Who says you're not good enough?</i>

320
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,167
<i>You clueless fool.</i>

321
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,833
<i>Don't say that nonsense again.</i>

322
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,200
<i>Are you laughing?</i>

323
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,367
<i>Let's go.</i>

324
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,833
<i>Let's go, quickly.</i>

325
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:09,267
I think I've always lived
being conscious of Yeon Soo.

326
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,067
If it weren't for Yeon Soo,

327
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,400
it probably would have been a complete mess,

328
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,933
whether in my teens or twenties.

329
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:26,700
Hearing that, it really pisses me off.

330
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,633
Who are the classmates that bullied you?

331
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,133
I should really give them a good scolding now.

332
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,367
There's no need. I've already
given them a good scolding.

333
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,400
If it's uncomfortable, do you
want to go back to Seoul?

334
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,167
Since the design has been confirmed,
the freelancer can proceed with it.

335
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,800
I will finalize my own design.

336
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,067
Accommodation, restaurant, titles.

337
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,967
Please just keep these three things in mind.

338
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,567
I heard Ji Kang Hee is here.

339
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,300
How did you know?

340
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,233
Earlier, my father went to
the market and heard it.

341
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,600
Is the rumor all over the market?

342
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,067
What? Did you already know it?

343
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,100
Don't tell anyone else.

344
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:04,200
Has Kang Hee not arrived yet?

345
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,467
How did you know that?

346
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,267
Yong Soo said he saw her
when he went for a delivery.

347
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,333
Of all people, blabbermouthed Yong Soo…

348
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,900
Did you meet Kang Hee?

349
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
I just happened to run into her.

350
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:16,800
She said that it was a secret
that she came here.

351
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,033
A secret?

352
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,400
You don't know this is Hana-eup?
What's with the surprise…

353
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,300
Did you hear? Ji Kang Hee came.

354
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,533
Oh my, that again…

355
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,967
I've heard that at least ten times just today.

356
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:41,233
I heard that the motel owner's daughter
came for the motel renovation.

357
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,133
Yeah, I heard that.

358
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:45,133
What's so funny about that?

359
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,733
Kang Hee is an interior design expert.

360
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,767
They say she's successful in Seoul.

361
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,933
Is she really just going around
fixing up countryside motels?

362
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,933
Kang Hee has succeeded.

363
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,833
She lives right in the middle
of Seoul with a full city view.

364
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:02,133
Her work has been featured in magazines
and won awards at international contests.

365
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,967
Why would someone like her come here?

366
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,500
She must have come specially
because it's her father's place.

367
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,700
Was Boomerang Motel owned by him?

368
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,933
Oh my, didn't you know?

369
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:15,667
That mine she invested in, gold
mine or silver mine, it struck big.

370
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,800
Yeah?

371
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,867
Whoever it is, anyone who gets
to meet Kang Hee is lucky, right?

372
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,533
The man Kang Hee is dating
now is even more successful.

373
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,367
He's an overseas graduate, young and
rich, and the heir to a hotel chain.

374
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,067
He's doing really well.

375
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:32,400
What does someone like him see
in Kang Hee to want to date her?

376
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,300
No wonder.

377
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:36,733
See you.

378
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,967
She disappears as soon as
the construction is over.

379
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:50,367
How about staying here today?

380
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:52,500
It's newly opened so it seems clean.

381
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:54,600
It's going to be crowded.

382
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
If there are too many people, there
will be more incidents and accidents.

383
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,267
Still, we can't go back to yesterday's
place. The blankets smelled.

384
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,833
Me too, rust came out of the showerhead.

385
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:05,933
So, let's just try this place today.

386
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,600
That place looks okay.

387
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,000
Sounds good.

388
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,433
Then I'll go in here.

389
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,533
Two rooms, please.

390
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:32,000
Did you sleep well?

391
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,533
No.

392
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:37,533
Did you sleep well?

393
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,533
I couldn't sleep at all.

394
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,767
There's a police officer
in the next room yelling.

395
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,233
I really can't live like this at all.

396
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,233
Me neither.

397
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,067
Rather than this, shall we go there too?

398
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,133
- Where?
- Motel California.

399
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,533
They said they serve a good breakfast.

400
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,167
We don't have to eat this.

401
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:57,467
You do that, Director.

402
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,800
Even if I have to drink dirty
water, I won't go there.

403
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,033
The person in charge from Seoul is tough.

404
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,400
Yeah.

405
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,933
She doesn't show any mercy to people
who slack off and do things carelessly.

406
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:17,067
It seems like she wore sunglasses not because
of an eye infection, but to watch things.

407
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:19,100
Still, they provide snacks generously.

408
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,200
Right, right.

409
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,967
They give out credit cards to go
to the sauna after work.

410
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,733
They give out credit cards for dining out.

411
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,900
It means that if you work hard,
they'll reward you accordingly.

412
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,933
Good, good.

413
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:31,567
Now, we've all finished
eating, right? Let's go.

414
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,300
A strict person in charge
must be Kang Hee, right?

415
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,333
Yes, that strict manager.

416
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,333
Still, they say she's a manager
who generously offers snacks.

417
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,500
Oh, but is that man the one
you're talking about?

418
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,800
Kang Hee's boyfriend?

419
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,767
I hope not.

420
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:54,900
Why?

421
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,867
I heard he's addicted to gambling.

422
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,600
His staying here instead of going to
Seoul is because of… What was that?

423
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,000
- That ca…
- Casino?

424
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:03,833
They say it's because of the casino.

425
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,833
Is it because of gambling?

426
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:09,767
From what I've heard, he spends
his days visiting a marijuana farm.

427
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:15,733
Whatever it is, shouldn't
we check it out first?

428
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,367
Huh? Who? Us? Why?

429
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,567
Because we're friends.

430
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,967
Do your best.

431
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:23,733
Cheer up.

432
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,967
It's delicious, isn't it?

433
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,333
<i>[Veterinarian License,

434
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,300
<i>[Veterinarian License, Yoon Nan Woo]</i>

435
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,667
Oh, I'm sorry. I had to step out for a moment.

436
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,800
Just a moment.

437
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,733
<i>She's pretty.</i>

438
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,533
By the way, how did you get here?

439
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,067
You came to consult about
adopting a stray dog, right?

440
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,500
Please take a seat first.
I'll get you a cup of tea.

441
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,867
We have cocoa, instant coffee, chamomile
tea. Which one would you like?

442
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,267
Chamomile tea, please.

443
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,033
Finally…

444
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,967
I only drink cocoa, and the director
only drinks instant coffee.

445
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,033
But he specifically bought chamomile tea.

446
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,600
He even bought the high-end kind.

447
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,867
The director says he has a friend
who likes chamomile tea.

448
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,433
<i>Would you like a glass of wine?</i>

449
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,433
<i>I'm cold.</i>

450
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>Oh, right?</i>

451
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,367
<i>I'll give you something warm.</i>

452
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:46,600
<i>Do you have chamomile tea?</i>

453
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,833
Is the director not here?

454
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,867
He's busy with many business trips.

455
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,633
What kind of person is the director?

456
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:06,267
He truly loves animals.

457
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,267
Not just animals, he's even better with people.

458
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:15,200
In a word, a real adult
I can trust and rely on.

459
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,500
A real man.

460
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,600
There's a photo over there.
Would you like to take a look?

461
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:31,433
<i>[Hana Veterinary Clinic opening
celebration, Dr. Cheon & Dr. Yoon]</i>

462
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,500
Our director is cool, right?

463
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,400
Oh, Kkam Hee.

464
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,700
It's the first time I see Kkam Hee doing this.

465
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,600
She's not usually like this.

466
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,033
This is too amazing, hold on.

467
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,133
Oh, I'm sorry for taking it without permission.

468
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,067
But would you still like to see it?

469
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,967
If you don't like it, I'll
delete it right away.

470
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,167
Just look at it for a moment.

471
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,967
Why are you so cute today?

472
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:31,800
Shall we go up?

473
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,800
Why are you alone? Huh?

474
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,700
Hey, are you okay?

475
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,800
Just a moment.

476
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,667
Just a moment.

477
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:24,500
Just a moment.

478
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,033
Wait just a moment.

479
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,100
Could you pull the line tight for a moment?

480
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Oh, yes.

481
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,433
Where is the nearest animal
hospital around here?

482
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,667
I can take him there.

483
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,000
You are a veterinarian.

484
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,767
Please save this little one at all costs.

485
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,733
I don't care how much the treatment costs.

486
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,833
I will take good care of the treatment.

487
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Instead,

488
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,533
may I ask a few questions?

489
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:23,700
Of course.

490
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,067
<i>They say he's addicted to gambling.</i>

491
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:31,233
<i>From what I've heard, he spends
his days visiting a marijuana farm.</i>

492
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,000
You said you had questions.

493
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:41,367
Could it be that Kang Hee is wearing sunglasses

494
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,000
because of bruises?

495
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:52,733
Kang Hee isn't the type to
go around getting beaten.

496
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:55,833
Well then, that's a relief.

497
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,500
Please take good care of him.

498
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yesterday, a dead cat was found
near the construction site as well.

499
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:19,167
I'm afraid it might be
the work of that man from Seoul.

500
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,667
These things never happened
in our village before.

501
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,433
He's not the kind of person.

502
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,433
You can't tell just by looking at the surface.

503
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,200
Yeon Soo, have you experienced it?

504
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,833
Yes, I've experienced it all.

505
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,867
So, mister, please don't spread strange rumors.

506
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,600
Well, that's a relief then.

507
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,233
It seems like there's something going
on between him and Kang Hee.

508
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,667
He shouldn't be a bad guy.

509
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,333
Oh, right, have you watched Kkam Hee's video?

510
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,700
I sent it earlier.

511
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,767
Oh, really?

512
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,633
She's super cute.

513
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,033
What?

514
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,233
Did Kang Hee come here?

515
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:09,700
I don't know who she was, but
she was looking for chamomile tea.

516
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,267
What's going on?

517
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,167
It's dangerous, it's dangerous. What's up?

518
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,467
Hello.

519
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,567
By any chance, a lady from Seoul…

520
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,167
Oh, the person in charge.

521
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,767
I haven't seen her since earlier.

522
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,400
Did she go to Seoul with Manager Geum?

523
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,000
- Thank you.
- Oh, yes.

524
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,200
Ah Reum.

525
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,133
Did Kang Hee not come here?

526
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,367
Stop being so interested in Kang Hee.

527
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,667
Right now, Kang Hee is having
a hard time, even without you.

528
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,733
Why?

529
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:05,500
I heard the people in the neighborhood took

530
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:14,767
Did you change your style?

531
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,500
It's the most workwear-like, isn't it?

532
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,867
I'll wear this.

533
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,233
How long are you planning to stay there?

534
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:22,900
I have to stay at least until
the Christmas opening.

535
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,833
I thought you wouldn't last
a week in the countryside.

536
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:26,967
It's hard.

537
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:29,833
The accommodations are a mess,
and the food doesn't suit my taste.

538
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:34,267
But why do you go there?
You don't have to go anymore.

539
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:37,133
I know.

540
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:38,633
Is it because of Ms. Ji Kang Hee?

541
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,500

Did you see the changed design?

544
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:56,367
Ji Kang Hee changed it boldly as expected.

545
00:38:56,367 --> 00:39:00,100
I couldn't go that far myself.

546
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,433
The client actually seemed to like it.

547
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:05,033
My injury turned out to
be a blessing in disguise.

548
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:06,567
How's the construction progress?

549
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,967
Demolition is finished,
and pipe work has started.

550
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,333
They need to speed up.
It's getting cold quickly.

551
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,200
Yes, I was actually planning
to pull an all-nighter tonight.

552
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,367
Is Kang Hee doing well?

553
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:27,533
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I just stepped out for a moment.</i>

554
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,967
<i>Just a moment.</i>

555
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,000
She's adorable.

<i>Please have a seat. I'll get you a cup of tea.</i>

557
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,833
She's well-rounded.

558
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,833
She suits

One bowl of gukbap, please.

568

Did Kang Hee call you?

569
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,900
The owner of the restaurant called us.

570
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:01,767
He said Ji Kang Hee drank four
bottles by herself and passed out.

571
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:02,833
It was quite cold today, right?

572
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,400
It was so cold at the construction site,

573
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,800
but with this warm ondol, hot gukbap,

574
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,767
and sweet soju, of course, she'd get drunk.

575
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,967
Kang Hee isn't drunk right
now. She's just sleepy.

576
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:16,133
She's sensitive, so she probably couldn't
sleep well after coming down here.

577
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,133
Is that so?

578
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:22,233
Is that so? That could be possible.

579
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:25,900
Have a drink.

580
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:30,067
Leave her be. Just let her sleep.

581
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:34,333
Well, well.

582
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:38,967
Rumors are spreading in the neighborhood,
so she's probably been bothered by it.

583
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:43,600
But what's the point of wearing sunglasses
all day? This is just a small town.

584
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,067
Here…

585
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,900

Go inside.

614
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,333
Let's send her to room 304.

615
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:09,633
She drank four bottles of soju alone.

00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,333
Oh, is that so?

708
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,700
Yes, I'll be there now, in a moment.

709
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,133
Please wait a little, yes.

710
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:39,433
Oh my, the vet is going
to collapse at this rate.

711
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:42,367
How many times has it been that
he ran out in the middle of breakfast?

712
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:43,633
He makes a lot of money, doesn't he?

713
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:47,133
If he wants to make money, it's better
to go to Seoul and run an animal hospital.

714
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:52,133
Working as a livestock vet in a rural area
can't be done without a sense of duty.

715

You don't know it well.

716
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,667
The work is tough, but he earns so much money.

717
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:59,700
I don't know who it will be,
but his future wife is lucky.

718
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:02,800
That doesn't matter to him.

719
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,700
The person who will be his wife is also a vet.

720
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:10,500
I saw them when I went to the restaurant
before, and they looked good together.

Let's go.

723
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,800

726

Well, it wasn't me.

727

What?

728
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,800
What are you listening to?

729
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,100
An audiobook.

730
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:28,533
You've become quite the intellectual
since I last saw you.

731
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:33,467
Ryu Han Woo.

732
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:36,567
Why on earth do you live here?

733
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,700
I said I was going to raise cattle,
but I got kicked out of the house.

734
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,433
Weren't you a stockbroker?

735
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,800
Life in Seoul was getting tiresome.

736
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,067
Don't you feel the same?

737
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:53,467
Should I give you more soup?

738
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:57,000
What happened to you, mister?

739
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,033
Since when did you become so good at cooking?

740
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:08,933
The lady from family mart
closed up mart and came here.

741
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:11,767
- Huh?
- With Mr. Kwon.

742
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:13,433
With the family mart lady?

743
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,067
Shh.

744
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,633
So, they've become family together?

745
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:20,667
They've become a family, indeed.

I understand why you said you wouldn't come.

751
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,633
But why did you suddenly change
your mind about coming?

752
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:49,933
I've been worried about it all night.

753
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,500
But I found the answer this morning.

754
00:57:55,133 --> 00:57:57,033
The person who will marry Yeon Soo.

755
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:01,100
You were curious about that person, aren't you?

756
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,667
Don't cross the line.

757
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,267

758
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:06,467
Oh, I know well.

759

I thought I was going crazy with curiosity.

762
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:21,733
Eventually, I went to Victor and proposed
that we start a business together.

763
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:25,767
Because I wanted to check for
myself if he was a good guy or not.

764
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:28,867
I envy you.

765

I can't even suggest to the vet to work
on the motel construction together.

I don't even have an excuse to go see him.
