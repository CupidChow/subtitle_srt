1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,080


2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,300
 You shouldn't do this, stop it. 

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,067
 - Let go! 
 - Jeez, go back. 

4
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,367
 Cheon Yeon Soo. 

5
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,600
 Move aside, I have something to say to Cheon Yeon Soo. 

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,933
 At this point, what do you even have to say to him? 

7
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,667
 It's too late, Kang Hee. 

8
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,233
 Doing this will only make Yeon Soo suffer. 

9
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,430
 Just a moment. 

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,560
 Yeon Soo. 

11
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:57,400
 Yeon Soo. 

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,533
 How long have you been together that you're already getting married? 

13
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,167
 Are you sure you know what you're getting into? 

14
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,800
 Aren't you just being charmed by a vixen? 

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,433
 Don't speak recklessly. 

16
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,333
 What? You said you'd only wait for me. 

17
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,800
 You said you only liked me! 

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,767
 First love, the end. This is what you said. 

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,867
 You're now a woman of the past to me. 

20
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,900
 Goodbye, Ji Kang Hee. 

21
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,333
   

22
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,533
 Let's go inside. 

23
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,367
 Cheon Yeon Soo. 

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,567
 Yeon Soo. 

25
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,367
 Cheon Yeon Soo! 

26
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,100
 Yeon Soo. 

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,133
 He's just like his name, Cheon Yeon Soo. 

28
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,733
 He's completely innocent. 

29
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,430
 He has a house and a hospital, 

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,200
 so I should take my share and leave. 

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,533
 Wait a bit, sweetheart. 

32
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,900
 What on Earth did you do to Yeon Soo? 

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,867
 Let me see your face first. 

34
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,500
No, you can't.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,033
Hey, hey, Kang Hee!

36
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,733
No, you can't.

37
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:13,167
Hey! Let go. What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,567
What kind of dream did you have? Why are you doing this to me?

40
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,300
- Ah Reum. 
 - Yes.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,533
By any chance, what do you think would happen

42
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:36,600
if I went back to Hana-eup and worked there?

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,867
You had a nightmare, right?

44
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,733
The dream of returning to Hana-eup.

45
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,667
Don't be scared. You haven't done anything wrong.

46
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,900
It all happened so long ago.

47
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,567
And both you and Yeon Soo have found your own partners, so what will happen?

48
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,667
Don't worry and come.

49
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,700
No, that won't happen.

50
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:04,167
Hana-eup doesn't have a hotel or a shopping mall.

51
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,200
I won't go back.

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,867
I'll go.

53
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,300
- Where to? 
 - To Hana-eup.

54
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,800
I said I'll go.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,367
The CEO has already left.

56
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,467
- Room 7112. 
 - Over there, over there.

57
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,133
Are you…

58
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:29,300
Are you okay? How badly are you hurt

59
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,000
As you can see, I'm alive.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,633
The car almost needs scrapping, so I'm glad it's not worse.

61
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,500
Does a left turn without protection even make sense?

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Why would they create a signal that doesn't even provide protection?

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,167
You should have been careful.

64
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,767
Shall I call someone?

65
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:49,433
No, no. I'm fine.

66
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:52,200
What should we do about the Hana-eup case?

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
The weather is getting colder.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,767
We can't postpone the construction until my leg heals.

69
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,867
The incentive.

70
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,800
It's double, right?

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,867
- Will you go? 
 - I can change the design, right?

72
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,367
Are you going to do that for me as well?

73
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,000
We'll have to reschedule the meeting.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,267
Since Director Geum knows all about the site progress, you two go together.

75
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,133
- Pardon? 
 - Yes, sir.

76
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,867
Are you going on a cruise or something?

77
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,167
Are you the heading to the prosecutor's office photo line?

78
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,367
If you go to the site like that, you'll ruin your clothes.

79
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,933
What's the use in saving clothes that I'll throw away after the season?

80
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,700
Buying other clohes, that's wasteful.

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,100
There's one condition if we go together.

82
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,167
   

83
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,233
Let's book accommodation 30 minutes away in the city.

84
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,900
Why?

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,500
You've never lived in the countryside, right?

86
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
I know from experience, people there love to talk.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,367
They complain about the construction noise being too loud,

88
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,067
say they'll bring the whole family to introduce them,

89
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,700
- and come over anytime, day or night, without notice. It's really a headache. 
 - Deal.

90
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,200
For the same reasons, if we run into someone at a restaurant, it's tiring

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,733
so let's have everything delivered.

92
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,833
Okay.

93
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,967
And this is the most important thing.

94
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,167
Is there more?

95
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,467
Please don't call me by my name.

96
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,667
Excuse me?

97
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,167
If I don't call you Ji Kang Hee, what should I call you?

98
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,267
We've met through work.

99
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,133
There are clearly designated titles in the company. Right?

100
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,233
Oh, you care about that sort of thing.

101
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,467
Got it, Assistant Manager Ji.

102
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,900
Don't call me that either.

103
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,533
Then what do you want me to do?

104
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,633
Ms. Ji Kang Hee, Assistant Manager Ji.

105
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,833
As long as you don't call me like this, it's fine.

106
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,967
Look here, hey, you there, hey.

107
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,933
- Well… 
 - All right.

108
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:05,867
Missus.* 
 (*"Imja" can mean owner, person in charge, but also "spouse" or "darling")

109
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,100
Huh?

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,333
I mean, you are the person in charge. Right?

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,567
Missus.

112
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,967
   

113
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,233
Please get off, Ms. Manager.* 
  (*Here he uses a non-ambiguous term.) 

114
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,067
   

115
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,033
Isn't the site across the street?

116
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,133
You know this neighborhood well.

117
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,833
I saw it on the map. On the map.

118
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,033
Are you going to have the client meeting at the construction site?

119
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,533
That's not it, but…

120
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,333
But why here of all places?

121
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,267
Because the owner here is the client.

122
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,267
- Excuse me? 
 - Bring all the blueprints with you.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,970
Nice to meet you.

124
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,330
I am the designer in charge of the interior.

125
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,567
But…

126
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,500
I entrusted the work to Ms. Hwang,

127
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,567
because I trust her.

128
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:33,767
We will proceed as soon as she recovers,

129
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:37,833
so you two should go back now.

130
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,167
Ms. Manager here is our company's ace,

131
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,800
the one that Ms. Hwang trusts and believes in the most.

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
My father also runs a motel,

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,967
so I'm confident that I know what you want better than anyone.

134
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,533
Yeah?

135
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:02,167
Where does he run a motel?

136
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,700
He passed away when she was ten.

137
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,567
I see. Then…

138
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:19,133
Then, shall I hear how well

139
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:22,400
you know what I want?

140
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:27,700
Our company pursues a remodeling franchise business

141
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,967
that views motels as cultural spaces.

142
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:35,667
Simply put, it's about branding motels like hotels.

143
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:44,900
   

144
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,267
   

145
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,067
Do you see the difference between the two?

146
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,433
Let me eliminate this difference.

147
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,667
Ta-da.

148
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,333
This "Otel," which eliminates the difference between a motel and a hotel,

149
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,333
is our brand.

150
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,500
So, it's not "Motel Boomerang,"

151
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,767
but "Otel Hana" instead.

152
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,967
That…

153
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:20,033
Is the idea of "Otel" your own?

154
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,033
I wish it were my idea,

155
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,933
but it's actually the idea of Ms. Manager sitting here.

156
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,433
I will continue with the design explanation.

157
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,930
   
   

158
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,400
I heard you wanted a party room with a swimming pool.

159
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,533
Is that possible?

160
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:59,433
What about making a rooftop pool?

161
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,467
The plan is to create a party room on the top floor

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,800
and connect it to the deck with a flow of movement.

163
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Then, the jazz bar currently in the basement

164
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,400
will be moved up directly below the party room,

165
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,067
and the lobby will be placed on the floor below that.

166
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:23,700
This way, we can maximize the view.

167
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:31,067
Of course, this would reduce the number of rooms, but…

168
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,533
Oh, wait.

169
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,620
I'll be…

170
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,760
just excuse me for a moment.

171
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,633
It's almost perfect.

172
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,100
 Look! Can you see that? 

173
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,067
 When I make money later, I'll buy that. 

174
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:14,000
 If I buy it, on that rooftop, I'll make a big 

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
 swimming pool that our Kang Hee likes. 

176
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,267
 Can't we just build it here? 

177
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:23,200
 No, the actual view is better over there. 

178
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,100
 The view from there is much more impressive. 

179
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,167
 I'll make your pool that big, 

180
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:33,967
 and right underneath it, I'll build the jazz bar that I like. 

181
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:39,600
 I'll completely move the counter up, just like in foreign hotels. Yeah. 

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 - Oh? That's nice? 
 - Oh, that's nice? 

183
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,633
I had forgotten.

184
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,967
I had forgotten everything.

185
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,033
But Kang Hee remembered it...

186
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,867
all along.

187
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,933
If you don't like the draft, we can edit it as much as needed.

188
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,867
We also acknowledge that it's an unreasonable change…

189
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,367
Let's do it that way.

190
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,400
Excuse me?

191
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,367
That's what I've always dreamed of.

192
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,133
Please take good care of it.

193
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,233
Welcome aboard.

194
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,233
You came all the way here.

195
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,400
It must not have been easy to get here.

196
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,600
I have to go to the site.

197
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,633
Thank you.

198
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:15,467
   

199
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,800
 - This place is nice. 
 - Yeah, isn't it? 

200
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,433
 - Dad? 
 - Yes? 

201
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,433
 One of those neon signs is broken. 

202
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,467
 Yeah, I turned it off on purpose. 

203
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,933
 Why? 

204
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:51,100
 Because my dream was "Hotel California." 

205
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,000
 But the "M" is turned off, right? 

206
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,300
 It becomes "Otel." 

207
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,733
 Not a motel? 

208
00:14:58,733 --> 00:14:59,967
 Otel? 

209
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,267
 Yes. 

210
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,500
 - It's Otel California, Otel. 
 - Otel. 

211
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,000
 Otel California. 

212
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,633
Oh, Manager, have you arrived?

213
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:24,833
Say hello.

214
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,067
She's the manager in charge of the field starting today.

215
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,233
I look forward to working with you.

216
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,567
I have an eye infection.

217
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,067
How is the work?

218
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,200
So far it's okay.

219
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,200
They say there have been many problems using groundwater, with the boiler and all.

220
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,333
It seems it will be solved if we bring in municipal water.

221
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,933
Have you decided on the accommodation?

222
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,967
We're thinking of going to a nearby hotel.

223
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,600
Why would you do that?

224
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,733
All of our team is staying at Motel California.

225
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:59,000
It's close, clean, and the breakfast is amazing.

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,567
Oh, really?

227
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,033
It would be uncomfortable if we stay together.

228
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,700
She says so.

229
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,367
You came?

230
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,133
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

231
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,233
Let's go quickly.

232
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,367
- All right, we'll get going. 
 - Oh, yes.

233
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,133
Take care.

234
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,467
Let's see.

235
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,367
- One roll of tape, please. 
 - Yes.

236
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,300
- Thank you. 
 - Yes, take care.

237
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,400
Where is this?

238
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,467
Are we going the right way?

239
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:36,033
You just need to make a left turn over there.

240
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,867
This way?

241
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,533
Why is that car like that?

242
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,300
What's with that car?

243
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,267
What is it? Are you okay?

244
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,867
- I'm sorry. 
 - Oh?

245
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,567
That man. He's the one, right?

246
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,367
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
It's okay.

248
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,767
Get off carefully.

249
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,500
 I feel like he's going to get married soon. 

250
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,367
- Watch your step. 
  - She's his junior from the same school. 

251
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:14,000
Excuse me, Ji Kang… No, Ms. Manager!

252
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,400
Kang Hee.

253
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
What brings you here?

254
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:37,367
I came here to work, at the Boomerang Motel.

255
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:42,533
I will finish the construction without anyone knowing and disappear quietly.

256
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,200
So,

257
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,533
don't spread the word that I'm here.

258
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,200
If word gets out, it's all your fault.

259
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,667
Got it.

260
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,900
How long will you be here?

261
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,933
It's opening for Christmas.

262
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,600
 Our first love... is over. 

263
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,300
 The end. 

264
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:17,670
♫  Blue, dark gray, calm and sweet  ♫

265
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,550
♫  I can give you all  ♫

266
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:30,390
♫  Please tell me if you're standing here for me  ♫

267
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,700
♫  Far across the dream, just call my name  ♫

268
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,390
♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

269
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,570
♫  Here I am  ♫

270
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,000
♫  Where I am  ♫

271
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,467
I think I understand why you were so reluctant to come here.

272
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,433
That hotel guy.

273
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,367
He's your first love, right?

274
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,467
Yeon Soo wasn't...

275
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,067
my first love,

276
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,067
but my savior.

277
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,167
 Hey, hurry up. 

278
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,467
 Hurry up. 

279
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,700
 Aren't you embarrassed for ganging up on people? 

280
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,300
 If you're envious, recruit more to your side. 

281
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,900
 It's the transfer student! 

282
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,867
 Where? Where? 

283
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,400
 Where is he? Where? 

284
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:50,033
 Don't push me. 

285
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,733
 Why is he so chubby? 

286
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,767
 I bet he is really strong. 

287
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,233
 Please take your seats. 

288
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,467
 Please give three claps. 

289
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:11,267
 Now, today we have a new friend in our class. 

290
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,300
 Can you introduce yourself? 

291
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:18,233
 Hello. My name is Cheon Yeon Soo. 

292
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,767
 Miss, over here. 

293
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,100
 This seat is not taken. 

294
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,167
 Yeon Soo, sit over there. 

295
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,933
 You shouldn't do that to a friend, be quiet. 

296
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:35,600
 Now, you should get along well with Yeon Soo, got it? 

297
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,667
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

298
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,333
 How much do you weigh? 

299
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,367
 Are you good at fighting? 

300
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,233
 Do you want to become a gangster? 

301
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:50,600
 - Well…  
  - You'll do it? Okay 

302
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,467
 Because I like you. 

303
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:08,300
 Actually, ever since the day we became deskmates when I was nine, 

304
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,667
 - I've liked you all along.  
  - Hey. 

305
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:15,233
 Yeah, I know I have a lot of shortcomings. 

306
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,667
 Can I… 

307
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:23,067
 Can I still like you? 

308
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,867
 From now on, I really need to live diligently and well. 

309
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:44,100
 So that your liking me doesn't feel embarrassing. 

310
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,833
 I need to live in a way that's truly impressive. 

311
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,800
 Who says you are lacking? 

312
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,133
 Who says you're not good enough? 

313
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,900
 You clueless fool. 

314
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,733
 Don't say that nonsense again. 

315
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
 Are you laughing? 

316
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,667
 Let's go. 

317
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,833
 Let's go, quickly. 

318
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,667
I think I've always lived being conscious of Yeon Soo.

319
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,567
If it weren't for Yeon Soo,

320
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,200
I probably would have been a complete mess,

321
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,433
in my teens and twenties.

322
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,800
Hearing that, it really pisses me off.

323
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,633
Who are the classmates that bullied you?

324
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:52,133
I should really give them a good scolding now.

325
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,790
There's no need.

326
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,260
I've already given them a good scolding.

327
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,300
If it's uncomfortable, do you want to go back to Seoul?

328
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,967
Since the design has been confirmed, a freelancer can proceed with it.

329
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,800
I will finalize my own design.

330
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,667
Accommodation, restaurant, terms of address.

331
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,667
Please just keep these three things in mind.

332
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:08,967
I heard Ji Kang Hee is here.

333
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,300
How did you know?

334
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,333
Earlier, my father went to the market and heard it.

335
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,600
Is the rumor all over the market?

336
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,767
What? Did you already know it?

337
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,800
Don't tell anyone else.

338
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:23,200
Has Kang Hee not arrived yet?

339
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,067
How did you know that?

340
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,667
Yong Soo said he saw her when he went for a delivery.

341
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,333
Of all people, blabbermouth Yong Soo…

342
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,900
Did you meet Kang Hee?

343
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,500
I just happened to run into her.

344
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,100
- She said that it was a secret that she came here. 
 - A secret?

345
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,560
You don't know this is Hana-eup?

346
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,100
What's with the surprise…

347
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,300
Did you hear? Ji Kang Hee came.

348
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,533
Oh my, that again…

349
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,967
I've heard that at least ten times just today.

350
00:25:56,967 --> 00:26:01,133
I heard that the motel owner's daughter came for the motel renovation.

351
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,133
Yeah, I heard that.

352
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,133
What's so funny about that?

353
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:07,633
Kang Hee is an interior design expert.

354
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,367
They say she's successful in Seoul.

355
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,933
Is she really just going around fixing up countryside motels?

356
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,933
Kang Hee has succeeded.

357
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,833
She lives right in the middle of Seoul with a full city view.

358
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:21,133
Her work has been featured in magazines and won awards at international contests.

359
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:24,067
Why would someone like her come here?

360
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:27,400
She must have come specially because it's her father's place.

361
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,700
Was Boomerang Motel owned by him?

362
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,033
Oh my, didn't you know?

363
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:34,667
That mine she invested in, gold mine or silver mine, it struck big.

364
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah?

365
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,967
Whoever it is, anyone who gets to date Kang Hee is lucky. Right?

366
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,533
The man Kang Hee is dating now is even more successful.

367
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,467
He's an overseas graduate, young and rich, and the heir to a hotel chain.

368
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,067
He's doing really well.

369
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:52,200
What does someone like him see in Kang Hee to want to date her?

370
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,900
No wonder.

371
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:56,333
See you.

372
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,567
She disappears as soon as the construction is over.

373
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,367
How about staying here today?

374
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:12,300
It's newly opened so it seems clean.

375
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,500
It's going to be crowded.

376
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,800
If there are too many people, there will be more incidents and accidents.

377
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,267
Still, we can't go back to yesterday's place. The blankets smelled.

378
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,833
Me too, rust came out of the showerhead.

379
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,933
So, let's just try this place today.

380
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,600
That place looks okay.

381
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,000
Sounds good.

382
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,233
Then I'll go in here.

383
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,133
Two rooms, please.

384
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,800
Did you sleep well?

385
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,933
No.

386
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,133
Did you sleep well?

387
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,533
I couldn't sleep at all.

388
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:01,667
There was a police officer in the next room yelling.

389
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,133
I really can't live like this at all.

390
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:06,333
Me neither.

391
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:09,067
Rather than this, shall we go there too?

392
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,133
- Where? 
 - Motel California.

393
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:13,633
They said they serve a good breakfast.

394
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,267
We don't have to eat this.

395
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:16,567
You do that, Director.

396
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,700
Even if I have to drink dirty water, I won't go there.

397
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,033
The person in charge from Seoul is tough.

398
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,400
Yeah.

399
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,433
She doesn't show any mercy to people who slack off and do things carelessly.

400
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:34,280
It seems like she wore sunglasses not because of an eye infection,

401
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,060
but to watch things.

402
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:38,000
Still, they provide snacks generously.

403
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Right, right.

404
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,967
They give out credit cards to go to the sauna after work.

405
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,733
They give out credit cards for dining out.

406
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:46,900
It means that if you work hard, they'll reward you accordingly.

407
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,333
Good, good.

408
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:51,367
Now, we've all finished eating, right? Let's go.

409
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,300
The strict person in charge must be Kang Hee, right?

410
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,133
Yes, that strict manager.

411
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:06,333
Still, they say she's a manager who generously offers snacks.

412
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,500
Oh, but is that man the one you're talking about?

413
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,800
Kang Hee's boyfriend?

414
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,767
I hope not.

415
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,300
Why?

416
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,867
I heard he's addicted to gambling.

417
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:19,500
His staying here instead of going to Seoul is because of… What was that?

418
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
- That ca… 
 - Casino?

419
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,933
They say it's because of the casino.

420
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,733
Is it because of gambling?

421
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:29,667
From what I've heard, he spends his days visiting a marijuana farm.

422
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,833
Whatever it is, shouldn't we check it out first?

423
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,367
Huh? Who? Us? Why?

424
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:39,900
Because we're friends.

425
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,667
Do your best.

426
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,833
Cheer up.

427
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,467
It's delicious, isn't it?

428
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,633
   

429
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,500
   

430
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,667
Oh, I'm sorry. I had to step out for a moment.

431
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,500
Just a moment.

432
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,433
 She's pretty. 

433
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,033
By the way, what are you here for?

434
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,167
You came to consult about adopting a stray dog, right?

435
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:26,200
Please take a seat first. I'll get you a cup of tea.

436
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,967
We have cocoa, instant coffee, chamomile tea. Which one would you like?

437
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,767
Chamomile tea, please.

438
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,633
Finally…

439
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,167
I only drink cocoa, and the director only drinks instant coffee.

440
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,933
But he specifically bought chamomile tea.

441
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:48,700
He even bought the high-end kind.

442
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,667
The director says he has a friend who likes chamomile tea.

443
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,133
 Would you like a glass of wine? 

444
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,433
 I'm cold. 

445
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:03,000
 Oh, right? I'll give you something warm. 

446
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,200
 Do you have chamomile tea? 

447
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,933
Is the director not here?

448
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:14,710
He's busy with many business trips.

449
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,333
What kind of person is the director?

450
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:26,067
He truly loves animals.

451
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:29,267
Not just animals, he's even better with people.

452
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:35,100
In a word, a real adult I can trust and rely on.

453
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
A real man.

454
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:42,200
There's a photo over there. Would you like to take a look?

455
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:53,300
Our director is cool, right ?
    

456
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,400
Oh, Kkam Hee.

457
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,700
It's the first time I see Kkam Hee doing this.

458
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,100
She's not usually like this.

459
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,233
This is too amazing, hold on.

460
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,733
Oh, I'm sorry for taking it without permission.

461
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,267
But would you still like to see it?

462
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,567
If you don't like it, I'll delete it right away.

463
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,567
Just look at it for a moment.

464
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:49,233
Why are you so cute today?

465
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:51,300
Shall we go up?

466
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,500
Why are you alone? Huh?

467
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,667
Hey, are you okay?

468
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:41,567
Just a moment. Just a moment.

469
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,300
Just a moment.

470
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,933
Wait just a moment.

471
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,200
Could you pull the line tight for a moment?

472
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, yes.

473
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:25,233
Where is the nearest animal hospital around here?

474
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,433
I can take him there.

475
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:29,000
You are a veterinarian.

476
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,767
Please save this little one at all costs.

477
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,833
I don't care how much the treatment costs.

478
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:35,333
I will take good care of the treatment.

479
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,000
Instead,

480
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:41,633
may I ask a few questions?

481
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,400
Of course.

482
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:46,167
 They say he's addicted to gambling. 

483
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:51,233
 From what I've heard, he spends his days visiting a marijuana farm. 

484
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,800
You said you had questions.

485
00:35:57,033 --> 00:36:01,367
Could it be that Kang Hee is wearing sunglasses...

486
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,800
because of bruises?

487
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:12,510
Kang Hee isn't the type to go around getting beaten.

488
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:16,067
Well then, that's a relief.

489
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,600
Please take good care of him.

490
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,600
Yesterday, a dead cat was found near the construction site as well.

491
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,667
I'm afraid it might be the work of that man from Seoul.

492
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,667
These things never happened in our village before.

493
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,433
He's not the kind of person.

494
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,233
You can't tell just by looking at the surface.

495
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeon Soo, have you experienced it?

496
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,833
Yes, I've experienced it all.

497
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,967
So, mister, please don't spread strange rumors.

498
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:55,300
Well, that's a relief then.

499
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,833
It seems like there's something going on between him and Kang Hee.

500
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,267
He shouldn't be a bad guy.

501
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:04,333
Oh, right! Have you watched Kkam Hee's video?

502
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,800
I sent it earlier.

503
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,667
Oh, really?

504
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,533
She's super cute.

505
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,633
What?

506
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,233
Did Kang Hee come here?

507
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,740
I don't know who she was,

508
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,600
but she was looking for chamomile tea.

509
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,967
What's going on?

510
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,267
It's dangerous, it's dangerous. What's up?

511
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,467
Hello.

512
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:48,567
By any chance, a lady from Seoul…

513
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,267
Oh, the person in charge.

514
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,767
I haven't seen her since earlier.

515
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:54,100
Did she go to Seoul with Manager Geum?

516
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:57,300
- Thank you. 
 - Oh, yes.

517
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,700
Ah Reum.

518
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:10,933
Did Kang Hee not come here?

519
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,367
Stop being so interested in Kang Hee.

520
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,567
Right now, Kang Hee is having a hard time, even without you.

521
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,233
Why?

522
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:25,080
I heard the people in the neighborhood take turns coming to watch her every day of the week.

523
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:33,867
Did you change your style?

524
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:35,600
It's the most workwear-like, isn't it?

525
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,667
I'll wear this.

526
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,333
How long are you planning to stay there?

527
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,900
I have to stay at least until the Christmas opening.

528
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,833
I thought you wouldn't last a week in the countryside.

529
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:45,967
It's hard.

530
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:50,033
The accommodations are a mess, and the food doesn't suit my taste.

531
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:54,067
But why do you go there? You don't have to go anymore.

532
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,133
I know.

533
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,533
Is it because of Ms. Ji Kang Hee?

534
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,200
Is it because of her?

535
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,033
   

536
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:12,367
Did you see the changed design?

537
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:15,467
Ji Kang Hee changed it boldly, as expected.

538
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:19,100
I was worried I wouldn't be able to persuade the client if I took it that far.

539
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,533
The client actually seemed to like it.

540
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,033
My injury turned out to be a blessing in disguise.

541
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,567
How's the construction progress?

542
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:28,067
Demolition is finished, and the pipe work has started.

543
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,433
They need to speed up. It's getting cold quickly.

544
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:33,300
Yes, I was actually planning to pull an all-nighter tonight.

545
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,367
Is Kang Hee doing well?

546
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:47,633
 Oh, I'm sorry. I just stepped out for a moment. 

547
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,467
 Just a moment. 

548
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
She's adorable.

549
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,500
 Please have a seat. I'll get you a cup of tea. 

550
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:02,033
She's sweet.

551
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,733
She suits...

552
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,367
Yeon Soo.

553
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,033
   

554
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,933
She should have taken the picture with her face showing more.

555
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:48,167
   

556
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:51,367
What? I'm busy.

557
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,833
Where are you?

558
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:02,600
Oh.

559
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,267
You haven't eaten, have you?

560
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:10,733
One bowl of rice soup, please.

561
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,133
Did Kang Hee call you?

562
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:16,867
The owner of the restaurant called us.

563
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:20,867
He said Ji Kang Hee drank four bottles by herself and passed out.

564
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:21,933
It was quite cold today, right?

565
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:24,100
It was so cold at the construction site,

566
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,900
but with this warm ondol, hot rice soup,

567
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,767
and sweet soju, of course, she'd get drunk.

568
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,067
Kang Hee isn't drunk right now. She's just sleepy.

569
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:36,133
She's sensitive, so she probably couldn't sleep well after coming down here.

570
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,733
Is that so?

571
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:42,133
Is that so? That could be possible.

572
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,800
Have a drink.

573
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:50,367
Leave her be. Just let her sleep.

574
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:54,033
Well, well.

575
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:57,967
Rumors are spreading in the neighborhood, so she's probably been bothered by it.

576
00:41:57,967 --> 00:42:02,700
But what's the point of wearing sunglasses all day? This is just a small town.

577
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,567
Here…

578
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,400
What is she doing?

579
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:20,233
Hey.

580
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,300
What? Why?

581
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,633
Why aren't you stopping her?

582
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
She's sleeping. I don't want to wake her up.

583
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,633
Wake her up.

584
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:40,600
I'll go pay the bill first and come back.

585
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,900
Okay.

586
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,533
Sir.

587
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,967
Should I go pay the bill, too?

588
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,700
Hey.

589
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,767
Jeez.

590
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,367
Does anyone know where Kang Hee is staying?

591
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:19,600
Does nobody know?

592
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,367
Oh, this is a big deal.

593
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,567
Ah, you know that guy? Try contacting him.

594
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,400
Don't you have his number?

595
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,967
Let's just go home today.

596
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:33,433
Where? Mr. Chun Pil's house?

597
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:34,733
It's going to be chaos.

598
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,600
It would cause a big fuss.

599
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,533
It's her fault for drinking so much.

600
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,133
I don't know. You guys figure it out.

601
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,133
I can't take responsibility.

602
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:04,520
What's going on?

603
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,300
She must have been tired.

604
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:11,900
Go inside.

605
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,233
Let's send her to room 304.

606
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,433
She drank four bottles of soju alone.

607
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:23,933
Careful, careful.

608
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,933
Hey, Yeon Soo, just a moment.

609
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,267
Hey, her shoes, shoes.

610
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:38,133
Thank you.

611
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,333
Don't go.

612
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,267
Where is Ms. Manager?

613
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:49,900
Didn't you go to Seoul with her?

614
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,033
I haven't seen her since earlier.

615
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:55,267
There are a lot of men looking for her today.

616
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,467
Manager Geum, did you happen to know?

617
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:00,800
The person in charge turned out to be from here.

618
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,667
I have a feeling they might want something from her.

619
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:07,433
She wears a scarf and dark sunglasses even in the middle of the night.

620
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,167
Nothing strange is going on with her, right?

621
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,867
   

622
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:23,600
   

623
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,233
Why are you doing this?

624
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:28,267
I'm posting it in the group chat.

625
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:30,333
You need to look for her.

626
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:33,200
Why? Hana-eup is such a small village.

627
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,733
If I just post it here in the group chat…

628
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,600
   

629
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,167
- Rice soup restaurant? 
 - Huh?

630
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:43,067
Someone saw her passed out from drinking at the rice soup restaurant.

631
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:48,767
They say the gangsters took her away.

632
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,567
- What are you doing now? 
 - Just a moment.

633
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,767
She was kidnapped by thugs while drunk,

634
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:54,667
so you shouldn't be making phone calls so casually.

635
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:56,767
Oh yes, sir, it's me, Min Goo.

636
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,733
It's not about anything else.

637
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,400
Kang Hee went over there, right?

638
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,700
Well, then that's enough.

639
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,100
That's not it.

640
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,667
Yes, bye.

641
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,567
Where's Kang Hee now? What's so funny?

642
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:13,667
To think of thugs carrying a drunk Kang Hee into a motel…

643
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,567
It could be funny.

644
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:19,233
Where is this place? Who are you? Are you really a policeman?

645
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,233
Oh, you fool.

646
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:40,067
You clueless fool.

647
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:44,167
You clueless fool.

648
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:48,133
You haven't kept a single promise you made to me.

649
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:51,533
Why did you lose weight?

650
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:54,733
I'll gain weight again.

651
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:57,867
Where did your glasses go?

652
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:00,900
I'll put the glasses back on.

653
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,733
It's okay.

654
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:06,200
You're seeing other women.

655
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:13,067
What about you, then?

656
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,000
 Why do you keep blocking me? 

657
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,167
 - Why? 
 - No… 

658
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,100
 We didn't kidnap her, I'm telling you. 

659
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,860
Then, why did you bring her here?

660
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,767
A bunch of men with one woman…

661
00:49:56,767 --> 00:49:59,000
Give Kang Hee back right now.

662
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,033
Mister, please…

663
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:10,667
If you don't bring Kang Hee out right now, we'll cancel the project, client or whatever.

664
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:16,433
This is Kang Hee's home.

665
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:19,600
How can you say such nonsense?

666
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,367
 I'm not the motel owner's daughter, I just happened to live in a motel. 

667
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,600
 I was born in a motel and grew up in one. 

668
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:33,900
That's right. He is Kang Hee's father.

669
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,333
Hey.

670
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:40,833
What are you talking about?

671
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,700
Then all this time…

672
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,333
My name is Ji Chun Pil, and my daughter is Ji Kang Hee.

673
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:13,500
♫  Stay by my side  ♫ 
♫  Like the rain that always falls  ♫

674
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:27,130
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫ 
♫  Let's chat under the crescent moon  ♫

675
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,933
 You clueless fool. 

676
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:43,233
 You haven't kept a single promise you made to me. 

677
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,800
 You're seeing other women. 

678
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:49,533
Oh my.

679
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,133
   

680
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,200
What?

681
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,433
Am I trapped?

682
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,867
Are you okay, Kang Hee?

683
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:16,067
You're safe, right?

684
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,433
Why are you here now?

685
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:22,033
They say the owner of this motel is your father.

686
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,500
The police didn't do anything.

687
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,467
They say those thugs all live here.

688
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:33,700
You all live here?

689
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,733
Kang Hee, you should have breakfast.

690
00:53:45,733 --> 00:53:47,533
Shall I bring it to your room?

691
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:50,267
It's fine. I'll come down.

692
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:52,233
Get ready and come down.

693
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:16,633
Did you two sleep here?

694
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:20,467
I told you to come sooner, sit here.

695
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,133
Please enjoy your meal.

696
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,667
Thank you.

697
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:35,767
This dried pollack soup is amazing. Try it.

698
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:39,133
Yes, sir.

699
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:41,433
Oh, is that so?

700
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:43,700
Yes, I'll be there now, in a moment.

701
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,233
Please wait a little, yes.

702
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:48,533
Oh my, the vet is going to collapse at this rate.

703
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:51,067
How many times has it been that he ran out in the middle of breakfast?

704
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:52,733
He makes a lot of money, doesn't he?

705
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:56,133
If he wants to make money, it's better to go to Seoul and run an animal hospital.

706
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:58,440
Working as a livestock vet in a rural area

707
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,230
can't be done without a sense of duty.

708
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:02,433
You don't know it well.

709
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:05,667
The work is tough, but he earns so much money.

710
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:09,333
I don't know who it will be, but his future wife is lucky.

711
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:11,900
That doesn't matter to him.

712
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,500
The person who will be his wife is also a vet.

713
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:18,210
I saw them when I went to the restaurant before,

714
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,600
and they looked good together.

715
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:29,567
Now, take your time and eat. Okay?

716
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,867
Let's go.

717
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,700
- I'll get going first. 
 - All right.

718
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,500
Yesterday,

719
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,233
who brought me here?

720
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:19,300
Well, it wasn't me.

721
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,860
What?

722
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,470
What's this?

723
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,900
What are you listening to?

724
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,700
An audiobook.

725
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,233
You've become quite the intellectual since I last saw you.

726
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,067
Ryu Han Woo.

727
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:46,267
Why on earth do you live here?

728
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,900
I said I was going to raise cattle, but I got kicked out of the house.

729
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,733
Weren't you a stockbroker?

730
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:54,900
Life in Seoul was getting tiresome.

731
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,867
Don't you feel the same?

732
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,267
Should I give you more soup?

733
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,100
What happened to you, mister?

734
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,633
Since when did you become so good at cooking?

735
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,733
The lady from FamilyMart closed up the mart and came here.

736
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,667
- Huh? 
 - With Mr. Kwon.

737
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:22,733
With the FamilyMart lady?

738
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:26,867
So, they've become family together?

739
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:29,767
They've become a family, indeed.

740
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:33,000
   

741
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,300
Yeon Soo isn't even here, but what are you looking at so intently?

742
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,433
I'm just enjoying the view.

743
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:48,200
The scenery is really nice here.

744
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,600
I understand why you said you wouldn't come.

745
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,333
But why did you suddenly change your mind about coming?

746
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,433
I've been worried about it all night.

747
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,100
But I found the answer this morning.

748
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,433
The person who will marry Yeon Soo.

749
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,200
You were curious about that person, weren't you?

750
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,267
Don't cross the line. What makes you think you know?

751
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:16,433
Oh, I know well.

752
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:18,300
Because I was like that, too.

753
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,600
When Esther said she got a proposal,

754
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,133
I thought I was going crazy with curiosity.

755
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,333
Eventually, I went to Victor and proposed that we start a business together.

756
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:35,467
Because I wanted to check for myself if he was a good guy or not.

757
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,367
I envy you.

758
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,033
I can't even suggest to the vet to work on the motel construction together.

759
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,500
I don't even have an excuse to go see him.

760
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,680
I'm going to see the dog I left with him.

761
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,460
Do you want to come with me?

762
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:56,133
   

763
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,000
Jeez. It's frustrating, right?

764
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,533
- Oh, it's frustrating, right? 
 - Oh.

765
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,533
It's the director.

766
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,933
 Director. 

767
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:15,800
 Put these on quickly. 

768
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,933
 Oh, thank you. 

769
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:21,367
 Are you sweating? You're soaked in blood. 

770
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:23,633
 I'll do it. It's okay. 

771
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,467
Give it to me. I will take care of it.

772
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:36,767
No, I can carry it.

773
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:39,300
It's okay. Director, please go in and wash up quickly.

774
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,000
Hurry up. It's fine.

775
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,300
Oh, you came?

776
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,767
We came to see the puppy.

777
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:03,500
Thank you for the good treatment.

778
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,467
Give your thanks to Ms. Yoon over there.

779
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:09,300
Because Ms. Yoon took such good care, the recovery was fast.

780
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:11,900
Kkam Hee.

781
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,220
Oh, Dad has had a hard time,

782
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,067
so Kkam Hee, why don't you comfort him?

783
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:18,467
Kkam Hee?

784
01:00:18,467 --> 01:00:20,700
Kkam Hee, Kang Hee, Kang Hee, Kkam Hee.

785
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,600
Ms. Kang Hee, his name is Kkam Hee.

786
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,633
I'll get going.

787
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,867
We'll get going.

788
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:45,167
- Yes, go ahead. 
 - Kkam Hee, goodbye.

789
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,200
Oh, are you okay?

790
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,800
Oh no.

791
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,967
Those two look good together.

792
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,967
Especially Ms. Yoon is incredibly kind to Yeon Soo.

793
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,067
Now you feel relieved, right?

794
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:02,733
Manager.

795
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,433
You haven't dated before, right?

796
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,533
What are you talking about? Do you know how popular I am?

797
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,433
You've never...

798
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,933
truly liked anyone. Right?

799
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,500
The plumbing work is taking longer than expected.

800
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,533
I'll meet the deadline, so don't worry.

801
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,467
   

802
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,767
Oh, you startled me!

803
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,167
Ice cream? You don't usually eat ice cream.

804
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,867
Please buy me that.

805
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,300
I also like ice cream.

806
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,867
Okay, then.

807
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:39,000
Yay, ice cream!

808
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,067
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

809
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:42,300
Wow, that looks delicious.

810
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,600
Director, what would you like to have?

811
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,233
- I'll take one of these in the family size. 
 - Okay.

812
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:48,933
With this one?

813
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,267
A provocative flavor?

814
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:54,100
Why are you like this?

815
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:57,400
I want to eat it all.

816
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,267
 How did you know? 

817
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:04,667
 How do you always suggest getting ice cream whenever I feel like this? 

818
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,200
 I just know because I'm always looking at you. 

819
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,467
 Don't look at me. 

820
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,500
 Don't look at me. Just look ahead. 

821
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,900
 I said don't look at me. Don't move. 

822
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,710
 If you move, you're dead to me. 

823
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:33,110
♫  ...has grown even larger since yesterday  ♫

824
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:44,290
♫  My shy, hesitant first words to you  ♫

825
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:47,960
♫  Those seemingly meaningless words contained my feelings for you  ♫

826
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,233
I'll have the chocolate flavor, please.

827
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:52,267
Yes, I'll help you with the payment first.

828
01:03:52,267 --> 01:03:54,233
Please wrap it separately.

829
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,767
You punk.

830
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,700
You punk.

831
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,700
You punk.

832
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,433
Who's the punk you're talking about?

833
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:34,200
♫  My clumsy confession to you  ♫

834
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:40,890
♫  They are more precious than they were yesterday ♫  

835
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:47,567
Kang Hee, why are you crying?

836
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,367
You changed,

837
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,533
you've really changed.

838
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:04,140
♫  I may not have said "I love you"  ♫

839
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:10,300
    
 ♫  But it was all love  ♫

840
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:19,770
♫  These things still make me nervous  ♫

841
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:24,020
♫  But would you take my hands and embrace me?  ♫

842
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,600
   

843
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,710
 First love, the end. 

844
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,380
 You acted so confident, Kang Hee. 

845
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,320
 Can I ask you something? It's an important question. 

846
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,060
 Starting today, we... 

847
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:40,840
 I'm not the only one who can comfort Kang Hee anymore. 

848
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,550
 I hate men who know my past the most. 

849
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,740
 You know all about my dark past and my wounds. 

850
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,290
 You should've just kept going, pretended you didn't see anything. 

851
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:56,020
 Who are you to me, even? Answer me! 

852
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,470
 Why do you keep doing this to me? 

853
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:02,900
 Cheon Yeon Soo, do you like me?
