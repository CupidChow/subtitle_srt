00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:21,900
<i>[Final Episode]</i>

2
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:16,867
Say something, Kang Hee.

3
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,433
- I'm hungry.
- Huh?

4
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,100
I couldn't eat anything all day, so I'm hungry.

5
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,500
Try it.

6
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,700
What?

7
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,333
Do I look pathetic?

8
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:08,833
Are you alright?

9
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,900
Of course.

10
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,167
I'm a person who values cost-effectiveness,
so once I'm full, that's it.

11
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,700
If you don't eat, I'll eat it all.

12
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,067
Slow down.

13
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,667
If you're sad, just cry.

14
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,133
It's okay to cry.

15
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,067
I'm not sad.

16
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,100
It's because I feel sorry for Chun Pil.

17
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,667
He confessed that he had a terminal illness,

18
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,800
but his so-called daughter

19
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,200
just kept eating, saying she's hungry.

20
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,533
This is the pollack roe

21
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,967
that Chun Pil sent me.

22
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Ah Reum brought it here, but actually,

23
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,567
Chun Pil is the one who sent it to me.

24
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,967
Gamtae seaweed,

25
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,967
frozen beef bone soup,

26
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:56,367
fist-sized diced radish kimchi, radish
water kimchi, he sent all of these to me.

27
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,600
He thinks I don't know, but…

28
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,333
I know everything.

29
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,500
Even though I knew, I pretended not to,

30
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:09,867
or rather, acted like it was nothing,

31
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,233
and never once thanked him.

32
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,500
How long does Chun Pil have?

33
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,933
Huh?

34
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,600
How long does Chun Pil have?

35
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,267
On graduation day,

36
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:20,033
Chun Pil wanted to take
a photo with me, but I didn't…

37
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:24,933
I should have taken it.

38
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,900
He said he wanted to see how I live,

39
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,233
but I told him it wasn't possible…

40
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,700
I should have told him to come in.

41
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,267
I told him that I found it bothersome

42
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:55,000
and didn't want to see him every Christmas.

43
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,467
When we meet,

44
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,533
he called me, saying, 'Kang Hee, Kang Hee!'

45
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,233
I was embarrassed by his loud voice,

46
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,133
and I didn't want to see that either.

47
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:16,767
I also hated seeing him come every year,
trying to look stylish by switching hats.

48
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,667
Chun Pil always seemed like

49
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,467
he would be a nuisance,

50
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,567
constantly by my side, but…

51
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:35,233
What will I do if Chun Pil
really dies, Yeon Soo?

52
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,633
That foolish Chun Pil,

53
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,267
he's such a scaredy-cat.

54
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:53,233
How frightened must he have been alone?

55
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:08,033
Please tell me that Chun Pil
isn't dying because of me,

56
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,633
that he's not sick because of me.

57
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,767
It's not because of you.

58
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,233
Please tell me that

59
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,833
Chun Pil won't die, leaving only me behind.

60
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,833
Teddy bear.

61
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,167
Why are you crying?

62
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,900
Please tell me that if something
happens to Chun Pil,

63
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,567
you'll be by my side.

64
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Nothing will happen to him

65
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,300
and I'll always be by your side.

66
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,367
Why did you wake up? You
should be sleeping deeply.

67
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,767
Let's go, I'll put you back to sleep.

68
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,867
When I left Hana-eup,

69
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:04,533
I promised myself I'd
never live like Mr. Chun Pil.

70
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,433
But even on the day off from the construction
site, with patches all over my body,

71
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,500
I still insisted on going to
the movie theater to watch a film

72
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,133
and to the museum to see the exhibition.

73
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:23,633
I said that he was just trying to look cool,
and I was gossiping about Chun Pil.

74
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,800
If you want to talk about him,
I'll always listen, Kang Hee.

75
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
Even if I keep talking about him?

76
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,067
Sure.

77
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:37,500
I'll listen to you, even if
you keep talking about him.

78
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,700
Even if I never saw him again in my life,

79
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,167
I thought I'd be okay.

80
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,767
Why do I regret the days I didn't see him?

81
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,767
Yeon Soo.

82
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,867
How long are you going to keep regretting?

83
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,133
You can see him from now on.

84
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,233
That's right.

85
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,233
Yeon Soo, by the way,

86
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,400
how do you always say
the right thing every time?

87
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,300
Do you know the answer?

88
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,300
And how do you say things so nicely?

89
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,067
I never think of it like that.

90
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,567
How about becoming a bit more simple?

91
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,533
When you live worrying about too many things,

92
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,267
you miss out on things.

93
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,233
I see.

94
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,467
Alright.

95
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,333
Just simply.

96
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,233
Oh, it's our Seung Eon.

97
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,633
From now on,

98
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,633
I'll be your guardian.

99
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,633
You want to be my guardian?

100
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,033
Seung Eon, there's somewhere
I need to go with you.

101
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,967
I have somewhere to go.

102
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,700
It's this way.

103
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,833
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

104
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,767
I came to apply for adoption.

105
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,633
It's an adult adoption.

106
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:07,367
And I'm the adoptive father,
and he's the adoptee.

107
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,933
Do you have a spouse?

108
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,333
No, I don't.

109
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,700
Then you need to fill out the paperwork first.

110
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,500
Hello.

111
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,100
It's all done, now.

112
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
Mister.

113
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,167
Let's go get some jjajangmyeon with Dad.

114
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,567
Huh?

115
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>[Motel California]</i>

116
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,733
Thank you

117
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,533
for taking care of Chun Pil all this time.

118
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,367
I'm sorry.

119
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
It must have been tough

120
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,367
handling it all by yourself, right?

121
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,567
If you don't tell me what's going on with him,

122
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,167
you'll be in trouble.

123
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,333
Alright.

124
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,700
Where is Chun Pil?

125
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,800
He's resting.

126
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,033
Chun Pil, are you inside?

127
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,133
Yes.

128
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,133
What are you doing?

129
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,933
Oh, now?

130
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,500
I'm trying to organize this and that.

131
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,300
Why? Did the doctor say you're going to die?

132
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,167
Come on, even if the doctor
doesn't tell me that, I know it.

133
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,267
Jeez!

134
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,000
Alright, alright.

135
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,233
I feel good getting attention from you.

136
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,800
I should have told you
earlier that I was in pain.

137
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
And I should've pretended
to be a little sicker.

138
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:12,867
I heard chemotherapy is really tough.

139
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,433
I'll go with you some time.

140
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,367
Really?

141
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,033
Then,

142
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,700
take a number and wait.

143
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,100
There's a long line of people
who want to go with me.

144
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,967
Just…

145
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,167
Just keep living as you normally do.

146
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,500
You live your life, and I'll live mine.

147
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,900
That's all you can do.

148
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,967
Don't worry.

149
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,133
Don't act all high and mighty
when you're the one who's sick.

150
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,567
If you want to date her, go ahead.

151
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,133
Who?

152
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,533
CEO Hwang Jeong Gu.

153
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,067
Oh, my.

154
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,800
That was funny.

155
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,533
Should I call her?

156
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:20,367
Finally, my daughter Kang Hee
has permitted our relationship.

157
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,967
With a rose in my mouth,
should I give her a call?

158
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,333
Oh, come on! It's annoying.

159
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,167
Chun Pil, Chun Pil.

160
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,967
Chun Pil.

161
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,433
Chun Pil.

162
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,000
Chun Pil, what do I do?

163
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:07,167
What will I do without you, Chun Pil?

164
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,033
You are like

165
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:13,200
my real family.

166
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,500
It's okay. I'm not going to die right away.

167
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't worry.

168
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,133
Oh, I'm…

169
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,100
I'm Lee Mok Won.

170
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,500
I've heard a lot about you from Su Ji.

171
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,367
Yes, you are fashion president
from Cheongwon, right?

172
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,733
I've heard about you indirectly,
nice to meet you.

173
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,200
Chun Pil, what do I do?

174
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
May I call you brother?

175
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,267
Yes, as you wish.

176
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,400
Su Ji.

177
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,367
Have a talk and come out.
I'll get some fresh air outside.

178
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:48,067
Hey, sit down.

179
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,400
Hey, this is the first time I've seen someone

180
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,267
you've dated who actually
has a proper business card.

181
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:03,133
Thank you very much, Su Ji.

182
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,867
Of course, you'd be thankful.

183
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:11,233
Aren't you glad you listened to me?

184
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,600
I mean, insurance!

185
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,933
I kept insisting that you get this
insurance, and that insurance, remember?

186
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,933
You were so nice and
listened to everything I said.

187
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:24,200
Yes, that's right, Su Ji. Thanks to you,
I don't have to worry about hospital bills.

188
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,300
Oh no, why do you take money
from the insurance company?

189
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,867
You need to be healthy!

190
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,967
If something happens to you,

191
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:34,600
I will follow right after you,
so take care of yourself.

192
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,533
Alright, alright.

193
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,200
Ms. Hwang.

194
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,567
You should have informed us in advance.

195
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:56,300
Today, I'm not CEO Hwang from Golden Gilt,
but I've come as Chun Pil's hospital mate.

196
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,000
Shall we talk together?

197
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:10,067
Should I be mentally prepared?

198
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:13,567
Kang Hee, Korea's medical
technology is top-notch.

199
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,900
If he has the will to live, he can get better.

200
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,967
I did, and so did Chun Pil.

201
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,833
He'll definitely overcome it this time as well.

202
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Kang Hee.

203
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,667
I don't have to worry about you, and
I can still be his hospital mate, right?

204
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,700
Thank you, Ms. Hwang.

205
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,667
I'll continue to ask for your
care and support for him.

206
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,133
Yeon Soo.

207
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,967
Shall I dry your hair?

208
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,067
- Yes.
- Then I'll dry your hair.

209
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,167
How can you dry it without fingers?

210
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,500
Like this.

211
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,667
Isn't it hot?

212
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,033
It feels good. I wish you could
dry my hair like this every day.

213
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,500
I'll dry it every day.

214
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,833
- Really?
- Yes.

215
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,233
Then next time, I'll dry your hair.

216
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,333
Alright.

217
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,033
Is it done?

218
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,500
- It looks good, sir.
- Thank you.

219
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Did you check out the nursing home properly?

220
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:33,967
Yes.

221
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:39,000
But I don't want to send
Mr. Chun Pil to the nursing home.

222
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,233
Motel California without
Mr. Chun Pil feels too weird.

223
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,200
I feel the same.

224
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
Let's try to dissuade him from
going to the nursing home.

225
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:50,833
We are all here, so there
is no reason to go there.

226
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:54,200
I feel like he's rushing because of us.

227
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,367
I think he doesn't want to burden us.

228
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,133
Isn't there another way?

229
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,200
Alright.

230
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,967
Seung Eon.

231
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,633
Didn't you review the lesson from last time?

232
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:18,067
I did, but I couldn't remember it.

233
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:22,000
You can memorize all the poems I wrote,
but you couldn't memorize this book?

234
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,267
That's because you recorded them all.

235
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:29,167
Shall I record this book for you as well?

236
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,600
- Really?
- Yes.

237
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,067
Then I'd appreciate it.

238
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,967
Cha Seung Eon.

239
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,467
Don't give up, understand?

240
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,933
Answer me.

241
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,767
Yes.

242
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,467
Next chapter.

243
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,200
Ah Reum.

244
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,233
What is it?

245
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,800
Hand cream, you said you ran out last time.

246
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,936
Thank you.

247
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,100
Apply it for me.

248
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,533
No, it's okay.

249
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Give me your hand!

250
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:24,867
A bit here, a bit there.

251
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,833
Your hands are really small.

252
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,400
What's going on?

253
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
Because of you…

254
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:52,967
Did you see that?

255
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,067
It was like…

256
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:59,500
It was an atmosphere where beauty, excitement,
and pheromones were all mixed together.

257
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,533
Is holding hands like this

258
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:04,067
really supposed to be so erotic?

259
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,933
Let's try harder, too.

260
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,200
What?

261
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,000
Follow me.

262
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,200
Are you going to do this?

263
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,567
She perks her ears up and reacts
very well to the surrounding noise.

264
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:34,033
I don't see any lameness now, so
it seems everything is okay now.

265
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,333
That's a relief, right?

266
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,033
What are they doing?

267
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,300
Hey, hey, hey.

268
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
We're not like that. Don't get the wrong idea.

269
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,833
What do you mean by that?

270
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:03,767
We were just naming the donkey…

271
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,400
- I didn't ask.
- We're really nothing.

272
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
Yeah, right, so…

273
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Just finish what you were doing.

274
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,133
- Go for it!
- I really mean it.

275
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,667
Senior.

276
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:26,333
We're really nothing?

277
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:30,200
No, it's not that…

278
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,200
Let's just go now.

279
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,067
Wait.

280
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,100
Ms. Nan Woo.

281
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:42,233
Can I confess?

282
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,400
What? You said you wouldn't wear this.

283
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,800
No way, you gave it to me.

284
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:07,567
You still have this?

285
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,500
Of course, you gave it to me.

286
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,100
Find the most appropriate one, okay?

287
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,700
Do I have to see it here, then?

288
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

289
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,267
What? Red, blue… You two look
like the Korean flag. So tacky.

290
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,633
- Until the East sea dries and Mt. Beakdu wears.
- Until the East sea dries and Mt. Beakdu wears.

291
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,333
Kang Hee, didn't you see something really
weird at the animal hospital yesterday?

292
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,833
- The donkey?
- No, no.

293
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,733
Something even weirder than that.

294
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,633
Couples?

295
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:47,800
Yeon Soo, who gave Ah Reum
the hand cream yesterday?

296
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,300
He didn't give it to her.

297
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,433
- He applied it to her.
- He applied it to her.

298
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,400
Oh, what are you talking about?

299
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,067
Now that I look at it, the color
of your scarf is really pretty.

300
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,367
Have a good date, I'm sorry.

301
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:00,733
Alright.

302
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,533
Yeah.

303
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,533
Did they get something on you?

304
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,900
No? What about you?

305
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:12,967
What?

306
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:18,700
Let's have some potatoes, grilled squid,

307
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,300
and also buy sweet potato
sticks at the rest area.

308
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,400
Can you eat all of them?

309
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,433
Yes.

310
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,233
<i>[Cloud Farm]</i>

311
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,367
Yes, hello.

312
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,133
Oh, is she unable to walk
because she collapsed?

313
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,033
It hasn't been long since
she gave birth, right?

314
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:43,367
Yes, I'll go now, yes.

315
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,067
What are you doing? Go quickly.

316
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,133
I'll contact you when it's
done, see you in Seoul.

317
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:53,300
Don't overdo it, and give me a call.

318
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,700
Get back safely.

319
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,767
I'll honestly tell you why I got divorced.

320
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,833
Truly, he was an unparalleled con artist.

321
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:22,367
From the beginning, he approached
me for my money, not for me.

322
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,867
It seems like you have a similar pain to mine.

323
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,700
I know that feeling of betrayal very well.

324
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,200
It's fortunate that you found
out before having a child.

325
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,867
I'm pregnant.

326
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:34,933
What? No way.

327
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,200
Sorry, I'm sorry.

328
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,933
I've lived in the U.S. for a long time.

329
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Anyway, so…

330
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,233
Open-minded.

331
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,567
- Take care.
- Yes.

332
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,900
Manager, where are you?

333
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,800
Kang Hee, sorry. How was the meeting?

334
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,100
How can you arrange
the meeting and then skip it?

335
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,600
Did you forget the meeting time?

336
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,300
I can't leave because I have
something important right now.

337
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,800
Can you come over here, Kang Hee?

338
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,100
What's the matter?

339
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,333
- Esther is now…
- Okay.

340
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,133
Then, have a great day.

341
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,467
Bye.

342
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:20,600
Got to go, Kang Hee.

343
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,333
I'll call you later.

344
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,333
Hey.

345
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,467
How could you send him away
without introducing him to me?

346
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,833
- It's a no.
- Why? Don't you like him?

347
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:34,533
He was babbling in English, and he
reminded me a lot of that rat Victor.

348
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:36,267
That's not okay. Disqualified.

349
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:40,600
Oh, then what kind of man
should you meet next time?

350
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,900
Lawyer, Kim Seong Cheol.

351
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,133
How about this person?

352
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,567
I don't think I need to meet him.

353
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,933
What? Not good again?

354
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,833
Thanks to someone, my
self-esteem has skyrocketed.

355
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:58,000
I think I can raise my baby well on my own.

356
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,367
You'll help me, right?

357
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:03,967
Of course, I'm the godfather.

358
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:08,167
Even if you don't, Little Heart
will really like me.

359
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,200
Wait and see.

360
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,100
Okay.

361
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,633
Are you done? Will you come?

362
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:42,600
What?

363
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,800
Got it, I'll go right away.

364
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,000
Is he selling the motel?

365
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
People trying to buy the motel were coming
in and out, causing a real commotion.

366
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,567
Mr. Kwon, what does this mean?

367
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,267
There's a letter from the boss.

368
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:16,433
A letter?

369
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,767
Hello?

370
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:32,000
<i>This is Ji Chun Pil, the manager
of Motel California.</i>

371
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:36,767
<i>The Motel California, which
has warmly embraced us</i>

372
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:41,467
<i>until now, is about to leave our embrace.</i>

373
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:47,800
However, its spirit will remain and is
expected to transfer into my bank account.

374
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:51,567
I understand that this can be very perplexing.

375
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,367
It can't be helped.

376
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,467
Now, you'll each leave the motel

377
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:00,467
and find your own homes.

378
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,133
'Once you decide on a place, come and find me.'

379
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:07,133
'Whether you need a loan, I'll give you.'

380
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,300
It's something I could have never imagined.

381
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,300
Me too.

382
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Me too.

383
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,067
Me too.

384
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,433
There are so many memories here.

385
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:46,833
<i>Alright.</i>

386
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,767
<i>Hold on.</i>

387
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,433
<i>Suddenly?</i>

388
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,867
<i>In about a year, you will grow this tall.</i>

389
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,333
<i>Right?</i>

390
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:45,600
<i>Mom.</i>

391
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,767
<i>- Will you help me?
- Yes.</i>

392
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:48,933
<i>It must be heavy.</i>

393
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,767
<i>Here it is.</i>

394
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,733
<i>Let's make it more beautiful.</i>

395
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,333
<i>Wow.</i>

396
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,667
<i>It's so pretty.</i>

397
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:04,533

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,833
<i>Me too.</i>

407

<i>Hey, won't you stop there?</i>

408

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,867
Oh, come in.

411
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:37,233
Excuse me, let me take a quick look.

412
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,733
This room is big, and it even has a terrace.

413
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,567
This is exactly what Mr. Park was looking for.

414
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:45,767
Break the bathroom to install a glass wall.

415
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,433
No, no.

416
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,600
I need to split this room in half.

417
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,033
Why would I need a terrace?

418
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,833
People come to a motel
to sleep, not to sightsee.

419
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,433
Please leave.

420
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:58,367
- What's the matter?
- Ah, I'm telling you to leave.

421
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,533
- Are you the boss?
- I'm asking if you're the boss.

422
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,900
- I'm telling you to leave.
- Okay, I'm going.

423
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,967
I'll go, jeez.

424
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,800
The price is a bit high.

425
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,667
The price is one thing, but why
does a motel need such a space?

426
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,900
This is a serious waste of space, overall.

427
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,467
How much will it cost to renovate all of this?

428
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,800
If it's not us, no one
else will buy this motel.

429
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,333
Please leave.

430
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,667
The price a bit…

431
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,267
Please leave.

432
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,933
It seems like the owner…

439
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,133
It turns out he really was sick.

How do I look?

441
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,933
Does my smile look natural?

442
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,733
Yes.

443
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:14,667
What about my voice? Is it okay?

444
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:16,267
Yes.

445
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:23,100
I'll be back.

Are you having a hard time?

447
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,300
Yes, I'm seeing things. There
was definitely a nurse earlier.

448
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,667
I can see my daughter in front of me.

449
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,567
It's me.

450
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,000
I'll stay for just one night.

451
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,467
I've seen your face, that's enough, go.

452
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:27,833
I came because I have something to ask.

453
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:35,733
Motel California is like a part of you.

454
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:37,367
Why do you suddenly want to sell it?

455
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:11,200
<i>May I ask the reason?</i>

456
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,433
<i>Because I'm scared.</i>

<i>Pardon?</i>

458
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:25,200

460
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:33,700
<i>I might get obsessed.</i>

461
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:44,900
<i>And while letting someone
take care of my illness,</i>

462
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:48,567
<i>I'm afraid I might want to live.</i>

463
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,600

464
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,667

<i>I have to clear it out, cleanly.</i>

469
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,033
Can't you not sell it?

470
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:37,433
It's hard to take care of my own body.

471
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:38,867
It's cumbersome.

472
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,067
Then give it to me.

473
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:43,567
You were going to give it to
me when you died anyway.

474
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:44,733
Give it to me in advance.

475

I can change it.

477
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,100
I have things to do there.

What will you do?

479
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,133
In the future,

480
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,333
I'll have a daughter who resembles me.

00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,533
Are you pregnant?

482
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,833
I said in the future.

If it's a daughter who resembles me,

484
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:09,033
I can't raise her alone, you
need to help raise her.

485
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:11,900
You've raised me, Chun Pil.

486
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,400
You did a good job.

487
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,867
- I'll build a nursing home.
- Huh?

488
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:27,967
Looking at you, it looks like you need that.

489
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,233
No, what's the use of having
an interior design expert as a daughter?

490
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,700
You should use her skills in such times.

Chun Pil.

492
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,733

I convinced Chun Pil.

499
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:00,267
I told Chun Pil that I would
make our house beautiful

500
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:04,133
so he would want to live a long, long life,

501
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,033
and he said he'd think about it.

502
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,533
Then it's settled.

503
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:11,433

What do you mean 'no way'?

511
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,233
How can I beat you?

512
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:30,367
What do you mean by that?

513
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:31,433
You always win.

514
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:32,900

00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,700
Seung Eon.

539
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:11,700
I'm his son.

540
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,700
The government acknowledged it.

541
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,767
Yes, that's right.

542
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:19,767
So…

543
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:23,533
Whatever you do, let's do it together.

544
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,667
You are reliable, my brother.

545
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,533
My birthday is earlier than yours, you know?

546
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,267
So?

547
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:35,667
Even so, I'm still younger.

548
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,400
Say 'sister'.

549
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:41,067
- Sister.
- Ah, I don't want to.

550
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,200
Good night, little brother.

551
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,533
Good night, little brother.

552
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,433
Good night.

553
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,000
Sister.

554
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:53,867
Goodbye.

555
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:20,667
Kang Hee, drink while you work.

556
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,333
- Thank you.
- Go for it.

557
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,533
Go for it.

558
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,833
The lawn is laid, and
the furniture has arrived.

559
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,633
The construction is finally over.

560
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,433
So is the official relationship over too?

561
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,200
Wasn't it over already?

562
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,067
You didn't even come to Hana-eup for a while.

563
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:40,367
I admit it. I apologize.

564
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,200
Thank you for the quick apology.

565
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:45,867
I have a confession.

566
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:49,733
I thought you were using me.

567
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,100
But looking back,

568
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:55,367
I was the one using you.

569
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:58,300
I already knew.

570
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,900
From the beginning.

571
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,067
From the beginning?

572
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,700
I can see everything from the side.

573
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,033
Only the two of you don't know.

574
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:06,867
- Really?
- Yes.

575
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:10,633
I bet even Little Heart knows by now.

576
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:12,767
That you two like each other.

577
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,667
Oh, so that's why your
heart wasn't swayed by me.

578
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,833
No wonder.

579
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,367
I know that your feelings for me were genuine.

580
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:28,500
Thank you for treating me well all this time.

581
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,433
I don't know if I'll
continue to treat you well.

582
00:50:34,433 --> 00:50:36,500
I'll keep the promise I made to you.

583
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,533
The promise to have a grand opening ceremony.

584
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,933
The decoration team will come.

585
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:43,667
And there will be an on-site buffet.

586
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:47,733
We'll gather all the villagers
and make it grand.

587
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:51,000
Then can I hold an event there?

588
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,700
Of course, do whatever you want.

589
00:50:57,933 --> 00:50:59,467
- Alright.
- When can I open my eyes?

590
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:01,100
- You can open your eyes soon.
- Got it.

591
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,967
- You're going forward.
- Yes.

592
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:08,233
Open your eyes now.

593
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,533
- Am I opening my eyes now?
- Yes.

594
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,033
Wow.

595
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,633
Wow, it's pretty.

596
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,567
I wanted to show you first.

597
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:32,733
I'm touched.

598
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:35,467
He must really like it.

599
00:51:36,933 --> 00:51:38,200
I'm excited.

600
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,333
Me too.

601
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeon Soo.

602
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,800
Tomorrow is really important to me, right?

603
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,667
That I didn't live a wasted life in Seoul.

604
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:55,133
That I am not the daughter
dragging down Mr. Chun Pil.

605
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:58,100
I really want to show everyone.

606
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,467
It will be like that.

607
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:07,067
Alright.

608
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:10,667
I'm proud of you, Ji Kang Hee.

609
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,133
I'm proud of you.

610
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:22,067
Isn't he crying because he's proud of you?

611
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:25,767
I'm going to do a presentation about
the nursing home to Mr. Chun Pil.

612
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,667
Then, have you finished the design?

613
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,533
Yeah, should I show you?

614
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,500
- Close your eyes again.
- Again?

615
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,333
- This time, I'll jump.
- Got it.

616
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,300
Alright.

617
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:39,867
Jump!

618
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,467
Hey, I'm scared, I'm scared.

619
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:44,633
Another one, another one.

620
00:52:44,633 --> 00:52:46,567
Another one, one more.

621
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:48,400
One more, one more.

622
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,633
One more, we are almost there.

623
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,767
Now, one more!

624
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:52,833
Since when did you open your eyes?

625
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:55,000
- From the beginning.
- What?

626
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:58,067
Wow, are we doing it here?

627
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,067
Yes.

628
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:01,100
<i>[O-tel Hana]</i>

629
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,567
Ta-da!

630
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:05,800
Alright, from now on,

631
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,033
I, Ji Kang Hee, will now lead the PT.

632
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,300
Yes, understood.

633
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,167
Oh, this is nice.

634
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:35,700
<i>[O-tel Hana]</i>

635
00:53:40,433 --> 00:53:42,400
Alright, let's start the rehearsal.

636
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,067
For now, don't actually cut
it, but just pretend to cut.

637
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:47,833
So, it's not tape, but cutting the air.

638
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:50,967
We'll do the actual cutting
when the client arrives.

639
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:52,600
But why are we doing a rehearsal?

640
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,867
We need to practice.

641
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:58,067
One, two, three.

642
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,300
Like this.

643
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,333
You're cool, Ji Kang Hee.

644
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,467
Looking good, O-tel Hana.

645
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:09,400
Great, please show the same
enthusiasm during the main event.

646
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
I also prepared fireworks.

647
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,000
Kang Hee, can we throw confetti?

648
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,067
Sure.

649
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,700
Yeah.

650
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:22,733
Huh?

651
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,000
No.

652
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:33,767
Mr. Chun Pil can't come.

653
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,833
Should we postpone?

654
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,167
He told us to do it by ourselves.

655
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:44,400
Gosh, I don't understand. You go
there. You guys wanted that, right?

656
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,333
Why is everyone gathered here?

657
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:50,633
If you go there, they provide a buffet too,

658
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:52,267
and they give out coupons and all.

659
00:54:52,267 --> 00:54:54,600
Oh, it must be nice.

660
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,933
So go.

661
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:58,067
It looks better than the hotel
in the neighboring town.

662
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:01,233
Right, the whole neighborhood
has brightened up.

663
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:03,767
It's the landmark of our Hana-eup.

664
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,367
That's right.

665
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:08,933
Oh, Kang Hee.

666
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:10,400
Why are you here? Aren't
you attending the event?

667
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,433
Hurry and go attend the event.

668
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:14,300
You're the main character today.

669
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,300
Right, we'll take care of him,

670
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,467
so hurry and go.

671
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:23,067
Oh, you raised your daughter well.

672
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:25,767
Yeah, she's been diligent since she was young.

673
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:27,433
Right, right.

674
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,067
- So diligent.
- So smart.

675
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:36,067
Thank you.

676
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:40,567
In the future, please
come often to visit Chun Pil.

677
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:41,833
Of course.

678
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,133
Don't worry.

679
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,567
Oh my.

680
00:55:56,933 --> 00:56:00,700
I went to see Chun Pil, but
the village elders were there.

681
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,367
So I thanked them and asked
them to take care of him.

682
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,567
Like you said.

683
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,333
Well done.

684
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,167
Oh my, so pretty.

685
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:19,133
You did great.

686
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:21,967
But we're late.

687
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:23,067
Where to?

688
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:36,933
Oh, are you here, manager?

689
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,867
I'll go upstairs and come back.

690
00:56:59,467 --> 00:57:01,667
Here, I brought the main character.

691
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:17,800
Hey guys, what are you doing? Kang Hee is here.

692
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:19,933
Didn't you have something to say?

693
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:25,567
- Go.
- Let's go.

694
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:34,133
Ji Kang Hee, you look quite cool.

695
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:38,533
A rooftop pool in Hana-eup, that's amazing.

696
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:43,067
I'm a country bumpkin, so I've never
seen anything like this. It's huge.

697
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:47,667
I always knew you would succeed.

698
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:48,800
Honestly…

699
00:57:57,633 --> 00:57:58,667
Hey, let's eat.

700
00:58:02,933 --> 00:58:05,633
I heard the news about Mr. Ji.

701
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:09,233
But don't worry too much about it.

702
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:13,433
My father had cancer too, but
after surgery, he's perfectly fine.

703
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:14,633
Don't worry about things like that.

704
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:18,467
If you really want to run
the nursing home… I'll invest.

705
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:20,933
No, not investing. I'll donate.

706
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:23,333
What? Why are you acting
like this all of a sudden?

707
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,333
I'm afraid I might get struck by lightning.

708
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,933
Honestly, I did bully you.

709
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:32,933
But you bullied me a lot too, right?

710
00:58:32,933 --> 00:58:35,700
Like, flying kicks and striking like lightning.

711
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:38,300
Anyway,

712
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,367
I'm sorry, Kang Hee.

713
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:50,300
It's too late, but I'll apologize too.

714
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:52,167
I'm sorry.

715
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:58,667
Sorry.

716
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:02,500
Kang Hee, I'm really sorry.

717
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:06,833
I'm less sorry.

718
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:09,267
Instead, I'll help you with a talent donation.

719
00:59:09,267 --> 00:59:11,867
Before I became a police officer, my
dream was to be a recreation instructor.

720
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,000
I even have a certification.

721
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,433
You should have ended it as a dream.

722
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,200
And me too…

723
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,033
If you have any questions or need anything
while running the nursing home, let me know.

724
00:59:21,033 --> 00:59:24,500
Tell me anytime, then I'll do whatever I can.

725
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,900
Because we're friends.

726
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,267
What, why are you all like this?

727
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:40,100
Hey, I came to remodel the motel.

728
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:45,667
I didn't know I'd remodel my life too.

729
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,633
Oh, seriously stop it, everyone.

730
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,233
- Should I hug you?
- Is Kang Hee crying?

731
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:56,300
No.

732
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,267
- Are you crying?
- What's wrong? Gross.

733
00:59:58,267 --> 00:59:59,400
Look at your face.

734
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,467
Looks like everything's resolved.

735
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:06,500
Look at the eyes, look at the eyes.

736
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:09,100
Just hug Yeon Soo for now.

737
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,167
So what?

738
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:12,900

Are you alright?

754
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,933
What's going on?

755
01:01:13,433 --> 01:01:14,633
Are you okay?

756
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:16,433
Kwon, what's wrong with this?

757
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:18,433
- Ah, yes.
- It's your responsibility.

758
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:19,900
Merry Christmas.

759
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,133
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

760
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:24,967
You should blow.

761
01:01:29,433 --> 01:01:31,400
Oh, thank you, these little munchkins.

762
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,300
These little things suddenly grew
up and became bigger than me.

763
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,033
Thank you, everyone

764
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,067
for giving me such precious gifts.

765
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:42,867
I will never forget this forever.

766
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:47,300
I will live long and happily remember this day.

767
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,800
Kwon, thank you.

768
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:52,333
Yeon Soo as well.

769
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,500
Ah Reum.

770
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,033
Our Han Woo, oh, looks good.

771
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,533
My son.

772
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,467
Our Seung Eon, thank you.

773
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:07,767
And also my daughter.

774
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,633
Why did you give such a precious gift to me?

775
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:14,667
What am I supposed to do?

776
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,000
Jeez.

777
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,767
Dad,

778
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,433
I love you.

779
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:39,433
Don't get sick, don't die.

780
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,133
And live long and healthy.

781
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,633
Let's live happily, joyfully,

782
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:49,067
and excitedly with me.

783
01:02:54,933 --> 01:02:56,733
Enough, enough!

784
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:58,833
Oh, I got goosebumps too.

785
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,567
It's snow!

786
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,067
- Wow.
- Wow.

787
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:05,700
White Christmas!

788
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,733
- White Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

789
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,367
- Kwon.
- Yes.

790
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:18,133
On snowy days, we have
to eat rice cake ramyeon.

791
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,533
- I'll prepare it.
- Rice cake ramyeon, deal?

792
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,600
It's been a long time, catching snow together.

793
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:43,667
Ji Kang Hee, do you know that?

794
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,233
What?

795
01:03:45,233 --> 01:03:47,733
They say if you eat first snow ten
times, you'll be with your first love.

796
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,700
Really?

797
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,700
That's…

798
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,200
I lied to you about that.

799
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,000
So what if it's a lie?

800
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,967
It came true.

801
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:07,767
Is it so?

802
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,533
Six times.

803
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:45,933
Ten times, all eaten!

804
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,367
Ugh, fool.

805
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,633
<i>I wish I had my own room.</i>

806
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:04,433
<i>Your house has many rooms.</i>

807
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,433
<i>Not that kind of room.</i>

808
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:10,967
<i>When I grow up, I'm going
to live in a house like this.</i>

809
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:15,700
<i>A house with a room, a living room,</i>

810
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:19,600
<i>a kitchen, and a yard.</i>

811
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,400
<i>I'll build it for you.</i>

812
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,767
Just like you used to do,

813
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:31,900
I won't go anywhere,

814
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,467
and I'll stay close to you.

815
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,367
I love you.

816
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:48,233
I love you.

817
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,967
Okay, I'm going to take it.

818
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:17,267
- Motel California!
- California!

819
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:18,733
Go for it!

820
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:27,733
Oh, cell phone, cell phone.

821
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,100
On your forehead!

822
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,000
