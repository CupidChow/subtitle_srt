It's popping! It's popping!

00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,125
Welcome.

7
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,492
This…

8
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,459
Thank you.

9
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,125
Your hands must be cold.

10
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,325
It's okay.

11
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,059
So, have you had a chance to talk about it?

12
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:14,192
She treats me like I'm invisible.

13
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,225
According to Ah Reum, she's already
signed the contract for the goshitel.

14
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:19,692
Are you okay with that?

15
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:23,725
No, I am not okay.

16
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,925
You know, when Kang Hee goes to Seoul,

17
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:33,092
she will meet a lot of Seoul guys.

18
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:37,859
So what?

19
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:42,259
Are you okay with that?

20
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,459
Yeah, well,

21
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,459
given the situation…

22
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,092
When I was young

23
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,259
I used to really annoy her mom.

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,792
"She's my daughter, where would she go?"

25
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,659
Right?

26
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,459
This.

27
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,092
Give this to Kang Hee.

28
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:11,992
What is this?

29
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,359
Just give it to Kang Hee.

30
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,459
Please give it yourself.

31
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,359
How can I give it to someone
who won't even look me in the eye?

32
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,392
It's because I'm shy.

33
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,092
You might be shy, sir,

34
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,059
but I am saying it's scary.

35
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,525
She's your friend.

36
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,459
You're her dad.

37
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,859
Please give it yourself.

38
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:35,925
You've got a call.

39
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,759
You should answer it.

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,259
Answer it and come out.

41
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,392
Yes.

42
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,259
Yes?

43
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,425
Where are you? Everyone is already waiting.

44
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:49,759
Huh? I'll be right there.

45
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,036
I can't stand to watch them
being insolent anymore.

46
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,825
- Come quickly!
- Okay.

47
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,392
- I'll toss what I'm eating.
- Okay.

48
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,759
Shoot! Shoot!

49
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,959
Yeon Soo, happy New Year.

50
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,992
Happy New Year, sir.

51
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,725
Sure.

52
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,792
I also want to receive lots
of blessings in the New Year.

53
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,325
Seems like your friends are waiting.

54
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,059
Go ahead.

55
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,325
Aren't you going to the motel?

56
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,759
I have someone to meet.

57
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,092
Take care.

58
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,992
I said I'm going.

59
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,625
You're coming?

60
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,059
Okay, come on.

61
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,959
I was supposed to meet Han Woo.

62
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,125
So be it.

63
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,625
I'll say my goodbyes now.

64
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,025
Live well, Cheon Yeon Soo.

65
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:52,359
Today, taking the last train to go to Seoul,

66
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,759
I'll welcome the New Year in Jonggak.

67
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,859
And

68
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:59,292
I won't come here ever again.

69
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:03,659
Kang Hee, wait.

70
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,159
I'll be there soon, so wait for me, okay?

[Episode 1]

72
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,459
[Motel California]

73
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:09,992
Kang Hee.

74
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,192
Kang Hee.

75
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:23,259
Ji Kang Hee!

76
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,859
Teddy bear.

77
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,992
It's dazzling, stop it.

78
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,292
Why is it so dark?

79
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,659
- The electricity is cut off.
- A blackout?

80
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,725
I said the electricity is cut off,
because we couldn't pay the bill.

81
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:45,925
How did that happen?

82
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:49,592
Chun Pil must have spent it all on some
gold mine or silver mine in Australia.

83
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,959
Probably, he spent all the money, I guess.

84
00:06:58,592 --> 00:06:59,992
What about the manager?

85
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,492
Mr. Go went to Jeju Island
because he had things to take care of.

86
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,925
He said he'll be back in a few days.

87
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,059
Chun Pil also said he won't be able to come
in today because he's meeting someone.

88
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:10,292
So, you've been alone until now?

89
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:12,892
When have I not been?

90
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,125
Charlie, hello!

91
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,225
Look at this.

92
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:55,059
What is this?

93
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,525
It's a birthday gift from Chun Pil.

94
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,592
A teddy bear.

95
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,159
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

96
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,992
He said this is an original.

97
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:10,692
Someone brought it by plane from Germany
on a business trip, upon request.

98
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:13,059
Still, he put a lot of thought into it.

99
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,525
What's wrong with him?

100
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,159
Maybe it's Chun Pil's money?

101
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,759
The motel is about to be auctioned off.
Why gift an over one million won doll,

102
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,825
when he can't even pay the electricity bill?

103
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:23,292
He is crazy! Crazy.

104
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:25,459
But you still like teddy bears, don't you?

105
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,492
That was when I was a kid.

106
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,425
I'm turning 20 tomorrow.
What am I doing with a doll as a gift?

107
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:32,425
A laptop would be another story.

108
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,559
That's annoying.

109
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,559
The more I see, the angrier I get,
the more it annoys me.

110
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,192
It's super cozy.

111
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:50,759
Teddy bear.

112
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,725
You're alike.

113
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,925
Teddy bear, answer me,
because this is the last time I'm asking.

114
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,659
What?

115
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:14,492
Are you really not going to college in Seoul?

116
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,092
Sorry.

117
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,492
No need to be sorry.

118
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,025
To you, Grandfather
must be more important than me.

119
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:26,492
You brat without any ambition.

120
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:30,192
It's not like that,
but it's true I have no ambition.

121
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:33,459
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:37,892
Come here.

123
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,992
This teddy bear brat.

124
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:48,959
You've gained more weight, haven't you?

125
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
No, what are you talking about?

126
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,525
What do you mean, no?

127
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,525
Let's see.

128
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,159
Look at this fat.

129
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,559
- You weigh over 100kg, don't you?
- Over 100kg, my foot.

130
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:01,325
Ah, it's ticklish, stop it. I said stop it.

131
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:07,225
Yeon Soo,

132
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,792
will you sleep with me?

133
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,592
You must be crazy!

134
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:17,025
Geez, really.

135
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,559
What? Why are you so surprised?

136
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:24,859
You think of me every day, don't you?

137
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,725
Why are you suddenly saying weird things?

138
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:30,459
What's weird? It's natural.

139
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,825
It's you and me.

140
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,692
Stop talking nonsense.

141
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:36,492
You

142
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,759
dream of me every night, don't you?

143
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,025
It's not just thinking, is it?

144
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,059
What are you saying?

145
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,359
I can't hear you.

146
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,792
I know all about the condoms

147
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,425
you have inside your wallet.

148
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:57,092
Hey, that's because you gave them
saying they were motel freebies.

149
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:59,125
The same with Han Woo,
Seung Eon, and me, right?

150
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,659
You gave them to us to share equally…

151
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:06,459
You gave them to us to use.

152
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,859
Have you already used it all up?

153
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,692
I only gave you two, right?

154
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,025
That's not true.

155
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,592
You gave two each to Han Woo,
Seung Eon, and me,

156
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,792
and you don't even know.

157
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,692
So you're saying you still have both

158
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:21,959
inside your wallet?

159
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,925
Let's use them today.

160
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,859
Let me see.

161
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:29,992
Where is it?

162
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:32,525
Where is it? Let me see.

163
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,292
No, it's not there. I'm telling you, it's not.

164
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,525
- Oh? I think I found it.
- No, that's a phone.

165
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,759
Give it here.

166
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:40,592
I told you it's not it.

167
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:43,092
- But it is.
- Why are you like this, really?

168
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:45,759
I'm going to leave.

169
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:53,625
After I leave,

170
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,992
you'll meet another girl,

171
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:02,259
fall in love, and have sex.

172
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,759
Isn't that what you'll do?

173
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,225
I want to be your first.

174
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,259
Why?

175
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,759
Aren't you a first-timer?

176
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,625
It's my first time.

177
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,559
If… if you want to.

178
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:34,459
I don't want to join your rebellion.

179
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,625
It's neither curiosity nor a rebellious spirit.

180
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,792
It's just that

181
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:44,325
the first time is the purest.

182
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,392
You don't like that?

183
00:13:57,992 --> 00:13:59,392
Should we stop?

184
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,559
If we do it,

185
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,192
you won't leave?

186
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,359
I am going to leave.

187
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:29,992
I'll go where they don't know I'm different.

188
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,659
How are you different?

189
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,359
My hair color.

190
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,159
My eye color.

191
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,525
Freckles.

192
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:47,325
To me, you're just beautiful.

193
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,359
Yeon Soo.

194
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,659
Will you sleep with me?

195
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,559
Don't lose weight.

196
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,192
Don't take off your glasses in front of others.

197
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,625
Don't smile with your eyes either.

198
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:02,925
[Motel California]

199
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:11,192
Don't wear your glasses yet.

200
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:33,925
Why are you wearing so many clothes?

201
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,259
I have to minimize my luggage.

202
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,759
Huh?

203
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,659
Ah, right!

204
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,559
This.

205
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:53,392
What is it?

206
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:01,292
Your father asked me to give you this.

207
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,692
Anyway, daughter,

208
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:19,225
make sure to use birth control.

209
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,125
What's wrong?

210
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,392
Hey, I must be a dutiful daughter.

211
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:34,325
Look at this. Chun Pil wrote it like

212
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:37,492
"anyway, daughter,
make sure to use birth control"

213
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:45,859
It's again confirmed that I was a mistake
for him. As if I needed reminding.

214
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,459
Here.

215
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,992
I'll take you to the station.

216
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:10,925
I have a favor to ask.

217
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:23,592
Sell the teddy bear and
take care of Charlie after she gives birth.

218
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:28,659
And if there's money left,
please feed the kittens too.

219
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:34,859
I'm leaving.

220
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,259
The name?

221
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,659
Huh?

222
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:55,125
The kittens.

223
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,925
You should give them names before you go.

224
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,259
Oh, Yeon Soo, what am I supposed to do?

225
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,892
Mr. Park and Mr. Kim both can't make it.

226
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:09,425
The mother cow is bawling as if she's dying.
I feel like I'm dying, too.

227
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:11,959
You said the amniotic fluid broke.
There's no time, so let's go quickly.

228
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,292
Let's hurry. Oh, dear.

229
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,459
Oh no, are you okay? And the calf, too?

230
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:23,492
I'll tie and pull it. Please help me when I do.

231
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:25,792
Well, I have to. Oh, it's okay.

232
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,992
Hang in there a little longer.
It seems like it's almost out.

233
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:42,959
It's out! It's out!

234
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,025
You did well.

235
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,592
Grow up healthy.

236
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,425
Go away, that's enough now.

237
00:23:56,492 --> 00:24:01,159
The weather is getting colder. It would be good
to start dressing the calves in warm clothes

238
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,559
and clean the barn a bit, too.

239
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,425
Well, I might as well do it.

240
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,992
I'll help out for a day.

241
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,092
You will?

242
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:15,159
Then how about this. In return,
I could look for a good match for you?

243
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,525
That's okay. I have someone I'm going to marry.

244
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:18,859
Ah, you're lying again.

245
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,359
No, really.

246
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,559
That's why I go to Seoul every weekend.

247
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,059
A girl from Seoul?

248
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,692
What does she do?

249
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:34,759
Now, there are many matters
to intervene in today's processes.

250
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:38,625
The electrical, steel, mechanical,
metal, carpentry teams.

251
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,625
I hope everyone can compromise a little
and proceed with the work.

252
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:45,125
I see many new faces here today.

253
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,625
Please do not start working on your own
under any circumstances.

254
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,525
You must always ask before you begin your task.

255
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,625
Now, above all,
safety is the most important thing.

256
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,359
Be sure to wear your equipment.

257
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,492
And never run or throw materials during work.

258
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:04,425
Now, for safety, let's chant "safety"
three times and then start the work.

259
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:05,725
One, two, three.

260
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:07,659
Safety, safety, safety!

261
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:10,925
Excuse me!

262
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,125
Who is it?

263
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,859
Oh, I'm supposed to meet the site manager here.

264
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:23,792
Stay right there. You could get hurt
barging in here like that.

265
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:26,125
Yes.

266
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,592
Yes, Manager, where are you?

267
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:31,125
There's someone here to see you.

268
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
Don't worry too much about safety,
that's what I'm saying.

269
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,492
Yes.

270
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,659
Look at that, there.

271
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,525
Hey, Ji Kang Hee,

272
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,425
slipping away?

273
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,859
Why is this still here?
Haven't you moved it to the second floor?

274
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,559
This is why women are a problem.

275
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,925
Who cares if she knows things or has a degree?

276
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,459
Look at this. This!

277
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:15,159
You're as skinny as a stick.

278
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,392
How would you do anything
with this weak arm? Right?

279
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:26,192
Hey, what are you doing?

280
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:27,425
Let go, will you?

281
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:29,025
I'm strong, you know?

282
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:30,459
Ah, go away.

283
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:37,692
Hey! You!

284
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:38,859
Get out!

285
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:42,492
I was going to quit anyway.

286
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,759
I said I would quit
if you messed with me one more time.

287
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,859
Hey! Ji Kang Hee!

288
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,192
Don't you dare show up at my site again.

289
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:57,625
How rude, that disrespectful!

290
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,525
Oh my, that…

291
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,792
Excuse me.

292
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,425
I have something to ask.

293
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,459
It's your first time at the site, right?

294
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,059
Oh, yes.

295
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:31,459
If you wear wide pants like this at the site,

296
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:33,025
you can easily trip and fall.

297
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:35,359
- Oh, I see.
- Put these ankle straps on.

298
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,492
And wear a neck warmer if possible.
It gets pretty dusty.

299
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,892
Have you filled out the contract?

300
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,225
No, not yet.

301
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,925
When you write the contract, you must make sure
to check the daily payment date.

302
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,359
- Yes.
- As for the site,

303
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,225
because the scaffolding is made
of old recycled materials,

304
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:57,892
- be extra careful when moving around.
- Yes.

305
00:27:57,892 --> 00:28:00,692
You don't have to worry about the foreman
nagging to collect scrap metal,

306
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,959
since he's just going to sell it
and pocket the money anyway.

307
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,925
I heard you used to be an interior designer.

308
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:10,859
I heard it from the site manager.

309
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,359
I'll introduce myself properly.

310
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,092
My name is Hwang Jung Goo,
and I'm the new site supervisor.

311
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,792
[Moment's Director Hwang Jung Goo]

312
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,225
How about starting over as a designer?

313
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:32,325
Thanks for the offer, but I'm fine.

314
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:34,725
Why? Because of the blacklist?

315
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:36,559
You said you're six months behind.

316
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,659
Isn't it natural to report unpaid wages
in such a situation?

317
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,625
Know this, blacklisting and whatnot,
it's a wrong practice to give disadvantages.

318
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,059
Instead of working for dirty people like that,
come to Moment and…

319
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,559
Is Moment any different?

320
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,459
Do you think I haven't tried?

321
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:54,592
They say no educational restrictions, but
won't accept a resume from a lower university.

322
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,025
Please don't give me false hope.

323
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:08,059
Then, instead of Moment,
trust me, Hwang Jung Goo, and come.

324
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,859
I'll support and fight for you
if anyone mistreats you this time.

325
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:18,492
When can you prepare your portfolio?

326
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,192
I've come to see the director.

327
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,025
What's your name?

328
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,659
It's Ji Kang Hee.

329
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,525
- Just leave it here.
- Excuse me?

330
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,925
The director is not here right now,
so just leave it.

331
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,425
I'll wait.

332
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,725
Well, then…

333
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,892
Unbelievable! She really came.

334
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,892
You know, the girl I talked about last time.
Director Hwang must be crazy.

335
00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:18,459
She should know better after being sent to a
construction site instead of being appointed CEO.

336
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:21,892
That's what I'm saying.
She doesn't know how long she'll last.

337
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:25,192
How could she bring in a nobody
that was part of the construction crew?

338
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:27,325
Obviously, the design team wouldn't take her.

339
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,025
Even I got demoted for being part of her team.

340
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:33,092
Would you take her? Someone
who was doing manual labor…

341
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,292
Excuse me.

342
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,592
Ah, just a moment.

343
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:39,292
Which school did you graduate from?

344
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:42,259
Want to grab a coffee later?

345
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:43,925
Okay.

346
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:22,125
What? Why are you staring?

347
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,625
I know,

348
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,292
that I'm not cool.

349
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,225
I'm going back.

350
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:39,259
I'm going to go back. I'm Ji Kang Hee!

351
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,992
Kang Hee, shall we have some ice cream?

352
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:04,559
I dislike it.

353
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,225
I heard a Berry Scoop opened in Central City.

354
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,859
There are so many unique flavors.

355
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:12,325
I'll buy it for you, okay?

356
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,659
And this one is a butterfly, you know?
It only goes to pretty flowers.

357
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:20,825
Huh? It's going towards you.

358
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:25,659
Do you want to try it?

359
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,925
Huh? Here it is. We need to get on this one.

360
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,425
Hello. Two tickets, please.

361
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,092
How did you know?

362
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:43,825
What?

363
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:48,392
The police came to the motel. How did you know?

364
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:49,692
I didn't know?

365
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:54,325
Indeed.

366
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:59,259
Affairs one moment,
love triangle fights the next.

367
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,359
Just when you forget,
a wanted fugitive shows up.

368
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,425
Just when you forget, there's an investigation.

369
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,825
Hey, how did you know?

370
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:13,559
How do you always know to suggest
going for ice cream every time I'm like that?

371
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,425
I just know.

372
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:18,192
Because I always look at you.

373
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:25,392
Don't look at me.

374
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,092
Don't look at me, look forward.

375
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:30,625
I said don't look, don't move.

376
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:32,892
Just try to move.

377
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:34,159
I'll kill you.

378
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,292
[Cheon Yeon Soo]

379
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,459
No wonder you got kicked off the design team.

380
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:25,392
Isn't Director Hwang, whom you work with,
legendary in this line of work?

381
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:29,559
If someone like her brings in a nobody from
a construction site, shouldn't you be curious

382
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,659
what her portfolio looks like?
If you call yourself a designer, that is.

383
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,992
Excuse me, what is this all about?

384
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:34,992
Aren't you curious?

385
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:37,492
About what kind of designer
I am, how skilled I am?

386
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:41,459
I'll show you, what kind of person I am,
what kind of designer I am!

387
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:43,359
- That's not it, right now…
- It's not you.

388
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,892
I'll speak directly with Director Hwang.

389
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,259
- Director went out…
- Move.

390
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,592
You've arrived.

391
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:59,225
Sorry, I couldn't hear
anything from the outside.

392
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:02,492
The eye makeup is amazing.
Why does smoky makeup suit you so well?

393
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:03,959
Do you always do it that way?

394
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,859
Sometimes, only when necessary.

395
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:10,925
It's like the combat gear to me.

396
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,625
I really like that attitude.

397
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,259
Then what about weapons?

398
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:18,092
Pardon?

399
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,492
Weapons.

400
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,625
Pardon?

401
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,125
Portfolio.

402
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,292
Ah, yes.

403
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:40,059
Shall we take a look?

404
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,559
Did you do this yourself?

405
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:16,325
- Yes.
- That doesn't make sense.

406
00:36:16,325 --> 00:36:19,259
There'd be more than enough
part-time jobs available

407
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:23,125
if you're this good with CAD and SketchUp.
I'm sure they'd pay better as well.

408
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,725
It was the site of a blueprint I worked on.

409
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:30,025
I wanted to see how a blueprint
is turned into reality.

410
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:32,592
You're a step late.
It's the CEO's recommendation.

411
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:36,059
Graduated from Parsons in New York
and did an internship with Rockwell Group.

412
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:39,292
Totally different from someone who graduated
from some college and worked at a construction site.

413
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,492
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

414
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:52,525
The Grand Village in Hannam-dong.

415
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,959
A 400 square meter villa with a garden.

416
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,892
It needs remodeling. What do you think?

417
00:36:56,892 --> 00:37:00,252
It's a personal request to me,
so there's no bidding, and no budget limits.

418
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,492
So what?

419
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:04,159
I think you should do it, Mr. Mok.

420
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,559
And Ms. Ji Kang Hee could learn a lot too.

421
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,359
And I'd need your approval, right?

422
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,692
No, no.

423
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:12,425
- It's your project, why should I?
- Then I would take credit for it?

424
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,759
Yes, you can take credit.

425
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:17,959
Just take Ms. Ji Kang Hee

426
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,192
as the project designer.

427
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:23,359
Let's start with an internship.

428
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,125
We'll consider formal employment
after working on the project together.

429
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,959
And decide after three months.

430
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,125
Deal.

431
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,425
Um…

432
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:45,625
Do you like me?

433
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:47,292
Pardon?

434
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:50,525
Why go to such lengths,
for someone you just met?

435
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,959
Isn't this the second time? We'll keep
seeing each other going forward.

436
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:56,825
Ms. Kang Hee, you were the first one
to be kind to me when we met.

437
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,092
I did that because I thought
you were someone who came to work.

438
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,992
Thanks to what you told me, I came to know

439
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:04,625
about reinforcing bars being diverted, materials
being fudged, and payments being delayed.

440
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,759
I was able to grasp the situation at once

441
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:09,692
and completely took control of
the manager and his men.

442
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:14,059
So I'm just repaying my debt.

443
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,525
Thank you for the opportunity.

444
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:26,325
Let's make one more thing clear.

445
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:31,659
I really like men.

446
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,425
Ah.

447
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,659
Hey, don't you ever get tired? Coming
to Seoul every time you have a day off?

448
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,125
It's Seoul.

449
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,525
Seoul, what about it?

450
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:36,325
You know best what Seoul means to me.

451
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:40,292
Do you really think we'd run into each other
just because you come here every day?

452
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:44,192
Wake up, Seoul's population
is ten million. Ten million!

453
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,925
Still, the possibility isn't zero.

454
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,092
Just in case, on the off chance

455
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:51,359
you met Ji Kang Hee.

456
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,225
What will you do if you meet her?

457
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,459
If we meet?

458
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,025
Will I be able to recognize her?

459
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,759
Ji Kang Hee.

460
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:15,559
Today is the client meeting day.

461
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,159
As I mentioned yesterday,
please make sure you select well…

462
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,692
I would like you to prepare about five drafts.

463
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,225
- Yes.
- Yes, I understand.

464
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:25,625
- So Min.
- Yes?

465
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:28,325
How much should we estimate for each draft?

466
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:32,859
We are budgeting about 8,000
to 9,000 for each draft…

467
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,825
8,000 to 9,000…

468
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:37,792
Ms. Ji Kang Hee,

469
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:42,492
an intern's job is to keep their seat
and answer the phone well… Go on.

470
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:44,159
How long have you been sitting there?

471
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,692
- Indeed…
- Um…

472
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:48,325
Please increase the price
per square meter a bit more.

473
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:49,625
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

474
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,492
Why'd you get intern business cards?

475
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,959
Of course, you need a business card
when meeting a client.

476
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,425
You want me to take the intern?

477
00:40:57,425 --> 00:40:59,492
Of course, it's her responsibility.

478
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:01,759
I've already said so to the client.

479
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,092
Have a good meeting and come back.

480
00:41:13,692 --> 00:41:15,559
Our intern is quite capable, isn't she?

481
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:17,525
That's right.

482
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,759
Thank you as always, Han Woo.

483
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:25,092
What are you thanking me for again?

484
00:41:25,092 --> 00:41:27,192
Are there no difficult customers these days?

485
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,725
Oh, why wouldn't there be? Don't even
mention it… There was a big fuss yesterday.

486
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,159
Oh, dear.

487
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,759
I can't handle it anymore, either.

488
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,359
Would you like something to drink? It's on me.

489
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,425
Really?

490
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:45,092
So, what, shall we get
a coffee transfusion or something?

491
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:47,792
I was just feeling like I needed that.

492
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:48,925
Sounds good.

493
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,992
No, no, it has to be the most expensive one…

494
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:56,159
No need for alternatives, second-best,
cost-effectiveness or anything of the sort.

495
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,825
Just give me the best of whatever.

496
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:03,159
Understood, I'll do my best.

497
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:07,159
Pack up, it's time to go.

498
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,592
Already leaving? Without even a proper meeting?

499
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,225
We just had the meeting.

500
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:20,859
We need to meet the newlyweds who will
actually live here, not just the one paying,

501
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:22,859
and learn what kind of house they want.

502
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,892
- What kind of interior do they want…
- It's our job to suggest that.

503
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:27,525
Start by preparing the concept board.

504
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:30,992
It's not about fitting people to a house,
but fitting a house to the people.

505
00:42:32,492 --> 00:42:34,892
I'm sorry, she is still an intern…

506
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,759
Ms. Ji Kang Hee?

507
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:40,759
Yes.

508
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,625
That's a good point, isn't it?

509
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,959
I was shortsighted in my desire for a surprise.

510
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:47,959
One moment, please.

511
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:52,559
Ji Kang Hee.

512
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:54,625
Let's talk later.

513
00:42:56,025 --> 00:42:57,725
They say they can come in two hours.

514
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:03,359
What should I do? I have
an important meeting today.

515
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:06,925
Unbelievable.

516
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,659
Are you saying I should tell them
not to come then?

517
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,325
I'm available.

518
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:17,792
I'll take today's meeting and
will share the minutes with you.

519
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,425
Just today! I want this
to be your priority from now on.

520
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:25,859
Thank you for your understanding.

521
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:30,125
- Then, please take care of it.
- Yes.

522
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,125
I will take my leave first.

523
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:39,025
Please go ahead.

524
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,892
I'll take measurements while waiting.

525
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:56,059
Did we possibly…

526
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:57,159
Did you sleep with me?

527
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:01,292
Wow, that's bold.

528
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:04,092
I was expecting something like,
"are you interested in me?"

529
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:08,592
Would you like some coffee?

530
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,792
Sounds good.

531
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,425
I'm going to buy mine. What would you like?

532
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,059
Customer number 32,
here is your ordered beverage.

533
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:38,792
Thank you.

534
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,425
Enjoy your drink.

535
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:42,092
Moment offers the coffee.

536
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:43,392
Thank you.

537
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,225
Why are you like this?

538
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:02,059
- Kang Hee…
- Yes?

539
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,425
- Ji Kang Hee.
- Ji Kang Hee?

540
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:08,792
- You saw her?
- Yeah.

541
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:09,825
Hey, where?

542
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:10,859
Where? Where?

543
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:14,659
Where? Hey, you need to find her quickly!

544
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:16,292
Hey, am I going alone?

545
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:17,725
Come out!

546
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:42,392
Are you sure you saw her?

547
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:50,959
It was my grandfather.

548
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:52,692
No, I'm telling you it was my mother.

549
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:54,092
That's not true.

550
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:58,092
Our parents agreed to wait
until we graduated from college,

551
00:45:58,092 --> 00:45:59,859
but Grandfather rushed our marriage.

552
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:02,925
So, what's important about that now?

553
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:05,892
It's a fact that you ran away
because you didn't like me.

554
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:09,092
And I became the one lucky man.

555
00:46:09,092 --> 00:46:10,225
Thank you, Seok Kyeong.

556
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,425
Yes, thank you, Geum Seok Kyeong.

557
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,492
Look at you, baby! You're so gorgeous.

558
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:18,025
Don't do it.

559
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,492
- No, I can't stop it.
- Don't do it, I said don't.

560
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,992
Hey, stop it!

561
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:26,059
I'm sorry.

562
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,692
Shall we start the consultation?

563
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:34,792
The problem is my tastes are too diverse.

564
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:40,525
I like a wide range of things,
what should I explain about…

565
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:44,825
Just keywords or a mood that comes to mind?

566
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,659
Feel free to talk comfortably.

567
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:48,559
Keywords…

568
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:51,425
Fun.

569
00:46:51,425 --> 00:46:52,692
Fun…

570
00:46:52,692 --> 00:46:55,892
I'd like our home to be cheerful and fun.

571
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:59,325
I grew up in a strict and rigid environment.

572
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:03,592
What do you think would be fun
to do in this space?

573
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,825
To be honest, when I was young,

574
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,259
I wanted to have my own comic room

575
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,392
to read comic books without looking around

576
00:47:13,392 --> 00:47:15,592
and to invite friends over to play games.

577
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,592
Like a rebel's hideout…

578
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:21,659
Imagine if this room was a duplex.

579
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,159
A duplex?

580
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,025
Can this place be turned into a duplex?

581
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:29,259
If we open up the slab of this room
and raise the ceiling height, it's possible.

582
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:31,859
You make it a duplex and separate the spaces.

583
00:47:32,525 --> 00:47:35,959
On the upper level,
you could put a few bean bags

584
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:41,125
and create a space entirely for yourself
where you can read comics or books.

585
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,625
And on the lower level,
you could play games with friends

586
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:48,292
and separate the areas
so you could drink wine or coffee.

587
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:49,825
So…

588
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,425
Good, isn't it?

589
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:55,225
There's a term called "man cave".

590
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:58,759
Originally, it was a space
for men's hobbies and such.

591
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:01,825
But this space wouldn't be a "man cave"

592
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,625
it would be an "Esther cave".

593
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,792
Esther cave…

594
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,725
Wow, was interior consulting always this fun?

595
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,359
Geum Seok Kyeong.

596
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,125
- Yes?
- Your gift is really cool.

597
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,992
I really like it.

598
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,325
Even than mine, babe?

599
00:48:22,325 --> 00:48:24,925
Isn't our Victor so cute?

600
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:26,925
Right?

601
00:48:26,925 --> 00:48:27,992
Yes.

602
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:40,425
[Utilizing natural light
that flows in naturally]

603
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:48,525
[Like a hidden hideout]

604
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,525
[Hobby room]

605
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,792
Let's call it a day.

606
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,559
Why is she pulling an all-nighter
when even we aren't?

607
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:03,059
For just a three-month intern,

608
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:05,092
do you think Mr. Mok
would even give that a glance?

609
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:07,092
He definitely wouldn't. Never.

610
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:49,325
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

611
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:50,359
Yes?

612
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:53,392
I get that you're creative and diligent,

613
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:56,592
but this design doesn't
quite fit with our company.

614
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:03,359
Is it me that doesn't fit, or is it my design?

615
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:07,059
I'll be honest with you.

616
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:08,892
I am a person with prejudices.

617
00:50:09,992 --> 00:50:13,925
I think the better the educational background,
family, specs, appearance, the better.

618
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:16,525
But I have no prejudices regarding ability.

619
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:20,959
Can someone with prejudices
really evaluate ability without bias?

620
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:24,425
Isn't true ability about
overcoming such prejudices?

621
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:27,125
- The client might like my proposal.
- This crap?

622
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,725
I've reflected what the client wants
as much as possible

623
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:31,525
and I've analyzed their lifestyle thoroughly.

624
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:32,625
Ms. Ji Kang Hee,

625
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:35,059
what do you know about the client?

626
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:39,759
A friend gifts a 400 square meter
newlywed house as a wedding gift,

627
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:41,625
regardless of the cost.

628
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,325
It's another class.

629
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:46,359
Someone at the bottom of life,
living in a goshiwon and doing manual labor,

630
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:48,859
couldn't possibly approach that world.

631
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:52,425
Let's not wear each other out
and just stop here.

632
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,759
- Mr. Kim Daniel.
- Yes.

633
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,759
About that modern design earlier…

634
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,192
Am I being fired right now?

635
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:58,659
I acknowledge Ms. Kang Hee's CAD skills.

636
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:00,725
I'll contact you if there's any part-time work.

637
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,959
Bring the proposal here.

638
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:03,992
Yes.

639
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,059
Okay.

640
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:13,459
- I think this is quite good.
- Oh, yes.

641
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:15,392
It seems to have turned out
really well in a woodsy style.

642
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:23,559
- It's good.
- Yes?

643
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:28,092
It's unique and cozy
yet chic on the other hand.

644
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:29,325
Chic?

645
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:31,859
The color combination is no joke.

646
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,825
If the furniture is refurbished in this style,
it would look like a Mandini piece.

647
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,225
You met Ji Kang Hee, right?

648
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:40,059
Did you rush off to tattle that she was fired?

649
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,259
Fired? The designer in charge
during the project?

650
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:54,159
Oh, what to do about being upset?

651
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:55,325
Nonsense!

652
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,659
If there's a company looking
for a designer, I'll reach out to you.

653
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:00,292
That's enough, don't badmouth
behind others' backs.

654
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:01,592
You'll come to visit sometimes, right?

655
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:03,292
Would you come if you were me?

656
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,392
Come on, we should
have a farewell party, right?

657
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,425
Will you do it?

658
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:11,225
Then, please do it.

659
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:14,292
Alright, let's set a date.

660
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:15,959
Thank you for everything till now.

661
00:52:15,959 --> 00:52:17,859
I'll go and greet the manager before I leave.

662
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:21,259
It's not like we're going
with Kang Hee's as the main one.

663
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:25,059
I'm just asking to include it in the presentation
with the other proposals, how is that overstepping?

664
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,092
Do you think you're still the head
of the design department?

665
00:52:28,092 --> 00:52:31,425
You were pushed out
because your skills fell behind, right?

666
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:32,592
Mr. Mok.

667
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:36,025
Are you telling me to use
this kind of poor design?

668
00:52:36,025 --> 00:52:38,292
Something like a cheap countryside motel room?

669
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:40,625
Take a closer look.

670
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,959
This design is grade B.

671
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:48,092
Ji Kang Hee, whom you brought in,
is inescapably a B-grade hick.

672
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:57,025
If I'm grade B, then you're an F level.

673
00:52:57,692 --> 00:52:59,708
Obsolete, just patching together
other people's designs.

674
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:00,859
What?

675
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:04,192
Copying and pasting anything
that looks good from all sorts of archives.

676
00:53:04,192 --> 00:53:06,525
Even the abuse of authority by taking over
thumbnails from team members.

677
00:53:06,525 --> 00:53:08,092
- No, that's malicious.
- You…

678
00:53:08,092 --> 00:53:09,092
Are you done talking?

679
00:53:09,092 --> 00:53:11,325
While you're at it, take my stuff too.

680
00:53:12,425 --> 00:53:13,592
Enough!

681
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:15,392
Take it and get out.

682
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,225
- You're fired!
- No!

683
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:19,859
It's you who should be fired.

684
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:22,192
Completely out of my life!

685
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:29,592
Out!

686
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:40,759
[Moment]

687
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,592
I'm sorry for the opportunity you gave me.

688
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:46,192
It's not Kang Hee's fault, I'll somehow…

689
00:53:46,192 --> 00:53:47,659
No.

690
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:51,092
It's more comfortable and honorable
to sweat at a construction site.

691
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:54,525
I will stop here.

692
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:55,159
I didn't come to Seoul to live like this.

693
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:06,259
I didn't abandon you to live such a lousy life.

694
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:18,125
They say family members
can't marry, did you know?

695
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,225
Why marry if we're already family?

696
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:24,659
I don't like it, I'm going to marry.

697
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:28,525
Marry me, Kang Hee.

698
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:30,659
What are you saying?

699
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,459
Huh? It's snowing.

700
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:44,525
Hey, Cheon Yeon Soo, did you know?

701
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,225
If you eat the first snow ten times,

702
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:50,225
you'll be with your first love.

703
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:51,492
Really?

704
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:54,692
One.

705
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:57,525
Two.

706
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,225
Ten times.

707
00:57:11,225 --> 00:57:12,759
