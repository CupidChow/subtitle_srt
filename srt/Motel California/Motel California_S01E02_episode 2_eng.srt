1
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:29,090


2
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,633
    
 In Motel California, there are

3
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,633
lots of things made of wood. Right?

4
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:40,700
You know cockroaches are what I fear the most in this world.

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,867
I was looking straight ahead.

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,733
And a cockroach with antennae

7
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,767
like this came towards me.

8
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:53,933
It suddenly stuck to my face…

9
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,780
It just…

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,833
I don't remember what happened next.

11
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,400
Hangover…

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,100
By the way, it's time for your mom to come.

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,567
Yes.

14
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:17,267
Oh, right. You might not be waiting for your mom.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,100
Yeon Soo.

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,533
Yes.

17
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,433
You surprised me, mister.

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,267
Cockroaches are scary.

19
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:46,910
   

20
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,200
 Two, three, four. 

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,567
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

22
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,333
♪ Happy birthday ♪

23
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,460
♪ Dear Ji Kang Hee ♪

24
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:13,833
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

25
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,267
 I'm sick of this. 

26
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,933
 Kang Hee. 

27
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,433
 Kang Hee, let's go together. 

28
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:44,467
 Kang Hee, I said let's go together. 

29
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,533
 Where to? Where do you think I am going? 

30
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,833
 Anywhere. 

31
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,833
 Kang Hee, wherever you go, I will be with you for life. 

32
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,533
 Why would you? 

33
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:08,200
 Because I like you. 

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,000
Excuse me.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,067
Excuse me, please let go of me.

36
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,433
Kang Hee.

37
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,667
Grandfather has…

38
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,400
Grandfather has passed away, Kang Hee.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,633
Cheon Yeon Soo?

40
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,733
 What are they doing? 

41
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,667
 How could they do that unless they're out of their minds? 

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,100
Move aside.

43
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,600
I have to say goodbye to Grandfather.

44
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Oh, right.

45
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,267
Kang Hee, you are here.

46
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,667
I missed you, Kang Hee.

47
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,833
You are lying.

48
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,767
It's not a lie.

49
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,500
Then, why did you do that to me back then?

50
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,367
I liked you so much.

51
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,033
Do you think everything will be fine just by smiling like that?

52
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:43,567
Since it's in the past, I'll just let it go.

53
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:46,400
By the way, what on earth did you do to Yeon Soo?

54
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,267
How much must you have made Yeon Soo suffer for him to change like that?

55
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,600
Father! Father!

56
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,733
Yeon Soo! Father!

57
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,333
- Mom. 
 - Oh, dear.

58
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,467
Mom, are you okay?

59
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,900
It's okay, it's okay.

60
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,200
Your mom always liked falling over like this.

61
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,933
Jeez, Soon Ja.

62
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,333
- Mom. 
 - Get up, get up.

63
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,367
Oh, how embarrassing.

64
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,733
This won't do… carry her to the room, quickly…

65
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,333
- Yes. 
 - Mom.

66
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,367
Daughter, you came?

67
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,533
If someone saw you, they'd think you were her husband.

68
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,967
Oh, what?

69
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,500
- Hyungnim! 
 - Oh, yes.

70
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,867
You must've been shocked, right? Thanks for making the hard trip here.

71
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,100
It wasn't hard.

72
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,800
That's not it, it's just that our honeymoon was ruined…

73
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,267
You can go on your honeymoon again.

74
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,300
That's true. It's not like my father-in-law is going to pass away twice.

75
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,700
Huh?

76
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,800
- Go change your clothes. 
 - Yes.

77
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,400
Wow, is she just leaving like that?

78
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
Without even acknowledging anyone?

79
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:56,567
- I'll bring her here. 
 - No, I don't want to force her to greet us.

80
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,567
- Where is Kang Hee? 
 - She left.

81
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,533
Without even acknowledging anyone.

82
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,533
Oh my.

83
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,467
I don't want to see her anymore.

84
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,850
 She looked mixed when she was younger, 

85
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,460
 but it's harder to tell now she's older. 

86
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:27,367
 She really looks more and more like her mom as she grows up. 

87
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:30,100
 At times like this, it's fortunate that Soon Ja isn't here. Right? 

88
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,467
 - It's not Soon Ja, but it's Soo Ji… 
 - Soo Ji! 

89
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:36,167
 Honestly, Soon Ja may be a bit odd, but what did they do wrong? 

90
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,667
 Come to think of it, Chun Pil has been acting up a bit. 

91
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,600
 That's why either Soon Ja or Chun Pil, one of them should have left the neighborhood. 

92
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,667
 Quiet, they might hear us… What if she goes crazy again? 

93
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,833
 Right, hasn't she caused trouble inthe neighborhood once or twice before? 

94
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,433
Kang Hee.

95
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,933
Kang Hee.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,967
Have something to eat before you go.

97
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:12,567
- Are you telling me to go back in there? 
 - Huh?

98
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,500
Everyone's just staring at me.

99
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,100
I feel like I've become a monkey at the zoo.

100
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,400
Isn't it better than no one recognizing you at all?

101
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,467
What?

102
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,500
I was very flustered that you didn't recognize me.

103
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,533
You came without expecting even that much?

104
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,100
You came here, fully aware of everything, just to see your grandfather, didn't you?

105
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,167
It's the meal offered by Grandpa.

106
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,233
Come in and make sure to eat before you leave.

107
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,833
Jeez.

108
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,533
What's wrong with you?

109
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,767
Han Woo, I talked back to Kang Hee.

110
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,233
What did you say back to her?

111
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,200
I told her to eat before leaving.

112
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,833
You told her to eat before leaving?

113
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,867
Do you think that's talking back?

114
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:16,433
I chased after her to say thank you, but what did I do?

115
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,767
Should I not have told her to come in?

116
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,380
She's not coming in. Don't worry.

117
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,260
Did you forget what her personality is like?

118
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:25,033
She shouldn't…

119
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:29,700
Is he really Cheon Yeon Soo?

120
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,167
Ah Reum.

121
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,367
What about Ah Reum?

122
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,190
See her before you go.

123
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,267
Ah Reum has been waiting for you a lot.

124
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,567
She will be upset if you don't see her before going.

125
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,867
This is my number, save it.

126
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,533
- Who are you? 
 - Why are you acting like that?

127
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,867
I came, didn't I?

128
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,200
I can sit here, right?

129
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,233
Do as you please.

130
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,133
Should I bring you some spicy beef soup?

131
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,300
First, let's have a drink of soju.

132
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,900
I don't know about the others, but they have to come.

133
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
Why? Is there something wrong with them?

134
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,100
They're all like that. Gangsters.

135
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,567
They're all Kang Hee's gang or family.

136
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,767
Cha Seung Eon, Ryu Han Woo, and Cheon Yeon Soo.

137
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,400
And even Han Ah Reum.

138
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,600
Did you see Yeon Soo whining like a loser as soon as Ji Kang Hee arrived?

139
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,333
He was totally whining.

140
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,633
I think they're going to the motel today.

141
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,233
- No way. 
 - Hey!

142
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,933
Of course, they should go to the motel.

143
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,400
They're a motel family, so they should go.

144
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Then, are they motel gangsters?

145
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,167
Motel gangsters? What is that?

146
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,467
Doesn't it smell like a motel around here?

147
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:07,667
 Cha Seung Eon, your mom left you at a motel. Right? 

148
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,867
 You orphaned kid. 

149
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,333
 You don't even know your age, do you? 

150
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,433
 - Are you sure he's a guy? 
 - What should we do about Seung Eon? 

151
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,900
 Should we wake Kang Hee? 

152
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,500
 I think we should. 

153
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,433
 - Kang Hee, wake up. 
 - Kang Hee, wake up. 

154
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:22,267
 Kang Hee, wake up. 

155
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,667
 Hey, try taking off his pants. 

156
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,067
 Oh, shall we? 

157
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:29,733
 - Take them off. 
 - Take them off quickly. 

158
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,633
 Hey, take them off quickly. 

159
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:34,400
 He took off his pants. 

160
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,367
 Hey! 

161
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,400
 Take them off quickly. 

162
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
 Hey! 

163
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,267
 Hey! 

164
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,600
 Seung Eon, are you okay? Let's go. 

165
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,167
 Are you okay? 

166
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,267
 Don't cry, don't cry. 

167
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,500
 Can you walk? 

168
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,867
 Hey, Ji Kang Hee. 

169
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,467
 You're living in a motel without a home, aren't you? 

170
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,000
 What's the matter with living in a motel? 

171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,800
 Oh, right. Han Woo, you live in a barn, don't you? 

172
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,067
 Ugh, you smell like cow dung. 

173
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,067
 How about we call him "cow dung" from now on? 

174
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,567
 - Yeah, that's a good idea. 
 - Good. 

175
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,700
 Don't tease each other. 

176
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,733
 Get lost, Cheon Yeon Soo, you pig. 

177
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,433
 Hey, Kim Heon Yeol. 

178
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,500
 If you keep doing that, you'll get struck by lightning. 

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
 Lightning? 

180
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,467
 I guess you have that ability because you're a mutt? 

181
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,900
 - Mutt? What's that? 
 - Mutt? What's that? 

182
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,233
 Mutt! 

183
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,600
 Her mother is a mutt, so she is also… 

184
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,400
 - I'm not a mutt, okay?  
  - "I'm not a mutt, okay?" 

185
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,900
 She's a mutt. She's a mutt. 

186
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,967
 She's a mutt. She's a mutt. 

187
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:56,200
 She's a mutt. She's a mutt. 

188
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,867
 She's a mutt. She's a mutt. 

189
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:02,233
 She's a mutt. 

190
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:27,100
Ah Reum, I thought I'd forgotten everything.

191
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,900
Forgotten what?

192
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey.

193
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,200
Oh my, you startled me.

194
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,867
Can I join you here?

195
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,433
Oh yeah, Kang Hee.

196
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,967
- Hello. 
 - It's been a while.

197
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,667
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course.

198
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,933
Who is this person?

199
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,133
What are you talking about?

200
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,800
He's not our schoolmate, right?

201
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,700
Don't you remember Kim Heon Yeol?

202
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,067
Oh, Kim Heon Yeol.

203
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,233
The one who got struck by lightning, right?

204
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,567
Right?

205
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,367
You remember me.

206
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:10,733
Come over to practice golf sometime.

207
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,300
Do you play golf?

208
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,567
No, I've been a bit busy with work.

209
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,033
What do you do for a living?

210
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,800
I just work at a company.

211
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,900
I'll give you one of my business cards, too.

212
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,433
Me too, thanks.

213
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,667
It's all in English.

214
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,500
Kang Hee, you made it big. Is it a foreign company?

215
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,167
The company has some shares in the UK.

216
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,400
I haven't heard of that company.

217
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
It's the top in the interior industry.

218
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,533
Any famous hotel or shopping mall these days has been renovated by our company.

219
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,600
Then you must be getting a good salary.

220
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,533
Why are you curious about someone else's salary?

221
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,433
That's so old-fashioned.

222
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,267
Old-fashioned?

223
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,467
What's wrong with you again?

224
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:06,233
I don't know, I'm too anxious to listen to what she's saying.

225
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,100
Ji Kang Hee?

226
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,833
People living in Seoul? They may say they live in Seoul.

227
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:16,667
But they're probably in some small house on the outskirts, eating instant noodles.

228
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:20,067
It's funny how they try to act fancy and wear luxury brands.

229
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:24,533
Isn't it better than acting all cocky just because your parents have money?

230
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,767
What? What did you say?

231
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,200
You heard what I said. Don't act like you didn't.

232
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,633
Whether I eat instant noodles in a room on the outskirts or carry luxury items,

233
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:36,067
I'm taking responsibility for my own life.

234
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,367
I haven't seen any of those girls who moved away turn out well.

235
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,533
They live together with any old man,

236
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,370
recklessly get pregnant, live miserably,

237
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,460
and then eventually find some fool to marry them.

238
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,833
Hey!

239
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:52,600
- You're not in a position to talk. You were suspended from school for getting a bar girl pregnant. 
- Stop it.

240
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,733
- Your level of decency hasn't changed… 
 - What are you doing?

241
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,367
- Hey, hey! 
 - Kang Hee, are you okay?

242
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,500
Stop it, Heon Yeol.

243
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
- Did I do something wrong? Huh? 
 - No, it's not that.

244
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,033
Calm down.

245
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,167
Why? What?

246
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,533
Calm down.

247
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,867
What are you doing?

248
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,133
It was nice to see you.

249
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,567
Kang Hee, you…

250
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,100
- Kim Heon Yeol, calm down. 
 - Hey, move aside.

251
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,100
- Hey, hey! 
 - Ji Kang Hee!

252
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,767
Are you okay, Kang Hee?

253
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,500
Move aside, you rat.

254
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,167
Why does the chief mourner just keep hugging this girl?

255
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,767
What's so great about a mutt like her?

256
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,167
Hey, Yeon Soo.

257
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,733
Yeon Soo, what's wrong? It's not like you.

258
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:09,033
Thanks for coming, Kang Hee.

259
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,567
Be careful on your way back.

260
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,233
Seung Eon, please take Kang Hee outside.

261
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,733
Let's go.

262
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,633
Are you crazy? What are you trying to do?

263
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,467
Hey.

264
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,133
Mister, let me go first…

265
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,433
Why, why?

266
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,067
Huh?

267
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,767
Ahjussi cleaned up your room for you.

268
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,367
Let's go.

269
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,233
The neighborhood's been nice and quiet without her.

270
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:24,667
Why would she cause a scene at someone else's funeral?

271
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,367
She came to pay her respects after hearing the news.

272
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,767
She made time for this and came with good intentions.

273
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:34,267
If she's showing up for the first time in 10 years, she should at least greet the elders first.

274
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,933
Why is she starting a fight?

275
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,667
I'm the one who fought, Mom.

276
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,967
Ji Kang Hee started it, right?

277
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:46,733
Why do you keep saying that? What has Kang Hee done wrong?

278
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:53,467
Thinking of my brother, I shouldn't be like this.

279
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,833
But she is really…

280
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,033
If you don't want to see your mom die,

281
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,733
never get involved with her.

282
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,300
I shouldn't have come.

283
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:15,267
I'm happy to see you.

284
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,600
Thank you, Cha Seung Eon.

285
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,133
Thank you for living with Chun Pil.

286
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,867
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

287
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,900
Hey. You couldn't eat properly earlier, right?

288
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,333
I'll prepare it for you.

289
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,590
   

290
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:23,133
   

291
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,700
 If I keep enduring here, 

292
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,500
 like that motel, my life will also get dark. 

293
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,633
 Even if I'm here? 

294
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,667
 You're doing just fine. 

295
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:07,267
 But I can't endure it. 

296
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:16,600
 I'll never come back here again. 

297
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,167
 Is it heavy? 

298
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,833
 Shall I take it? 

299
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,120
   

300
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,333
You shouldn't have done that at a funeral.

301
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,767
Kim Heon Yeol, that guy, couldn't even breathe and was gasping.

302
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,533
It was so scary, like something might happen.

303
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:36,200
I didn't know I was that strong either.

304
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,833
Since it was my first time using my fists.

305
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,400
Kim Heon Yeol might sue you.

306
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,033
It doesn't matter.

307
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:47,533
I've always wanted to hit him at least once in my life.

308
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:52,090
I feel the same way.

309
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,860
Honestly, it felt refreshing.

310
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,133
Kim Heon Yeol used to trouble us a lot, right?

311
00:23:56,133 --> 00:24:00,633
When we were kids, it was always Kang Hee who fought for us, right?

312
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,700
Right.

313
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,000
Seung Eon, where's Kang Hee?

314
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,467
She left.

315
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:14,333
She said she didn't think it would be of any help anyway and left.

316
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,400
What's going on?

317
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,200
I think it's because of that Kim Heon Yeol thing earlier.

318
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,833
   

319
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,933
   

320
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,592
- Hello. 
  - Ms. Ji Kang Hee. 

321
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,167
 This is Geum Seok Kyeong. 

322
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,233
Wow, this design draft…

323
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:18,133
 I resigned, so I'm no longer the person in charge. Sorry. 

324
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,567
What? Did she hang up?

325
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,800
What? Why is he calling me?

326
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,633
 I don't want to have regrets. 

327
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:36,300
 If you're curious, you come. 

328
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,800
 It's still good no matter how much I look at it. 

329
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,067
 Yes. 

330
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,500
 This is Geum Seok Kyeong. 

331
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,300
 You'll come to present, right? 

332
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,900
 How about coming early and having a chat together? 

333
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,933
 Are you teasing me now? 

334
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,600
 What did you say? 

335
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,167
 How can I go there? 

336
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,133
 Didn't you hear from Esther? 

337
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,167
 You really can't come? 

338
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,767
 Then come now, with the draft. 

339
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:29,633
 No, if you're curious, you come. 

340
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,167
 Hello? Hello? 

341
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,900
Right, I definitely hung up.

342
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,800
 All you've got is money. 

343
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,900
 - Is this it? 
 - Can you even understand what you're seeing? 

344
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,800
 "All you've got is money." 

345
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,233
 I was about to say that. 

346
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,967
 Have you arrived, client? 

347
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:16,400
 "You're the first woman to treat me this way." 

348
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:19,433
 I was about to say that. 

349
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:22,000
 The client has arrived here. 

350
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:26,033
 Why did you drink so much? 

351
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,964
 - Because I don't want to have regrets. 
 - Regrets? 

352
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:34,433
 A design that won't be nitpicked by Mr. Mok. 

353
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:37,367
 I know how to do that, too. 

354
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,867
 But that's… 

355
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:44,833
 That's an obvious design that could be done at any house. 

356
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:49,767
 It lacks sincerity and uniqueness. 

357
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,933
 Still, 

358
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,800
 I don't want to regret thinking... 

359
00:28:57,367 --> 00:29:00,100
 "I should've done that." 

360
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:04,033
 Is that why you're drinking alone like this now? 

361
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,433
It has to be a dream.

362
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,600
It has to be a dream.

363
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,767
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

364
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:48,067
I saw your design, Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

365
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:50,400
It felt like I was splashed with ice water.

366
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,767
It really woke me up.

367
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,100
Next time, let's meet as designers, not as a secretary.

368
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,100
Yes.

369
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,000
Come over here.

370
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:28,900
Why are you fierce today?

371
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,233
You said I have to meet Mr. Mok.

372
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:35,533
Today, it's not a battle, so you can just enjoy it.

373
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,933
It's the leisure of a winner.

374
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:43,233
It's a congratulatory gift.

375
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:49,667
What? You did something like that and didn't even realize it yourself?

376
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,633
Pardon?

377
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,333
 Now, nothing has been left out, right? 

378
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,900
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

379
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,600
 And all the sample boards have been loaded into the car? 

380
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,267
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

381
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:00,500
 But why are we having the meeting at the Elitree Hotel? 

382
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,767
 The CEO said that 

383
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:05,667
 our client is the grandson of the Elitree Hotel's founder. 

384
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,667
 - The next one, please. 
 - Yes. 

385
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,733
 Next, please. 

386
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,800
 Yes. 

387
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:26,867
 Thank you for the perfect preparation, Director. 

388
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:29,567
 Yes, you can look forward to it. 

389
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:33,000
 She really likes it. 

390
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,600
 It seems you can proceed just like this. 

391
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,933
 I'll confirm the materials myself along the way. 

392
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:42,900
 - What kind of… 
 - I've received the draft from Ms. Ji Kang Hee. 

393
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,300
 She reflected everything I said without missing a single thing. 

394
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,600
 I was completely moved. 

395
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,333
 Why didn't you come with her? 

396
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,200
 Well… She kept staying up all night… 

397
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,100
 You know about the village we're building in Cheongdam-dong, right? 

398
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,000
 Yeah, the club-style village. 

399
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,333
 It's said that all the residents are either top stars or young and rich. 

400
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,667
 I'd like to commission the interior design there. Is it possible? 

401
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,267
 Like this time, customizing it to fit the client's needs. 

402
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,533
 Of course, that's possible. 

403
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:14,600
 Thank you. 

404
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,248
 I would like Ms. Ji Kang Hee to take charge of the residents' meeting. 

405
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:24,167
 Please make sure to come with her to the next meeting. 

406
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,800
 Director, please help me. 

407
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,600
 You can contact Ji Kang Hee, right? 

408
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,700
 We need to hire her right away. 

409
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,340
 Please, 

410
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,500
  just contact her once. 

411
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,800
 Please, I beg you. 

412
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
Project team leader?

413
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,500
I've reviewed your resume and portfolio again.

414
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,730
Without prejudice or preconception.

415
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,600
You are fully qualified,

416
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
our Ms. Ji.

417
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,900
I wanted to share the happy news quickly, but why couldn't I reach you?

418
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,600
I went to a funeral.

419
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,333
Let's do well from now on.

420
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:12,533
There's something I thought of at the funeral.

421
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,000
You never know when a person will die.

422
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,500
What's the greatest luxury I could indulge in while I'm alive?

423
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,300
Luxury?

424
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,367
Not working with people I dislike.

425
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,500
That's my luxury.

426
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,800
So, you are going to refuse?

427
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,700
This incredible offer?

428
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,300
We fired each other here, didn't we?

429
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,200
 - You're fired! 
 - No! 

430
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
 It's you, the manager, who is fired. 

431
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,900
 You are completely out of my life! 

432
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,033
 Out! 

433
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,000
No.

434
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
Sell it.

435
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,300
Sell me that draft, at least.

436
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,900
I know someone who will pay more for it.

437
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,700
Someone who would buy my design at such an unbelievably high price

438
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,067
that someone like you, Manager, could never dream of affording it.

439
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:12,467
Ms. Ji Kang Hee! Ms. Ji Kang Hee!

440
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Is the money insufficient?

441
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,500
I told you to put in plenty of money. How much is it?

442
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,033
Oh my.

443
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,200
How much should I offer to make it possible, Ms. Ji Kang Hee?

444
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I've already received it.

445
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,300
More than enough.

446
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,067
My self-esteem as a designer.

447
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,333
You paid me more than anyone else in the world.

448
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:07,533
Thank you, both of you.

449
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,567
Ms. Ji Kang Hee.

450
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:24,133
Let's be friends.

451
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,200
It's not an envelope of money, but a wedding invitation.

452
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,067
You must come because you're my friend.

453
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,600
I'll definitely come.

454
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,167
Because we're friends.

455
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,967
Why does that look like an envelope of money?

456
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,800
Yeah, pride is more important than money.

457
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:25,833
   

458
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:33,367
Kang Hee, the water pipe burst, so the boiler isn't working.

459
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,800
But I need to shower.

460
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,700
Oh my, there's no hot water, and the heating isn't working either.

461
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,300
You can't even use the bathroom for a while.

462
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,433
Maybe use wet wipes or something.

463
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:12,267
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah, where are you?

464
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:15,600
Where else? The office, of course.

465
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,100
 Can you talk for a moment? 

466
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,600
Yeah, what's up?

467
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
I have to go to Seoul this weekend,

468
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,730
and I wonder if you could let me stay for one night.

469
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,900
Oh, I have to go on a business trip, so I won't be in Seoul for a while.

470
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
I'll call you when I'm back.

471
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,400
 Okay, got it. 

472
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,300
Yeah.

473
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,500
Liar.

474
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,900
Why? What did she say?

475
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,400
Kang Hee handed out business cards to people at the funeral, didn't she?

476
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,800
But the others were so suspicious that I called to check.

477
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,667
But they said there's no such person.

478
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,667
But she said that she's at the company now.

479
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,867
She even says she'll be on a business trip during the weekend.

480
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,167
She must have some kind of trouble, too.

481
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,400
That's probably the case. But she should be able to tell me.

482
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,500
Why doesn't she even tell me?

483
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,267
I'm hurt.

484
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:16,533
Excuse me, could you help me with this?

485
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,633
No.

486
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:22,433
Come here, oh my, cutie.

487
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,067
That's right, that's right.

488
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,133
- Thank you. 
 - Come this way.

489
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,733
Oh, got it.

490
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:35,300
Thank you.

491
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,500
Come in.

492
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,000
- You're from the veterinary department, right? 
 - Oh, yes.

493
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Could you let go of this, please? I really need to hurry.

494
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,300
They're all test dogs, aren't they?

495
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,833
Yes.

496
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,067
I really need to go quickly.

497
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:59,867
Oh, wait a moment. What are you doing now?

498
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,100
Just a moment, I'll explain.

499
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,500
Yeah, are you busy?

500
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,200
Sorry, but could you come quickly to the school?

501
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,500
Please help me. No.

502
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,300
Yeah, come quickly. Thank you.

503
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,200
I really struggled to help these dogs escape.

504
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,800
Let me explain.

505
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,300
Where did you just call?

506
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,100
I can't take a single step until they arrive.

507
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,967
What are you doing…

508
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,467
I really had a hard time freeing these dogs.

509
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,800
Yeah? Please help me just once.

510
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,333
Please.

511
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,700
- Thank you, senior. 
 - Yes.

512
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,233
I managed to help them escape with great difficulty.

513
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,900
Without even knowing properly…

514
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,833
Are they for drug testing? Toxicity testing?

515
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,633
Euthanasia may be performed depending on the results.

516
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:53,433
Have you ever heard of "Footsteps of Sharing"?

517
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,100
Of course, they protect abandoned dogs and also support the adoption of experimental dogs.

518
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,500
That's the club I created when I was in school, dealing with similar struggles like yours.

519
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,367
Make sure to stop by if you have time.

520
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,500
"Footsteps of Sharing"…

521
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:09,500
Then, are you perhaps Senior Cheon Yeon Soo?

522
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Hello. My name is Yoon Nan Woo, class of 2016.

523
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
Thank you very much, Senior.

524
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Don't worry too much about them. They'll be fine.

525
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,733
Let's go, Ah Reum.

526
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
Oh, hello?

527
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,867
Hello.

528
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
Why? What's the matter?

529
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,300
I have something to ask you.

530
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,400
Yes, what is it? Ask away.

531
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,400
This might sound a bit strange,

532
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
and you might feel a bit offended.

533
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,000
It's okay, ask. What is it?

534
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,500
By any chance, are you Senior Yeon Soo's girlfriend?

535
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,800
What?

536
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:16,000
Girlfriend…

537
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,467
I'm just his friend.

538
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,367
Oh, that's a relief.

539
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:26,700
Then, by any chance, does he have a girlfriend?

540
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,200
It turns out he is really popular,

541
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,700
and there are actually so many people who claim to be his girlfriend.

542
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,267
That's all nonsense. Yeon Soo doesn't have a girlfriend.

543
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:38,500
But why are you curious about that?

544
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,600
That day he helped the beagles, and every time I see him,

545
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,900
he gives me a lot of advice about my worries.

546
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm just really grateful to him for so many things.

547
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,100
- I want to buy him a meal at least once… 
 - And?

548
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,600
Senior Yeon Soo… Do you happen to know what he's doing on Christmas Eve?

549
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,600
I don't know either, go ask him.

550
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,900
Please tell me.

551
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,600
I really don't know. Ask Yeon Soo.

552
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,467
It's fine, it's fine. I really need to do it.

553
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:09,933
   

554
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,760
   
   

555
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:23,500
Ready, one, two.

556
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,600
Okay, great.

557
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,000
Friends.

558
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
- Esther. 
 - Esther, congratulations.

559
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,600
- Thank you. 
 - Aren't you nervous?

560
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,200
- Are you okay? 
 - The dress is so beautiful.

561
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,900
All right, I'm going to take a photo.

562
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,300
One, two, three.

563
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,500
Smile a bit more, please. Yes, one, two, three.

564
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,290
♫  Close your eyes and feel me here  ♫

565
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,720
♫  What color is in your mind?  ♫

566
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:05,200
♫  Blue, dark gray, calm and sweet  ♫

567
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,000
♫  I can give you all  ♫

568
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,800
♫  Please tell me if you're standing here for me  ♫

569
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,700
♫  Far across the dream, just call my name  ♫

570
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,900
♫  Who's standing over the river  ♫

571
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,120
♫  Here I am  ♫

572
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:37,700
Kang Hee.

573
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,433
Kang Hee.

574
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,533
Congratulations.

575
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:46,033
Thank you.

576
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,700
Do you want to come to the after-party later?

577
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,767
I have a prior appointment.

578
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:54,333
Then let's meet up later.

579
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,500
Director.

580
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,400
- Oh? Lipstick! Right? 
 - Yes.

581
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,167
I knew it would suit you.

582
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:16,500
Oh, right. I heard you refused the design fee?

583
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,800
Why did you do that? Seok Kyeong has a lot of money.

584
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,433
- It was because of you. 
 - Me?

585
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:24,467
Thanks to you, Director.

586
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:28,533
I wanted to live a more luxurious life.

587
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,200
Not living so aggressively.

588
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,200
Kang Hee, I love you.

589
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,733
You said you liked men.

590
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,210
I won't ask to live together.

591
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,667
Instead, let's work together.

592
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,800
I left the company because of you, Ms. Kang Hee.

593
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,700
Pardon?

594
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,833
I kept thinking about what you said.

595
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:52,867
The luxury of not working with people I dislike.

596
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:55,867
I wanted to experience that luxury once, too.

597
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:59,833
So now you're responsible for me, Ms. Kang Hee.

598
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,400
Let's talk with a new year's fresh mood.

599
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:09,167
It's been a while.

600
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:12,533
- It's been such a long time. 
 - Right.

601
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,200
Wow.

602
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:24,367
What? Am I that pretty?

603
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,300
Korean makeup is truly the best.

604
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,000
I admit it.

605
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:33,033
Be happy.

606
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:36,967
You'll regret it for life, letting me go.

607
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,500
- Huh? 
 - See?

608
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,200
It looks like your eyes are full of regret.

609
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,233
Sorry to say this, but I've met a girl I like.

610
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:46,300
- Are you serious? 
 - Yes.

611
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
That's good to hear.

612
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,933
I felt bad for being the only one married.

613
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,900
But why didn't you come together?

614
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,800
You're asking me to bring her here, where my parents are?

615
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,133
When will you introduce her?

616
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,533
Soon.

617
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:24,033
There was an industrial spy here.

618
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,433
Then go ahead and report me.

619
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,200
I guess these days, everyone uses spruce trees.

620
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,167
Because it's much more splendid than a fir.

621
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,800
Didn't you say you had plans?

622
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,233
It's an evening appointment, so there's still some time.

623
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:45,933
Oh? Then, do you want to go and check out the top floor's suite?

624
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:51,000
It's not that, it's an after-party.

625
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,400
I'll be partying all night there, so come after your appointment.

626
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,933
We've also booked a room and will be up all night.

627
00:46:57,933 --> 00:47:00,967
Oh, sorry.

628
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:04,133
On a day like today, you naturally spend it with your boyfriend.

629
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,167
Have a good time, then.

630
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:34,433
 Welcome. 

631
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,567
 - Chun Pil, do you have money? 

632
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:49,167
 Huh? Do you need money? 

633
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:54,467
 Why? 

634
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:58,067
 I asked if you need money. 

635
00:47:58,067 --> 00:47:59,900
 Be quiet. 

636
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:23,533
 We share the same birthday. December 25th. 

637
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,567
 It's incredible. 

638
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,567
 Your birthday is calculated by the lunar calendar. 

639
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:33,500
 Let's make both of them Christmas, so it's easy to remember. 

640
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,933
 That wouldn't be respectful to the grandmother who gave birth to you. 

641
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:42,433
 All right, then I'll be the one who's unfilial. 

642
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,000
 You do the filial duty. 

643
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,867
 Why should I? 

644
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,033
 How nice is it? 

645
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:52,233
 On such a wonderful day, it's so great to meet once a year, 

646
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:55,633
 celebrate our birthdays, 

647
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,333
 and spend Christmas together. 

648
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,633
 Come here. 

649
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,300
 Like this, 

650
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,500
 we will be together for life. Okay? 

651
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,833
 One, two, three. 

652
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:17,367
I should have rejected it back then.

653
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,633
What time is it?

654
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:26,867
   

655
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,533
 Happy birthday. 

656
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:37,167
You remembered my birthday.

657
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:40,600
Of course, we were close for so long.

658
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,667
What about now? Aren't we close anymore?

659
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,633
We all scattered, you know.

660
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,867
That's right, I heard Han Woo is proposing today.

661
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:53,067
 She's a female coworker at the same company, and they've been dating for a while. 

662
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:54,200
What about Seung Eon?

663
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:05,800
I don't know.

664
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,267
If he's not working, he's probably off to the mountains or something.

665
00:50:08,267 --> 00:50:11,367
 Are you meeting Mr. Chun Pil at the hotel again today? 

666
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,033
Yeah.

667
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,233
But why don't you ask?

668
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,500
The person you really want to ask about is Yeon Soo, isn't it?

669
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:25,133
What about Yeon Soo?

670
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,800
Is he okay? Is he doing well?

671
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,300
 Oh, don't even mention it. 

672
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,033
 Kim Heon Yeol's father was making a big fuss, 

673
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:36,240
 calling the police and threatening to sue Yeon Soo. 

674
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,133
 Your father stopped them. 

675
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:40,733
He suffered because of me.

676
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,667
I should give him a call later and apologize.

677
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,633
 Yeah, but if you're going to do it, do it quickly. 

678
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:46,500
Why?

679
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,700
Yeon Soo might have…

680
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,600
He might have a date in the evening.

681
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:30,867
   

682
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,467
Hello, hello.

683
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,000
Hello?

684
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,867
 Is this Cheon Yeon Soo? 

685
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:50,033
Oh, Kang Hee.

686
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,833
 Senior. 

687
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:57,800
Wow, you look great today.

688
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,267
Huh?

689
00:52:00,233 --> 00:52:02,500
No, Kang Hee, hold on.

690
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:04,967
Just a minute.

691
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:07,600
Please go ahead and make the call. I'll go and order.

692
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,200
It seems like you're with someone else right now? Let's talk later.

693
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,967
 No, Kang Hee, that's not it… 

694
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:16,700
Kang Hee.

695
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:25,933
Timing is…

696
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:30,133
Chun Pil, let's not meet today.

697
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:33,033
 Suddenly? Why? Is something wrong? 

698
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:34,900
I'm over thirty now.

699
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,933
I don't want to receive a birthday congratulation from you, Chun Pil.

700
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:41,533
Until another man comes into your life, I should take care of it.

701
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,500
There is another man.

702
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,167
Then bring him along.

703
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,200
Chun Pil.

704
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,200
After checking in, I'll send you a text.

705
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,167
Let's meet in the room later.

706
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,800
Chun Pil.

707
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:09,300
Ms. Kang Hee.

708
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,133
Shall we sit together?

709
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,100
If you promise not to talk to me…

710
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,967
Let's just drink in silence, both of us.

711
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,533
 Elitree Hotel, Room 2020. 

712
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,267
Can I ask you a favor?

713
00:53:51,467 --> 00:53:53,400
Let's listen to it first.

714
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:57,233
There is a man claiming ownership of me.

715
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:00,533
I want to get away from that man.

716
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,267
Can I use you, Mr. Seok Kyeong?

717
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:19,700
Could I… just link arms with you for a moment?

718
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,667
I'm Geum Seok Kyeong.

719
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,667
 It's that man.

 Wow. 

733
00:56:51,067 --> 00:56:54,800
 Who would have thought to see such a stage at a Korean beef festival? 

734
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,090
Please give them another big round of applause.

735
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:08,100
 Ahjussi, now will you please tell me where Kang Hee lives? 

736
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,333
 Well… 

737
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:12,567
 Please tell us, mister. 

738
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:16,633
 We agreed to let him know once we perform. Otherwise, he won't be able to hold on anymore. 

739
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:21,867
 I heard she's in a goshiwon in Sillim-dong. 

740
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,300
 - What goshiwon? 
 - Oh, that's… 

741
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,533
 I promised her I wouldn't tell. 

742
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:28,967
 What kind of father says that? Please tell me. 

743
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:32,000
 Isn't it cool? Meeting just once a year at the end of the year. 

744
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,233
 Discussing life in a luxury hotel, 

745
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,300
 discussing movies and music, 

746
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,500
 dining with the best room service. 

747
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,300
 Then parting ways cleanly, just like we do. 

748
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:48,567
 Mister, please tell me. I will really get angry. 

749
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:49,933
 Move aside, you punk. 

750
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,900
 No, I'll stick to you until you tell me. 

751
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,467
 You brat. 

752
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:56,833
 Han Woo, is there a convenience store in the subway too? 

753
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:57,700
 Be quiet. 

754
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,633
 Oh, Han River! Han River! 

755
00:57:59,633 --> 00:58:01,267
 Wow, it's really long. 

756
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:03,700
 I said be quiet, you country bumpkin. 

757
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,700
 Why? You are a country bumpkin too. 

758
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,667
 Oh my. 

759
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,000
 These are all goshiwon. 

760
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,400
 When will we find her here? 

761
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,133
 There are really a lot. 

762
00:58:12,867 --> 00:58:14,533
 Ask that person over there. 

763
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,267
 You ask him. 

764
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:17,733
 You do it. 

765
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:20,200
 - You just ask him. 
 - Just once. 

766
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,633
 All right, all right. 

767
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:23,533
 Hello, sir. 

768
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:26,900
 Is there a person named Ji Kang Hee living here? 

769
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,400
 She's about this tall, and she's a girl. 

770
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,233
   

771
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:34,333
 Wow, is there a goshiwon in a place like this? 

772
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,133
 It's right up there at the top. 

773
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:38,967
 Let's go up there and then grab some food. 

774
00:58:38,967 --> 00:58:41,167
 Let's go quickly. 

775
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,867
 I'll go ahead. 

776
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:44,800
 Let's eat Korean beef, Korean beef. 

777
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,000
 Next time we come up here, we should also stop by the convenience stores. 

778
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,200
 Ah Reum said that Kang Hee is working part-time at a convenience store. 

779
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:55,333
 Then, 

780
00:58:55,933 --> 00:59:00,367
 you're going to visit every convenience store in downtown Seoul? 

781
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:02,700
 Yeah, we can just start with the ones nearby. 

782
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,333
 This is like looking for a needle in a haystack, Yeon Soo. 

783
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,033
 Just give up. 

784
00:59:07,033 --> 00:59:08,667
 Why are you so negative? 

785
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:15,333
 As long as I'm looking for her, we're still under the same sky in Seoul. 

786
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:19,700
 Maybe Kang Hee is also looking at that moon right now with me, right? 

787
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:21,800
 You crazy. 

788
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:25,667
 If you're going to do it, do it on your own. I can't do it anymore. 

789
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,567
 - I can't do it anymore. 
 - Why? Let's go together. 

790
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:29,500
 Why go together? How long will it take to find her? 

791
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,167
 - But we're friends. 
 - That's not it. 

792
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,600
 There are too many convenience stores. There's one over there, and also behind there. 

793
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,267
 I won't eat it. 

794
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:40,100
 Don't eat. If you keep eating like this, you'll need insulin next year. 

795
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,167
 You… Where are you going? 

796
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,867
 To buy dessert. 

797
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:45,600
 Oh my. 

798
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,533
 Hello. 

799
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:53,867
 Is there another part-time worker here? 

800
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:15,680
♫  Don't stop, keep coming slowly towards me  ♫

801
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,560
♫  Hear my heart, close your eyes  ♫

802
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:30,770
♫  I'll do everything, no matter how far away you are  ♫

803
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:38,290
♫  Running towards you, out of breath, 
 I will hug you  ♫

804
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:45,660
♫  I tried waiting for a long time  ♫

805
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,300
 I found her. 

806
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,733
 You go in and out of hotels with older men, don't you? 

807
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:14,167
 It's none of your business who I go to a hotel with. 

808
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:15,467
 How much do you get paid to do that? 

809
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:18,533
 Don't worry about how much I'm getting, just give me the overdue salary. 

810
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:21,300
 Do you really need to be reported to come to your senses? 

811
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,067
 You should be thankful that I haven't reported you for sponsoring prostitution. 

812
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:27,033
 If you don't pay my overdue salary right now, I'll be the one to report you. 

813
01:01:27,033 --> 01:01:29,833
 You're just a pathetic pervert, trying to hit on people under the guise of a part-time job. 

814
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,467
 Do you think I'd go to a hotel with you for that? 

815
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:32,900
 What? 

816
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,467
 Pathetic pervert? 

817
01:01:35,467 --> 01:01:36,767
 How dare… 

818
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:39,500
 Say it again, say it again! Say it again! 

819
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,167
 How dare… 

820
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,700
 What the heck. 

821
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,333
 What did you say? 

822
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,467
 Did you just say "heck" now? 

823
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:52,200
 How dare you… 

824
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,333
 Oh, hold on. 

825
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:57,033
 I've recorded videos of him abusing you, so report him with this. 

826
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,433
 It looks like you'll be the one getting reported, Boss. 

827
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:02,100
 My arm is going to fall off. 

828
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,267
 Stay still. 

829
01:02:04,267 --> 01:02:06,667
 Let go of my arm, and then we can talk. 

830
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:08,067
 Oh, just a second, my arm, my arm! 

831
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:09,333
 Stay still. 

832
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,400
 Oh my, my arm is going to fall off. 

833
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,867
 Oh, hold on. Let go of my arm, and then we can talk. 

834
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,167
 Drink this and go back. 

835
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:32,033
 You too, this… 

836
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,400
 Why are you giving me this? 

837
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:42,267
 There are many people who make things hard for me, even without you. 

838
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:44,500
 So don't come looking for me again. 

839
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:48,800
 This isn't a request, but an order. 

840
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:04,367
 - I'll send you the video. 
 - Thank you. 

841
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,167
 - Here. 
 - Yes. 

842
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:10,167
 Oh yes, just a moment, please. 

843
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,133
 Yes, it's done. 

844
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:15,100
 - Thank you. 
 - Yes. 

845
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:51,100
Please transfer the ownership of Kang Hee to me.

846
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:54,733
I will take responsibility for her.

847
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:05,250


848
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,700
   

849
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:26,370
♫  I end up quietly looking into your eyes  ♫

850
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:33,990
♫  The love inside me keeps growing  ♫

851
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,860
 Hey, it's because Chun Pil. 

852
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,880
 Let's work together. Come to our hotel's design team. 

853
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,910
 You said you were the hotel heir, but it was a scam. 

854
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,330
 I contacted you believing you were a hotel designer. 

855
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,110
 Hotels, so what? Motels can't do? 

856
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,730
 What does the hotel family's son know? 

857
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,600
 You don't know unless you're from a motel family. 

858
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,150
 Born in a motel, raised in a motel, all the way. 

859
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:56,570
 The gazes of those looking at me. Do you know what I have been through? 

860
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,840
 Will Seoul be very cold, too? 

861
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,380
 If it's cold and tough, you can always come back. 

862
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,540
 I'll wait. 

863
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,840
 What do I do if you show up unannounced like this? 

864
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,760
 Don't stare at me like that. 

865
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,560
 It makes my heart flutter.
