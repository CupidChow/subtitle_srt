What's going on?

28
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,280
Your woman actually
became your brother's?

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,079
Lu Haoran was just messing around.

30
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,359
It doesn't matter anyway.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,799
Someone else

32
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,239
will own her by today.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,560
Master Qin,

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,690
you misunderstood me.

35
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,079
I didn't bring her to...

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Eldest Young Master Lu.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,439
You're the legitimate eldest son
of your family.

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,719
Before this,

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,580
you were only able to scrap by with the leftovers

40
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,120
given to you by your younger brother.

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,079
But now,

42
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,879
the tables are able to turn soon.

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,159
Guanghe.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,690
I heard that the Lu family
got a new daughter-in-law.

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,060
Now that I'm looking at her in person,

46
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,439
she's indeed beautiful and capable.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,159
Mr. Qin,

48
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,960
Second Young Master Lu
was just joking around.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,599
I knew it.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,319
Ms. Lin, with your graceful demeanor,

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,039
you should be getting a better partner.

52
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,280
Master Qin,

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,970
it's almost time
for the signing ceremony.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,879
Look at how forgetful I am.

55
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,199
I left the contract

56
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,280
at the tea room.

57
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,390
It's inconvenient
for Eldest Young Master Lu

58
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,360
to walk around.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,000
Ms. Lin, why don't you do it
on his behalf?

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,639
No problem.

61
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,280
Please.

62
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,479
Ms. Lin.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,639
Please.

64
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,159
Mr. Qin,

65
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,080
are you an old acquaintance of Guanghe?

66
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,890
I've been acquaintances
with the two Lu brothers

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,520
for many years.

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
Aren't you Second Young Master Lu's fiancee?

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,879
Second Young Master Lu was just joking around.

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm Lu Guanghe's fiancee.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,970
I know that Second Young Master Lu

72
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,639
is known for being a playboy.

73
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,260
But I never expected him
to flirt with his sister-in-law.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,000
That is so inappropriate.

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Where's Lin Mange?

76
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,199
Don't tell me
you left her to Qin Wenyuan?

77
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,279
This wine is excellent.

78
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

79
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,860
It's excellent indeed.

80
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,790
Mr. Liu is looking for you.

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,199
Okay.

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Lin Mange?

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,040
Lin Mange?

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,759
Qin Wenyuan!

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,560
Lu Haoran,

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,319
do you think this is your house?

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,279
Lin Mange,

88
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,290
you're pretty free, aren't you?

89
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,380
Guanghe's leg ailment
is acting up again.

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Hurry and check on him.

91
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,040
Mr. Qin,

92
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,279
it's nothing major.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
It's just a case of weak digestion.

94
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,439
Just take care of your diet,
and you'll be fine.

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600

101

Mr. Qin.

102
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,880
Do you have time for an interview?

103
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,920
Please.

104
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,150
The Lu family and the Qin family
are having a collaboration.

105
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,690
This is something
truly worth celebrating.

106
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,920
Mr. Qin, are you going to purchase
the Lu family's textile factory?

107
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,290
That's right, Mr. Qin.

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,610
(Sales contract)
Why did you offer to purchase it

109
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,590
with a higher price than the market?

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,560
You might be able to stop me for now,

111
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,660
but you won't be able
to stop me forever.

112
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,490
Let's just wait and see, then.

113
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:42,380
(Representative: Qin Wenyuan)

114
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,560
Master Lu,

115
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,820
I heard that your family's textile factory
is about to go bankrupt.

116
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,959
Is that true?

117
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,660
According to the rumors,

118
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,980
you and Second Young Master Lu
didn't have the same mother.

119
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,990
Rumor has it
that you're joining hands with Mr. Qin

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,300
to take all of the Lu family's assets

121
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,290
by using the purchase
of the textile factory as your excuse.

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,399
Is that true?

123
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,160
Mr. Reporter,

124
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,279
don't listen to hearsay.

125
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,990
Don't take all rumors seriously.

126
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,160
Everyone,

127
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,480
the Lu family's textile factory
has 300 workers.

128
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,399
The factory is almost out of business.

129
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,240
I'm doing a kind deed right now.

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,879
Why am I being criticized instead?

131
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,639
Precisely.

132
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:35,879
This is bad!

133
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,399
The textile factory is on fire!

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,679
What?

135
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,799
That's right.

136
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,399
Guanghe!

137
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,360
This is an emergency.

138
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,240
Why don't we deal with the fire first?

139
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,240
Did you do it?

140
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,879
Don't worry.

141
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,600
It's just a pile of scrap.

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,559
Lu Haoran,

143
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,370
if you don't agree with my purchase
of the textile factory,

144
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,170
it's not like
there's no other way around it.

145
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,639
That map is useless to you anyway.

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Just do Marshal Lian a favor
and hand it to him.

147
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,370
If so, you won't
need to suffer this much.

148
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,679
It's not that I don't want
to hand it to him.

149
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
I lost it.

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
Even if I do find it,

151
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,770
I'm more worried about the fact
that we might have to change our surname.

152
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,639
What if my brother and I

153
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,080
become like you?

154
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,519
What if we become
Marshal Lian's lackeys?

155
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,960
No. 66, Victory Street.

Ms. Lin, take care.

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,580

How did a beautiful lady like you

171
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,600
get separated from the rest?

172
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,840
I guess I was separated from them.

173
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,200
It's fine. Let me send you back.

174
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,200
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

175
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,990
My car is over there.

176

It's likely that Second Young Master Lu

177
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,639
was the one who sabotaged
the signing ceremony.

178
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,559
This is major news.

179
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,480
We have to include this in the news
when we head back.

180
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:52,879
Yeah. Let's go.

181
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,720
Second Young Master Lu,
I just sent Eldest Young Master back home.

182
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,660
You foiled their plan
and sent Eldest Young Master home

183
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,840
by just burning a pile of scrap.

184
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,000
Second Young Master Lu, excellent job.

185
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,650
Where's the woman
I told you to keep an eye on?

186
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,130
Second Young Master!

187
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,879
Ms. Lin,

188
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,960
you shouldn't force yourself
when you can't hold your liquor well.

189
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,000
The prettier a woman is,

190
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,120
the easier her life should be.

191
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,399
Mr. Qin,

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
how could one blame others

193
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
for their melancholy, don't you agree?

194
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,879
Ms. Lin,

195
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,840
my subordinate told me

196
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,960
that he saw you arguing with
Second Young Master Lu on the streets

197
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,990
and tearing a map into shreds
just a few days ago.

198
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,399
