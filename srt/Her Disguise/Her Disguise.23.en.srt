27
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,280
Marshal Lian says
he wants me to be his woman.

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,959
I should have killed him.

29
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,560
You secretly took out the map

30
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,400
and the pistol.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,390
Are you planning the assassination?

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,599
How could I let you face danger alone?

33
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,280
Even if the assassination succeeds,

34
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,120
we would still face certain death.

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,400
But now he knows about the map.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
What should we do?

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
After you finish drawing the entire map,

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,439
I'll have my men

39
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,159
start moving the items out gradually.

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,200
Most of it has already been relocated.

41
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,840
Leave some behind

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
to keep them satisfied.

43
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,360
Who is it?

44
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,719
Who's there?

45
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,159
It's me.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,879
What are you doing?

47
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,479
It's late.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,039
It's time to sleep.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,759
I have good news.

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,439
Mange is going to become
the Marshal's woman.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,520
Mange just told me

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,080
that the Marshal wants to marry her.

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,159
Mange.

54
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,199
Mange.

55
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,520
Mange.

56
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,890
Eldest Young Master.

57
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,080
Young Madam was taken away
by the Marshal

58
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,560
to treat the women
in the Marshal's residence.

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,319
Guanghe.

60
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,479
Better get used to it.

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,919
Mange will be
in the Marshal's residence often.

62
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,159
That's how it was with Lanlan.

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,639
At least

64
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,800
she secured land for the Lu family.

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,199
If Mange does well,

66
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,840
you'll benefit too.

67
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,719
Qin Wenyuan is nothing now.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,199
The Marshal doesn't even regard him.

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
We'll have to rely on Mange's influence.

70
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,759
Mange is not Lanlan.

71
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,360
I won't allow the Lu family

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,479
to have a second Lanlan.

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,759
Mange isn't your wife yet.

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,319
Anyone can compete with you.

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
Wife?

76
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,759
Married tomorrow?

77
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,660
I've already instructed the servants

79
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,600
to move the wedding forward.

80
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,000
Marshal Lian

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,879
can't openly compete with me for a wife

82
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,040
in front of everyone, right?

83
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,439
This is the only way for you
to escape his control.

84
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,800
Guanghe.

85
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,160
Tomorrow, I will be your wife.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
As long as I'm with you,

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm willing to endure any hardship

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,360
and face any danger

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,639
together with you.

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,519
Eldest Young Master.

91
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
The carriage is ready.

92
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,480
The wedding chapel is also prepared.

93
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,319
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

94
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,519
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

95
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,480
Congratulations!

96
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,000
The Lu family's marriage alliance
with the Marshal

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,600
is a tremendous advancement.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

99
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,040
What do you mean?

100
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,439
Your best days are still ahead.

101
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,279
Today, I'm here to take Ms. Lin Mange
as my wife.

102
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
You all can be witnesses
to the occasion.

103
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,720
Marshal Lian.

104
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,279
Do you want to openly compete with me

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
for a wife in front of everyone?

106
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,639
You're the one trying to take
another's wife.

107
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,120
Lu Guanghe.

108
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
What right do you have to marry her?

109
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,480
You're not even a true son of
the Lu family.

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,839
What right do you have?

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,680
This is the witness to father's last letter.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,079
But through him, I found a lawyer

113
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,199
with closer ties to the Lu family

114
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,399
who gave me a different version

115
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,839
of the last letter

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,720
with some notable changes.

117
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,240
Lu Guanghe is not my biological son.

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,759
He is the adopted son of
the First Madam's family.

119
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,720
I hope that my second son Haoran
will love and protect him,

120
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,600
treating him as if he were my child.

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,959
Lu Guanghe.

122
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,000
You forged the last letter,

123
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,279
drove me, the true Lu family heir, out,

124
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,399
and seized our family's wealth.

125
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,160
Tell me,

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,680
how could you still

127
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,439
stay in the Lu family?

128
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,480
No, no, it's not true.

129
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,639
It's not true.

130
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
It's not true.

131
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,319
No.

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,199
