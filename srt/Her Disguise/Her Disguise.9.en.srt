00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,159
Ms. Lin,

28
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,040
my subordinate told me

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,079
that he saw you arguing with
Second Young Master Lu on the streets

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,390
and tearing a map into shreds
just a few days ago.

31
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,719
Is that true?

32
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,640
Mange, I'm here to pick you up.

33
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,790
Second Young Master Lu,

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,879
you're truly concerned about
this beauty.

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,560
Ms. Lin was just hitching a ride

36
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,159
as she was drunk.

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,360
Mr. Qin, we don't live
on the same street.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,599
I don't think she needs to hitch a ride.

39
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,180
If not, she might be
heading in the wrong direction.

40
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,159
Go.

41
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,319
Lin Mange.

42
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,599
Are you silly?

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,199
Do you really think
that you can get her back

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,599
from that Qin
with your lousy skills?

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,670
Even so, few can stop
a desperate person.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,199
Listen, I won't tell you this again.

47
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,240
This mess isn't something
a woman can handle.

48
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,190
You better leave tomorrow.

49
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,680
You better leave tomorrow!

50
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,719
Leave?

51
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,080
Did you guys let Lanlan leave back then?

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,090
Second Young Master Lu,

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,039
so, all those dumb women
who died before this

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,479
are worthless to you all compared
to the things you guys desire, huh?

55
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,240
Listen up.

56
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,719
I've never depended on a woman.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,479
Tell me.

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,879
Who else desires this map?

59
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,599
Qin Wenyuan?

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,520

61
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,319
Don't move!

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,639
Lin Mange, do you know how dumb you are?

63
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,970
You're the dumbest woman in the world!

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,190

Qin Wenyuan is?

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,479

68

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400

75

It's because there's no one else.
