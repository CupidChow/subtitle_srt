But to be honest,

96
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,519
nothing happened

Qin Wenyuan couldn't find the map.

100
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,190
And he thinks
that we are worthless to him.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,090

they are working on?

104
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,480
An equity deal.

105
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,690
He's probably interested
in our textile factory.

106
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,759
Qin Wenyuan is doing this

107
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
to force you to give him the map.

108
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,120
Eldest Young Master is tempted.

109
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
Have you talked to Mr. Qin?

110
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,879
Yes.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,150
We talked about menial things

112
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,390
and appreciated
some Chinese paintings together.

113
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,120
You know

114
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,720
that I'm not interested in business.

115
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,180
A factory is already hard enough
for me to handle.

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Unlike you.

117
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300

120
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,799
You haven't forgotten what our father said
when he was still alive, right?

121
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
Guanghe is more unstable and
likes to go to the extreme.

122
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,600
And he's not as fit.

123
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,799
I'll leave the Lu family to you.

124
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,720

126
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,919
It's okay.

127
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,559
I have a weak body.

128
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,480
But my mind works just fine.

129
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,679
You don't have to remind me.

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
Guanghe.

131
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,759
I'll take good care of the Lu family.

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,159
You just need to draw, rest,
and grow some flowers.
