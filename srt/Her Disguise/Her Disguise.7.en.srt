Second Young Master, tonight,
Eldest Young Master will sign

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,590
the contract with Qin Wenyuan here.

29
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,159
We have to stop them.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
Just proceed with our plan.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Second Young Master Lu,

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,960
who's that girl on the dance floor?

33
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,840
Second Young Master Lu.

34
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,479
How have you been?

35
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,960
Master Qin.

36
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,400
I'll be fine

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,240
as long as you take
our past tie into account.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,159
Second Young Master Lu, what about you?

39
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,719
I've been looking after

40
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,120
the Lu family all these years.

41
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,520
But you?

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,960
But you stole the map
I told you to find.

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
How do you explain that?

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,520
Master Qin,

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,319
what are you saying?

46
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,159
I told you this long ago.

47
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,680
The military map

48
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,879
was left behind by
Lin Xi after his defeat.

49
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,080
Lin Xi was my father's acquaintance
before he passed away.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,080
He even instructed my family
to find the map for him.

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,159
Now that I've found it,

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,639
shouldn't my family
hold possession of it?

53
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,800
Master Qin,

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,039
your family has a huge ancestral hall.

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,850
You can pray
to all the deities you like.

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
But us?

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,479
We can only look after the items
left behind by our ancestors

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,639
and get by.

59
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,480
I'll make a move first.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Master Qin.

61
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,839
Ms. Zhao?

62
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:18,959
Come.

63
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,279
Long time no see.
You're become prettier.

64
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,120
Guanghe, I need to use the restroom.

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,180
Alright. I'll wait for you
on the second floor.

66
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:39,959
Alright.

67
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,560
It's crowded tonight.
No mishaps are allowed.

68
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,399
Yes.

69
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:43,959
Go now.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,079
Sorry about that.

71
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,279
Miss, may I know your name?

72
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,959
Were you talking to me?

73
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,120
Miss, the way you dance was exquisite.

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,240
It was a sight to behold.

75
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm Qin Wenyuan.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,279
Nice to meet you.

77
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,519
My name is Lin Mange.

78
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,580
Mr. Qin, I've long heard of your name.

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,120
Lin Mange.

80
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,660
Do you two know each other?

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,959
You two are?

82
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:35,920
I forgot.

83
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,790
Mr. Qin, I forgot
to introduce her to you.

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,759
This is

85
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,040
my beautiful fiancee,

86
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,600
Ms. Lin Mange.

87
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,360
Oh yeah.

88
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
We have something to discuss.

89
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,480
We'll stop bothering you.

90
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,319
Lu Haoran!

91
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,399
Are you addicted to acting?

92
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,079
Listen.

93
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,160
This place isn't suitable for you.

94
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,079
You better stay here

95
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,079
before the banquet is over.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,279
Don't go anywhere.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
Second Young Master Lu,
it appears like you don't want anyone else

98
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,800
to find out about the map, huh?

99
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
Seems like that map

100
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,439
is very important to you.

101
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,160
My dear sister-in-law.

102
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,040
Don't forget.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,439
We're in the same boat now.

104
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,079
We can't be separated.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,839
