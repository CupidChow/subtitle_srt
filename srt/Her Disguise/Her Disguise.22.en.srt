(Adapted from Shuiyue Xianling's novel, "Her Disguise")

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,860
=Episode 22=

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,850
- Why is it you?
- Let me introduce you.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,519
This is the Marshal's newly appointed
aide-de-camp.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,560
Lu Haoran.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,439
Guanghe.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,400
I didn't have time to inform you.

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,480
The Marshal has given me
a military position,

33
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,519
so I can no longer pull rickshaws.

34
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,400
I hope you understand.

35
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,680
What's going on with Lu Haoran?

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,799
This morning, he's suddenly become
the Marshal's man.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,050
I have to make way for him now.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,319
Today, with the Marshal here,

39
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,000
it's truly an honor.

40
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,760
Come.

41
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,560
Let's all raise a toast to the Marshal.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,919
Congratulations
on your triumphant return.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,800
Cheers!

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,439
Marshal, please.

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Marshal.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,599
This is the gift I prepared for you,

47
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,039
the one you wanted.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,159
(The true intentions are revealed.)

49
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,159
This...

50
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,800
Ms. Lin,

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,639
this gift is indeed what I desired.

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,479
At the Lu family's celebration,

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,360
there's one thing I don't understand.

54
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,199
Is Ms. Lin the wife
of Eldest Young Master Lu

55
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,560
or Second Young Master Lu?

56
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,890
Marshal, you can see clearly.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,599
Of course, she is
my elder brother's wife.

58
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,000
Now I understand.

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,160
Previously, when I asked for the map,

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,470
Eldest Young Master kept refusing.

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,519
It turns out he was afraid of
disobeying his wife.

62
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,439
Marshal, it's not that I didn't.

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
The map was...

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
It's because he didn't know

65
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
where the real map was.

66
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,759
Only I know

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
where

68
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,399
the true map is.

69
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,399
I've been waiting for
the Marshal to return.

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,680
Marshal.

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,800
This is the map.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,890
Why did it take you so long
to bring it here?

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,879
Marshal.

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,879
Everyone wants to take credit
by standing on my shoulders.

75
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,519
I won't let that happen.

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,639
Why not keep such opportunities
for myself?

77
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,370
Second Young Master Lu.

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Now you're my aide-de-camp.

79
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
Go to investigate.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
Yes.

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,079
If everything is true,

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,680
I will continue to promote you.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,079
Marshal.

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,160
Since my younger brother
provided the map,

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
as the elder,

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,879
I cannot fall behind.

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,079
Therefore,

88
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,600
the Lu family will sponsor

89
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,000
half of the travel expenses

90
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,560
for this treasure hunt.

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
Eldest Young Master Lu is indeed generous.

92
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,839
Naturally, I will keep up.

93
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,879
Cheers, Marshal.

94
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,759
I have a rough idea of

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,560
how Ms. Lin's map came to be.

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,519
However, I need you
to do one more thing.

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,839
Draw the map again

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
in front of me

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,000
so I can verify

100
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,920
that the one Lieutenant Lu gave me
is genuine.

101
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,879
- She doesn't remember.
- She doesn't remember.

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,879
She doesn't remember?

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,000
If she doesn't, how have you
managed to survive until now?

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Marshal, please this way.

105
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,120
Please, this way, Marshal.

106
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,000
Ms. Lin.

107
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,120
Good memory.

108
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Here's a small gift for you.

109
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,560
A woman

110
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,000
should treat herself well.

111
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,120
You didn't think I called you here

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
just to draw, did you?

113
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,680
Then what else?

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
The secret room

115
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,639
you uncovered at Qin Wenyuan's house

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,839
actually belongs to me.

117
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,439
I have copies

118
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,360
of all the photos of the women.

119
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
And you joined the Lu family

120
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,799
for her.

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,740
Marshal, why are you

122
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,320
being so open and direct?

123
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,399
Lanlan,

124
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,799
the woman of your fiancé Lu Guanghe.

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,279
This cripple wanted to ask me
for a piece of land

126
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,919
and sent Qin Wenyuan to negotiate.

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,120
I didn't agree.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Not long after,

129
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,759
this woman was sent to me,

130
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,519
and then he got the land.

131
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,279
Do you understand why?

132
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,000
I had originally planned to make her
a concubine,

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,320
but she insisted on returning to
Lu Guanghe.

134
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,720
Later,

135
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,279
I heard

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
she jumped to her death.

137
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,919
It's a pity.

138
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,639
If Lu Guanghe

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,960
can push one woman out,

140
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,679
he can push out another.

141
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,360
Ms. Lin,

142
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,639
do you still think you should marry him?

143
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,080
I've seen many women.

144
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
Some are lovely,

145
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,360
some obedient,

146
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,639
some alluring.

147
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,320
But none are like you,

148
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,360
smart and insightful.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Today,

150
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,519
I see you also have courage.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
Ms. Lin Mange,

152
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,440
I want you to come to
the Marshal's residence

153
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,919
and be my lady.

154
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,080
You already have many women.

155
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,679
How could someone as plain as me

156
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,600
ever catch your eye?

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,279
There are many women,

158
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
but most of them lack subtlety.

159
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,919
That's why the women in these photos

160
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,600
are all dead.
