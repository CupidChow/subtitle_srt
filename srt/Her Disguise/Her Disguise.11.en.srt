(Adapted from Shuiyue Xianling's novel, "Her Disguise")

=Episode 11=

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,000
Lu Guanghe? Do you suspect him?

28
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,840
It's not just Lu Guanghe.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,159
And Qin Wenyuan too.

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,000
How about Lu Haoran?

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm not sure yet.

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,840
I asked you to investigate Qin Wenyuan.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,519
How is it?

34
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,680
Qin Wenyuan likes
to make friends over tea.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,079
I heard that he stays away
from womanizing.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,560
It seems like the military force
is backing him up.

37
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,879
He's having a banquet
at the tea house tonight.

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,719
Don't park the car here. Move.

39
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:00,920
Here.

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,920
Master Qin, please.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,719
Excuse! Move!

42
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,080
I'm so sorry, miss!

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,960
Are you okay?

44
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,039
I'm fine.

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,319
I didn't watch my step.

46
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm so sorry.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,479
They pulled too fast,

48
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,479
I couldn't stop properly.

49
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,800
Are you... Are you injured?

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,479
I'm fine.

51
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm so sorry, Miss!

52
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,680
Please. Please forgive me.

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,680
Miss Lin, are you okay?

54
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,759
Move.

55
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,080
Are you injured?

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,439
I'm fine.

57
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,560
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,199
Something happened the other days

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,660
and I didn't get to spend time with you.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,599
I still have a lot of medical questions

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
for you.

62
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,039
Mr. Qin,

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,199
I'm always here if you need anything.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,439
Seriously, Lin Mange.

65
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,879
Where has she been?

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,400
She's always not around
when we need her.

67
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,319
Guanghe,

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
you can have all the women you want.

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
What's so great about her?

70
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,680
I said to kick her out,

71
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,800
but you and Haoran don't agree.

72
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,439
Eldest Young Master Lu,
Ms. Lin is visiting,

73
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,759
she'll not be going home tonight.

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,490
Second Young Master.

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,960
What is it? What's the panic?

76
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,840
Lin Mange went to Qin Wenyuan's house.

77
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,240
She hasn't come back yet.

78
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,120
Yuning.

79
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,879
You have to earn

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,039
what you want.

81
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,400
Haoran, wait for me!

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
Haoran, wait for me!

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,759
I'll show you Lin Mange's true colors.

84
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,560
It really feels good.

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,480
Ms. Lin is a master of her craft.

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,560
And the aroma is amazing.

87
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,480
You catch a chill very frequently.

88
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,879
It caused your sickness.

89
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,660
You'll feel better in a few days.

90
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,199
Sandalwood is good for calming.

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,839
It'll help your recovery.

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,839
I'll come back in a few days

93
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,360
and continue with
acupuncture treatments.

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,439
It's a lot of back and forth.

95
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,639
Ms. Lin, if you don't mind,

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,480
you can stay here for a few days.

97
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,240
Ms. Lin,

98
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
give it a thought.

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,319
Some of my friends

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,879
are suffering from sickness too.

101
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,839
They'll need your treatment too.

102
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Stay here for a few days.

103
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,800
You could be a great help.

104
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,079
I'm honored to be trusted

105
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,519
by Mr. Qin.

106
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,079
Ms. Lin can drink.

107
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,639
You flattered me.

108
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,879
Ms. Lin.

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,240
Mr. Qin.

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,439
Ms. Lin, I...

111
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,319
Why do I...

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
Mr. Qin, what happened?

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,920
I...

114
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,079
(This is the ecstasy powder I made)

115
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,199
(according to your formula.)

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Here's the antidote.

117
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,000
Remember to take it in advance.

118
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,600
Lanlan.

119
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,080
Mr. Qin.

120
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,720
I just

121
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
took a nap.

122
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,200
Ms. Lin, are you leaving?

123
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,440
I left my silver needle in the room.

124
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,680
I'm afraid it might hurt you by mistake
so I rushed to get it.

125
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I've got it now.

126
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,559
I'll make a move.

127
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,720
What's the rush, Ms. Lin?

128
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm serious about inviting you to stay.

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,519
I've called my friends.

130
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,960
They are on their way.

131
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,840
Ms. Lin,

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,360
I suppose you'll show me some respect.
