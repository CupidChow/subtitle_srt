all your friends.

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,090
Keep an eye on that woman

and keep me informed.

Excuse me.

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Make way.

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Miss, we are here.

49
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,240
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,020
(Kang Ji Pharmacy)

51
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,840
Thanks, boss.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,919
Boss.

54
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,039
Did you get the Oroxylum seed?

55
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,719
Get it inside.

56
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,960
Can you tell me

57
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,280
what this map is about?

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,879
Where did you get this?

59
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,960
From Lu Haoran.

60
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,360
I've heard

61
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,439
that the Lu family and the Lin family
were close friends.

62
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,960
General Lin left behind a lot of arms

63
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,560
after his death.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,159
Perhaps,

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,960
there is a big secret hidden in the map.

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,280
How about you?

67
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,479
What's the progress?

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
Lu Haoran

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,279
is a pain in the neck.

70
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,759
The seat is taken.

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,480
Don't you hear me?

72
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,879
No one is sitting now.

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,720
How is it?

74
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,839
This Qin guy is so annoying.

75
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,920
He's got people
watching us all the time.

76
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,639
Ms. Lin went to that clinic.

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,860
My eyes are hurt from watching,

78
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,240
(Kang Ji Pharmacy)
but I don't see her leaving yet.

79
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,670
I asked to investigate Qin Wenyuan.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,439
How is it going?

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,879
I've had someone reveal
his whereabouts to Qin Wenyuan.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,360
He will make a move on Lu Haoran today.

83
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,120
Not today.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,680
He has Cui.

85
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,790
This is not the right time.

86
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
It's too late.

87
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,480
Time to get an amulet.

88
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,380
Tell you what.

89
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,240
Check it out in the pharmacy.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,160
If she is indeed a spy,

91
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,610
we might as well teach her a lesson.

92
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,790
Let's split up
and meet at the usual place.

93
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,839
Here you go, Miss.

94
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,370
What kind of medicine do you want?

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,240
What's going on here?

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,399
They are Master Qin's men.

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,970
Go after them!

98
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,079
Leave it! Leave it!

99
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
What is wrong with you?

100
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,519
Lu Haoran!

101
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
Be a man!

102
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,079
Wait.

103
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,240
You're the one who deserted me

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,399
and you're the one who won't let go!

105
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,519
Man.

106
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,690
Let go of me!

107
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,519
You must believe me.

108
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,680
Let go of me!

109
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,660
Let's go home and talk.

110
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,560
Let go of me!

111
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,920
Lin Mange, you...

112
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,000
Where were you when your mom

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,519
humiliated me with money?

114
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,439
Where were you

115
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,680
when she undressed me piece by piece

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,360
to prove my innocence?

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,360
Now you want me to forgive you.

118
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,480
Fine!

119
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,639
Then take off your clothes
in front of everyone.

120
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,879
Do you dare to do so?

121
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,079
If he were my son,

122
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,399
I'd break his legs.

123
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,720
Let's take a look.

124
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,680
What's going on here?

125
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,839
Let's take a look.

126
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,360
Go ahead!

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,159
So fit.

128
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
Indeed.

129
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
Is that good enough for you?

130
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,799
Are you satisfied?

131
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,720
No.

132
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,799
Your mom humiliated me with these.

133
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,440
I'll give it back to you!

134
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
Money! Money!

135
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,799
Money!

136
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,120
(General Lin left behind a lot of arms
after his death.)

137
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,480
(Perhaps, there is a big secret
hidden in the map.)

138
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,519
And this is your family's treasure.

139
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,120
(Time to get an amulet.)

140
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,080
(What do you mean?)

141
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,000
Since this map is so important...

142
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,320
I'll give it all back to you.

143
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,950
I have to become
the replacement for this map.

144
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,480
We are getting rich!

145
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,440
Lin Mange!

146
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,799
Stop grabbing!

147
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,360
It's mine!

148
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,960
It's mine!

149
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,960
We are getting rich!

150
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,519
Move!

151
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,399
Hey...

152
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,280
What are you doing here?

153
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,120
Where is he?

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,840
I guess I underestimated you.

155
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
Miss!

156
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,840
Here's a flower for you.

157
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,639
Thank you.

158
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,559
Young Master Lu, enjoy.

159
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,080
Young Master.

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,639
My mission is completed.

161
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,840
What is it?

162
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,519
I've sent someone
to lure Ms. Lin to 66 Victory Street.

163
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,600
(The person you're looking for,
66 Victory Street)

164
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,200
66 Victory Street.

165
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,360
Cui!

166
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,540
Something is wrong with the pharmacy
that she goes to.

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,799
When we're done with her,

168
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,240
we can end this place too.

169
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,039
Then you'll be at peace.

170
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,039
Would it kill you to be lazy
just for once?

171
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,480
When did you become so efficient?

172
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,960
I...

173
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,480

Qian.

175

I promise you'll be satisfied.

176
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,480
What kind of woman

177
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,360
makes you so confident?

178
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,519
Just take a look and you'll know.

179
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,200
Let's go.

180
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,799
Don't make me come
all the way here for nothing.

181
