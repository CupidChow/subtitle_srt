=Her Disguise=
(Adapted from Shuiyue Xianling's novel, "Her Disguise")

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,860
=Episode 15=

27
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,599
Tonight I'm meeting Mr. Zhang
from the North

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,079
and Ms. Zhao from the South.

29
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,359
Just deliver the map

30
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,560
and we'll be rich.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,640
Master Qin.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,680
It's returned.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
It's returned?

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,200
What did the marshal say?

35
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,959
The marshal said the map was real.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,079
But the most important parts
are missing,

37
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,319
making the final location
of the weapon missing.

38
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,300
The marshal wants you
to pursue the case.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,799
Looks like

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,479
we're still missing the last step.

41
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,360
We have to do better than that.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,840
Pinching either one of them
is a breakthrough.

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,960
Who do you think

44
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,240
we should go after?

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,919
You're a beast.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Yes.

47
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm a beast.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
You're my plaything.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,120
I could be even more wild.

50
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,680
Lu Haoran.

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,919
Guanghe.

52
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,719
If you don't appreciate and cherish her,

53
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
you might as well hand her over to me.

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,159
I'll make her the true young madam
of the Lu family.

55
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,439
If you care for her,

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,919
why did she end up getting shot?

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
Mange has become like this

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
because of you.

59
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,840
How do you know

60
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,360
so much about this?

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you behind this?

62
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:15,879
You...

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,759
Stop spouting accusations.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Guanghe.

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,279
Since I joined the Lu family,

66
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,600
Lu Haoran has tormented and mocked me.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,959
I want you to make him leave.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,390
Second Young Master Lu, there's trouble.

69
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
What happened to Cui?

70
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,530
Didn't you keep an eye?

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
My hands are tied, Young Master.

72
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,680
When she was taken,

73
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,800
I was powerless to help.

74
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,800
I deliberately got close to that guy

75
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,920
to find out where he took her.

76
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,399
All good now.

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,639
All good now.

78
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,959
You must have been frightened.

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,519
Mange.

80
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,120
I won't let anyone
stand in our way again.

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,160
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,680
How did you get that map?

83
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,000
Did you get it from Haoran?

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,519
I can't recall at the moment.

85
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959
Let me think about it.

86
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,639
It's fine.

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,079
Guanghe.

88
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,360
I want to thank you.

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,959
You've been having Xiang
donate to the orphanage

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,240
and help my friends find jobs.

91
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,120
I've never told you,

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
but I was raised in an orphanage too.

93
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
That's our fate then.

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,519
No need to thank me.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,040
But one of my friends was taken
by Chunyi House.

96
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,079
Can you help me get her back?

97
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,560
With me around,

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,319
don't worry.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,480
Mange.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,079
Once you're better,

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,439
we'll get married.

102
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
What's wrong, Guanghe?

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,319
Are you feeling down?

104
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:40,959
Mange.

105
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,519
Last time you mentioned

106
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,959
your friend was taken by Chunyi House.

107
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,199
I've looked into it.

108
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,959
Any news? Did you find her?

109
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,040
Where is she?

110
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,890
She committed suicide
by running into a wall.

111
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,800
That's impossible.

112
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,399
My condolences.

113
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,200
I've arranged for her

114
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,519
to be buried in the cemetery.

115
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,120
Once you're better,

116
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,440
we'll visit her together.

117
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,200
Thanks.

118
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,159
Guanghe.

119
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,440
I only have you now.

120
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,440
I need you to love

121
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,279
and care for me.

122
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll stay by your side.

123
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,720
I want you to avenge me.

124
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
I'll do

125
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,960
whatever you say.

126
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,360
What's wrong?

127
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,159
There's trouble.

128
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,360
The workers are protesting.

129
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,720
The shareholders say

130
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,279
you're blocking Qin Wenyuan's investment

131
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,830
and have had disputes with the workers.

132
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,879
They're trying to force you
out of your position.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,130
There's a commotion at the factory.

134
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
This cunning man

135
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,320
caused our raw material suppliers

136
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
to pull out.

137
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,159
The workers are protesting.

138
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,840
And

139
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
the shareholders blame you

140
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,799
for Qin Wenyuan's lack of investment.

141
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,440
They say you're behind the current mess.

142
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,480
Second Young Master Lu.

143
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Did the workers hurt you
during the wage protests?

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,840
By resigning, are you admitting

145
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,240
to being involved?

146
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,260
Is it true you and your brother
are at odds?

147
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,039
Second Young Master Lu, please clarify.

148
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,000
Second Young Master Lu.

149
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,559
Second Young Master Lu.

150
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,960
It's not that we don't support you,

151
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,320
but the textile factory can't continue

152
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,279
(Lu's board slow to act during its term)
without the Chamber of Commerce's backing.

153
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,639
Mr. Qin is very upset now.

154
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,159
We're in a difficult position.

155
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,759
Please understand.

156
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Guanghe.

157
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,919
Are we being too harsh?

158
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,399
Yuning, don't worry.

159
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,639
I'll keep my promise.

160
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,200
But...

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,399
As long as something happens to him,

162
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,840
won't you have your chance?

163
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,639
At today's shareholders' meeting,
you're sick at home,

164
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,639
but all the shareholders
acted according to your wishes, Guanghe.

165
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,879
Sorry, Haoran.

166
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,320
It's not convenient to let you in today.

167
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,600
What do you mean?

168
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,390
(Last letter)

169
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,559
Open it.

170
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,720
This is father's last letter.

171
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,679
(Lu Haoran is not a biological son)
It says

172
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,759
Lu Haoran is adopted by
father's second wife,

173
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,919
not a biological son.

174
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,600
He can be expelled

175
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,639
for any mistakes made.

176
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,240
What trick are you playing?

177
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,000
I was there when father died.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
There was no note.

179
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,679
Father didn't want to hurt you,

180
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,200
so he kept it from you.
