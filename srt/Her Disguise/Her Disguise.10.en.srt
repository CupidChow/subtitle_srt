her.

we have to keep that woman here.

She was already booked.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,319
Why do you look

61
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,240
kind of familiar?

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,000
It's you!

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,080

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,199
- You guys can't take her away from me.
- Cui!

65
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,159
Come!

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,920
You two leave first.

67
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:32,680

68
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,680

69
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,639

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,199
Do you remember what Xiang looks like?

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,959
He covered his face.

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,560
I couldn't see his face clearly.

73
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,800
He took us to work at a boss's house.

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,879
After that,

75
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,759
that boss took us somewhere else.

76
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,240
No one expected it to be a trap.

77
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,790
You should rest
at Yong's pharmacy for a few days.

78
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll help you to settle down after this.

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,319
You must take care of yourself.

80
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,759
Mange,

81
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,439
don't go.

82
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,279
We're no match for them.

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Cui,

84
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,639
I'm not just doing it for our sake here.

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,439
How long have you two known each other?

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,959
Over 300 years.

87
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,639
What kind of attitude was that?

88
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,160
Lin Mange,

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,000
you owe me a favor this time.

90
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,199
What should I demand from you?

91
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,480
Hmm, I guess I have to think about it.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,920
Thank you.

93
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,560
You should leave the Lu family

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,600
and Lu Guanghe

95
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,990
after finishing the map.

96
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,560
Eldest Young Master, we were too late.

97
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
The girl we sent there before this

98
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,240
was already taken away.

99
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
I know.

100
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,240
Guanghe, I would never know

101
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
that you and Mr. Qin were this close

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
had I not witnessed it myself.

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,439
Haoran, it's all thanks to you.

104
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
Lanlan wasn't enough, huh?

105
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,580
Now, you're trying to drag
Lin Mange down as well.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,370
If you want something,
you can ask me for it.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,279
What's mine is mine.

108
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,320
I don't need to ask you for it.

109
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,199
Now, Lin Mange is mine.

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,839
You're wrong.

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,480
She doesn't belong to anyone.

112
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,600
Mange,

113
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,519
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,770
I've made you wait for too long.

115
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
You will always stay by my side, right?

116
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,290
I will always stay by your side.

117
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,039

118
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,559

119
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
