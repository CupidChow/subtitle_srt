27
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,480
Guanghe.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,159
Mange, you're quick to act.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,959
That's why you're my wife.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,159
You know me well.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,000
However, you can't just save him
without treating him.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
You have to cure him.

33
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,760
Otherwise,

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,519
as his sister-in-law,

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,319
you'll be heartbroken for him.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,240
Guanghe.

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,759
You must be kidding.

38

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,319
Today is a good day.

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,990
Young Master has been promoted
to President of the Chamber of Commerce.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,319
Of course.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,439
This achievement

43
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,919
is also partly due to you, Lu Haoran.

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,879
Today, let father see

45
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,120
who has brought honor to the Lu family.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,560

pulling a rickshaw

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,560
would still be a living for you.

50
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,639

Looks great.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,439
Let's go.

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,480
Both of you, have a seat.

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,360
Okay, look at the camera.

76
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,680
Smile.

77
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,079
Three, two...

78
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,780
Stop taking photos.

79
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:47,800
Get lost.

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,639
Hurry up.

81
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,199
Hurry.

82
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,360
Go.

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,040
This...

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
Sir, what happened?

85
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,560
The Marshal wants to see both of you.

86
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:01,879
Please follow me.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,199
Excuse me.

88
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,480
Marshal.

89
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,040
- Marshal.
- Stop.

90
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,199
I am Qin Wenyuan.

91
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,120
I am with the Marshal.

92
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,360
Marshal.

93
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,920
Marshal.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,279
Marshal, you're back.

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
As soon as I heard the news,

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
I hurried over.

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,040
Marshal, you must be weary

98
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,160
from your journey.

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,879
Are you tired?

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,879
We could find a place for you to rest.

101
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,800
Marshal.

102
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,839
This is the eldest son of the Lu family,
Lu Guanghe,

103
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,160
whom I've introduced to you before.

104
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,920
He is now the head of the Lu family

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
and the president of
the local Chamber of Commerce.

106
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,920
And beside him is...

107
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,000
I know.

108
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
Ms. Lin Mange.

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
You provided the previous map,
didn't you?

110
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,279
Yes.

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,879
Rewards are due for contributions.

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,170
I hear you're getting married,

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,250
so this is a congratulatory gift
for you.

114
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,120
Eldest Young Master Lu.

115
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll invite you and your wife to my home
for a meal another day.

116
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,720
Marshal.

117
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,600
I'll host a welcome dinner for you
another day.

118
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,040
At that time,

119
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,800
I hope Ms. Lin Mange

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
can bring a gift I have in mind.

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,519
Marshal.

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,199
Um,

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,519
go to my place, Marshal.

124
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,439
Give me a chance

125
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,160
to host you.

126
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,319
Marshal, please slow down.

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
Tomorrow is the day of the banquet.

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,160
You know what the Marshal wants.

129
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,600
Guanghe.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
I've told you many times.

131
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,319
I'm so scared right now

132
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,000
that I've forgotten all about the map.

133
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,079
I can't quite recall
how to recreate the original one.

134
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,879
I don't quite remember.

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,000
You've forgotten?

136
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,600
If we can't produce the map,
we're all done for.

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,079
Do you understand?

138
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm sorry, Mange.

139
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,279
I'm really sorry.

140
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,919
You love me, don't you?

141
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
You'll help me.

142
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,240
You will help me.

143
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,320
Here's the plan.

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,240
Go to Lu Haoran.

145
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,919
He likes you, doesn't he?

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Use every means

147
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,759
to get him to hand over the map.

148
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,919
Okay?

149
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,519
You want me to be with him?

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,039
Haoran.

151
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,519
Just help me.

152
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,679
Otherwise, he'll kill me.

153
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,879
As long as you hand over the map...

154
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,159
Fine.

155
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,840
I see now. You're truly married.

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,679
I understand

157
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,519
who's in your heart.

158
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,120
To please him, you've sold me out.

159
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,960
Haoran.

160
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,440
You promised

161
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,840
to take good care of me.

162
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,519
Am I worth less than a map?

163
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,200
What did Lu Haoran say?

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,879
He agreed.

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,159
Mange, thank you.

166
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,600
Thank you.

167
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,440
But he's afraid you'll take all the credit.

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,879
So he wants to join us
for the banquet tomorrow

169
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,480
before he hands it over.

170
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,559
Why did he agree?

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,200
What have you done with him?

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,120
What have you done with him?

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,360
He didn't ask for anything.

174
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,559
He didn't ask at all.

175
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,000
Now that you need something from him,

176
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,879
he already feels superior to you.

177
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,440
Right now, he's feeling quite pleased.

178
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,240
I want to make a copy of the map.

179
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,919
However, the true intentions
are revealed.

180
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
We'll face it together.

181
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:41,480
(Qin Residence)

182
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,879
Why hasn't Lu Haoran arrived yet?

183
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,639
Without the map,
how can we meet the Marshal?

184
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,879
Young Madam.

185
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,879
This is from Second Young Master for you.

186
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,940
What trick is he playing now?

187
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,679
Let's go.

188
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,759
Hold on.

189
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,440
Drop your weapons.

190
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,080
What is this?

191
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,320
This is the map the Marshal requested.

192
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,039
It must be reviewed by the Marshal.

193
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,550
Are you sure you want to see it?

194
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,000
Go in.

195
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,000
Mr. Lu. Ms. Lin.

196
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,140
The Marshal has been waiting
at my residence for quite some time.

197
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,879
Today, someone was specifically sent

198
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,000
to welcome you.

199
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,790
Please.

200
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,799
Why is it you?

201
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,919
Let me introduce you.

202
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,799
This is the Marshal's newly appointed
aide-de-camp.

203
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,919
Lu Haoran.

204
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,759
Guanghe.

205
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,639
I didn't have time to inform you.

206
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,850
The Marshal has given me
a military position,

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,840
so I can no longer pull rickshaws.

208
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,759
I hope you understand.
