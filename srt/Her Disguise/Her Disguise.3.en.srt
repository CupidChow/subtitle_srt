Is there anything?

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,719
Yes.

52
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,580
What's the matter, Guanghe?

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Thank you.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,680

60
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,360
What are you doing here?

00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,370

I came to ask Mange for some remedies.

64
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,199
Guanghe, you won't get angry, will you?

65
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,519
Talk about it tomorrow.

71
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,839
If you give me the map,

72
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,480
I promise the Lu family will be fine.

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,680

74
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,079
Is your injury all right?

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,720
Go find the map along the way.

76
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,600
What?

77
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
The map is lost?

78
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,000
I just sounded out Qin.

79
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,639
I think he didn't take the map.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,560
No problem.

81
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
Guanghe, I made this myself.

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,720
Give it a try.

83
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,780
What are you doing?

84
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,199

85
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,639

Sister-in-law is like a mother.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
I was just kidding.

92
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,519
I drank

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,800
too much yesterday.

94
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,390
I suddenly feel a bit sleepy.

95
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,399
I love this.

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,720
Could you please deliver it
to my room later?

97
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,680
If you want to eat, just eat here.

98
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,439
Don't bother your sister-in-law.

99
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,720
You eat first.

100
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,279
Guanghe, don't be angry.

101
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
Don't quarrel because of me.

102
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll bring it to him later.

104
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,390

but still couldn't find it.

105
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:47,920
Okay.

106
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,399
You really came over to feed me.

107
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,839
There's no poison inside, right?

108
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,399
My head has been

109
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
hurting recently.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,519
Could you please help me massage it?

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,200

112

people's fears and doubts

113

115
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,600
a lot of bad things usually, right?

116
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,720
You took

117
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
the map last night, didn't you?

118
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,840
You have been mentioning
the map all the time.

119
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,559
Is this important?

120
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,440

122
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,960
would I still be alive?

123
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,519
Is the girl in the welfare
home your sister?

124
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,720
Her name is Cui.

125
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,480
What have you done to her?

126
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm the one asking questions now.

127
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,919
It has nothing to do with her.

128
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,559

131
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,960
or no?

132
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,480
Hold on.

133
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,360
