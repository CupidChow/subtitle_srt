(Adapted from Shuiyue Xianling's novel, "Her Disguise")

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,860
=Episode 17=

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,519
Mange.

28
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,799
Today I'll take you out for a stroll
to buy some clothes and jewelry.

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,560
Guanghe, it's not necessary.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,920
That won't do.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,239
My bride must be
the most beautiful in town.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,560
Haoran.

33
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,040
Kept you up all night and no rest.

34
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,359
This is too much.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,200
Haoran, let's go.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,799
You'll wear yourself out.

37
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,439
Let's go.

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,719
Come on.

39
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,840
Haoran!

40
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,120
Haoran.

41
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,360
What's wrong?

42
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,840
Haoran, wake up.

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,879
Haoran!

44
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,280
Wake up, Haoran.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,479
Second Young Master had a fever all night.

46
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,840
Haoran said that, as a servant
with a serious illness,

47
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,290
it's not appropriate
to disturb the master.

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,250
So, he went back to the Lu family's
tomb keeper's cabin on the mountain.

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,000
Young Madam.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,719
Guanghe.

51
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,039
You really went too far this time.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,120
Mange.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,639
You're going to see Haoran, aren't you?

54
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,680
It's a rare chance to torment him.

55
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,680
Too bad he escaped.

56
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,479
Lin Mange.

57
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,000
You're too heartless.

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,240
I should have known women are fickle.

59
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,000
Better he left.

60
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,520
We're getting married next month.

61
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,800
What if he infects us
with a serious illness?

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
There's still so much to do.

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,199
I've done everything you asked.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,890
I can't help if there's an issue
with the map.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,290
But what about what you promised me?

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,879
If I can make Eldest Young Master
the head of the family,

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,719
I can certainly

68
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,400
make Ms. Yuning

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,599
the Second Young Madam Lu.

70
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,360
Now that Lu Haoran has fallen,

71
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,919
isn't this the perfect time for you
to keep a love nest?

72
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,360
However, this time

73
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,199
I'll need Ms. Yuning
to help with one more thing.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,199
A doctor told me

75
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,240
that using spirits can help
bring down a fever.

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Come.

77
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Let me help you wipe your chest
and back.

78
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,370
It'll bring down the fever faster.

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,079
Yuning.

80
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,079
I never expected

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,600
we'd end up like this.

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Let me help you wipe your back as well.

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,879
(I'll need Ms. Yuning
to help with one more thing.)

84
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,079
(Check if the map is on Lu Haoran.)

85
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,240
Spirits shouldn't be used
on the chest or back.

86
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,759
It can cause vasoconstriction
and stagnation.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,959
Lin Mange, what are you doing here?

88
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,959
I have a prescription
for reducing fever.

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,390
Could you fill the prescription?

90
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,959
You want me to go?

91
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,399
Otherwise, should you
give the injection?

92
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,680
Mange.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,079
Did Guanghe...

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,839
Did Eldest Young Master know
you came here?

95
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,839
I came to torment you.

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,360
You've deceived and tormented me
time and again.

97
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,290
Now, even the heavens are punishing you.

98
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,600
Your life is in my hands.

99
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,160
I can do as I wish.

100
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,319
(Pigeon blood tattoo.)

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,279
(It only appears when
the blood temperature rises.)

102
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
(The map must not be destroyed.)

103
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,839
(And no one else can know about it.)

104
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,480

No.

142
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,040
Nothing at all.

143
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,940
I searched his clothes
and everywhere on his chest and back,

144
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,800
but found nothing.

145
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,360
Besides,

146
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,960
who would tattoo a map on their body?

147
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,240
You must have read too many
detective novels.

148
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
Then it must be

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,879
with someone else.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,279
Cui has been sent back to Chunyi House.

151
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,159
This time,

152
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,960
their guards are strict.

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
It will be hard

154
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,919
to get her out again.

155
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,759
Cui and Lanlan have been my best friends
since childhood.

156
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,799
Knowing Cui, she would never commit suicide
by running into the wall.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,279
Lu Guanghe used a fake photo
just to deceive me.

158
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,240
They must have set a trap

159
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,159
to stop my investigation.

160
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,879
I need to rescue her quickly

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
and deal with Chunyi House.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,159
Don't you have the photos
from the Qin family?

163
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,840
But these photos can't prove

164
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,679
they're from Qin Wenyuan's secret room.

165
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
There must be someone else
behind Qin Wenyuan.

166
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I want to make them all disappear.

167
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,159
I didn't expect you'd turn into my buyer.

168
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,480
I'll take her.

169
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,960
The girls here are all well-trained.

170
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
They're not meant to be maids.

171
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,080
Since Master Qin recommended it,

172
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,519
there should be no problem.

173
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,759
Which Master Qin are you referring to?

174
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,240
Which Master Qin?

175
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,240
Mr. Qin from the Chamber of Commerce.

176
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,879
