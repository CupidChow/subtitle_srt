You are here

55
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,759
to avenge your best friend, Lanlan.

56
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,520
Lin Mange.

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,319
I'll help you.

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,560
Draw the map for me.

59
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,190
And I'll help you revenge.

60
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,039
Lanlan is dead because of you.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Okay.

62
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
If you really think so,

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,560
you can use all of your needles on me

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
to avenge your best friend.

65
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,560
But

66
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,120
you have to tattoo
the real map onto my back.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,959
If it's fake,

68
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,399
I have many ways

69
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,120
to drag you down with me.

70
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:43,839
Mange.

71
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,079
Mange.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,490
Are you still hesitating?

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
Or do you want me to show my brother,

74
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,879
your fiance,

75
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,759
something thrilling?

76
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,279
Be careful.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,199
What

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,480
are you doing?

79
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,839
A cat ran in just now.

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,839
It's ill.

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,590
So, I asked Mange
to take a look at it.

82
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,959
But everything
is in a mess because of it.

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,639
Guanghe, what's wrong?

84
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,040
Are you feeling unwell?

85
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm fine.

86
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,879
Mange.

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,399
I need to talk to you.

88
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,480
Visit me in my room later.

89
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,519
Guanghe.

90
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,990
It's so late already.
Are you still studying?

91
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,480
Mange.

92
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,759
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,399
What's wrong, Guanghe?

94
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
I want to give you the best life.

95
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,800
But I have a weak body.

96
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,120
I'm the eldest,

97
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,839
but I'm useless.

98
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,959
But the Lu family is
under Lu Haoran's control.

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,319
He hangs out with criminal gangs
and has vicious conduct.

100
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,340
But he's the head of the family.

101
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,079
(Actually,)

102
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,319

to tattoo it to your body?)

106
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,630
(By tattooing it with pigeon blood,)

107
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,199
(you can only see it
when my body heats up.)

108

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040

know about it.)
