She said she liked green.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
That year, for her birthday,

29
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,519
I hired the best tailor in town

30
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,280
to make this ribbon

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560

32
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,400
It looks quite good

33
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,039
on you too.

34
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,080
Mange,

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,039
you said earlier

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,759
that this is your belonging,

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,360
is that right?

38
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,280
Yes.

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,680
From the beginning,

40
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,599
you weren't here for me, were you?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,490
You already knew about my relationship
with Lanlan, didn't you?

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
You all deceived me.

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,800
You didn't fall in love with me.

44
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,879
You're just seeking revenge for her,
aren't you?

45
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,639
Speak up.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Explain yourself.

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,719
Say it!

48
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,439
This ribbon

49
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
was given to me when she left.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
She did me a great favor.

51
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,919
I just wanted to see

52
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,360
if the person she once loved
with her life

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,159
was worth it.

54
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,520
At first, I couldn't understand.

55
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,840
But then I met you, Guanghe,

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
and I suddenly felt

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,159
that some things
weren't as important anymore.

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,720
I don't want to live in hatred anymore.

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,199
I've truly let go.

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,879
Mange.

61
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,800
So everything you did

62
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,199
was to be with me, right?

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Or was it

64
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,399
to have an affair

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
with Lu Haoran?

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
I thought you would love me,

67
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,879
understand me,

68
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,800
and believe in me.

69
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
I imagined we would
have a happy life together.

70
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,800
But instead,
you've always been doubting me.

71
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Mange.

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,639
Have you really let go?

73
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,439
I can release him,

74
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,959
