=Her Disguise=
(Adapted from Shuiyue Xianling's novel, "Her Disguise")

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,140
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,799
Not only did you come to me,

4
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,840
but you also tried to steal my things.

5
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,560
Isn't this too much?

6
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,560
Second Young Master Lu.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,799
Master Qin made you
the leader of the merchant world,

8
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,640
but you kept the military map
he asked you to find.

9
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,000
(Lu Haoran, Second Young Master Lu)
Master Qin is angry.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,359
If you don't hand over the map,

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,439
I will let you

12
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,640
die before a woman.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,799
Is this the gift Master Qin said
he would send me?

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,000
I have no choice
but to return the gift then.

15
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,480
Ms. Lin. This way, please.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,319
Young Master is busy.

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,760
Please sit here and take a break.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,159
Second Young Master likes tranquility
and is sleeping upstairs.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,560
You shouldn't disturb him.

20
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,860
(Lin Mange)

21
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,319
Qin just won't quit.

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
One is not enough. He sent two.

23
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,919
I'll send both of you to your death.

24
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,879
I'm a family doctor.

25
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,879
I do acupuncture.

26
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,159
Acupuncture?

27
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
You do look like it.

28
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,080
Don't move.

29
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,680
You are stronger
than the previous woman.

30
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,919
Unfortunately,

31
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
the end is still the same.

32
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,600
Stop.

33
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,839
Guanghe.

34
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,120
When treating a woman,

35
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,370
you should be gentle,

36
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,439
Haoran.

37
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,480
Guanghe.

38
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,980
(Lu Guanghe, Young Master Lu)

39
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,240
Guanghe,

40
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
you know her?

41
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,279
Who is she?

42
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,720
My personal doctor,

43
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,439
Lin Mange.

44
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,160
There's a problem with this woman.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,120
I'll find you another one.

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,759
Besides,

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,000
she is my fiancee.

48
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,439
From today onward,
call her sister-in-law.

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
Sister-in-law?

50
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,839
Guanghe, you just called me your...

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Mange, I didn't do that out of anxiety.

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
I called you here

53
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,850
not only to ask you to become my doctor.

54
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,380
Promise me. Consider the possibility
between us, all right?

55
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,120
All right.

56
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,170
Your leg is healing faster
than expected.

57
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,620
You won't be needing a cane soon.

58
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,600
Mange,

59
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,120
Haoran has been managing
the family business.

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,580
He is used to being willful.

61
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,639
Don't take things to heart.

62
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
Later,

63
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
send Qin's gift back to him.

64
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,590
Don't let anyone find out.

65
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,480
No problem.

66
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,990
Second Young Master,

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,759
Qin is really evil.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
We should be more careful.

69
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,880
Also,

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,079
we don't know

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,319
who that woman was.

72
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,879
Who is she?

73
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,720
Investigate her.

74
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,120
Second Young Master.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
Can we talk about this?

76
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,199
Give me some help.

77
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,519
Help me out.

78
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,720
Fine. This counts.

79
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,160
(Yuning, Lu Family's Cousin)
Ms. Yuning, you're back.

80
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,519
(Yuning, Lu Family's Cousin)

81
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,000
For you.

82
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,879
Thank you.

83
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,040
Haoran?

84
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,240
Why are you here?

85
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,560
I...

86
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,959
What is this?

87
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
This is...

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,879
This is...

89
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,990
That is my baggage that just arrived.

90
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,439
Send it to my room.

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,480
No problem.

92
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,199
Who are you?

93
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,279
I am...

94
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,170
Thank you, Second Young Master.

95
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,879
What? Did I hurt you?

96
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,480
Who are you? You are so clumsy.

97
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,879
I'm sure it hurts a lot.

98
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:43,800
It's fine.

99
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
You need to disinfect your wound.

100
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,490
I have medicine in my room.
Let me bring it for you.

101
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,160
I have antiseptic here.

102
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,190
Can you give me your hand,
Second Young Master?

103
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,639
You can trick my brother with your act,

104
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,519
but it's still lacking here.

105
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,600
Sister-in-law.

106
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,580
Forget it if you don't need it.

107
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,519
I won't leak your matters

108
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
to anyone, Second Young Master.

109
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,039
I just want to stay in the Lu family

110
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,720
to fulfill my wish.

111
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,120
Wait.

112
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,120
You did so much
just to enter the Lu family.

113
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm sure you are here for me.

114
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,240
This orchid is well-drawn.

115
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
Second Young Master drew it with a servant.

116
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
Unfortunately, the servant
had impure intentions

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
and was already gone.

118
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,480
You entered with a weapon.

119
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
You called yourself a doctor?

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,519
I do acupuncture.

121
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,679
I just treated your dislocated shoulder.

122
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,220
Second Young Master,
don't be angry for no reason

123
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,530
and don't be so bloodthirsty.

124
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,080
Stop.

125
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,320
I accidentally disturbed Second Young Master.

126
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
Lin Mange is my fiancee.

127
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,759
From today onward,

128
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
call her sister-in-law.

129
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,600
You will be the madam
of the Lu family in the future.

130
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,200
This is your room.

131
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,039
(Lanlan.)

132
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,879
(I'm here, Lanlan.)

133
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
(I will avenge you.)

134
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,000
(I'm sure you enter the Lu family)

135
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,720
(for me.)

136
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,600
(I am here for you,)

137
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,879
