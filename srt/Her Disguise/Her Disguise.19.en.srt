27
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,520
Congratulations.

28
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,560
Congratulations!

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Thank you.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,079
Thank you.

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,439
Thank you, everyone.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,480
Thank you.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,120
Eldest Young Master Lu.

34
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,920
I've invested in the textile factory.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,319
Next month will be your wedding.

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,760
The Lu family is truly blessed with
double happiness.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Come, let's celebrate.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Mr. Chen.

39
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,239
(I plan to use the identity of
Lu Guanghe's fiancée)

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,879
(to meet Qin Wenyuan.)

41
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,660
(The banquet is held at the Heping Hotel.)

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,439
(Qin Wenyuan will not be home.)

43
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,290
(I'll do my best to keep him occupied.)

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,039
(I'll sneak into
the Qin family's secret room)

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,159
(and search for valuable evidence.)

46
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,120
(Be careful.)

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,240
(Whether you find evidence or not,)

48
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,280
(don't stay too long.)

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,080
(Don't worry.)

50
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,280
Cheers.

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,319
No findings?

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't want to force her.

53
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,639
What about Lu Haoran?

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,759
Even at this point,

55
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,479
he still won't speak.

56
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,840
A bit of discipline might be enough.

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,960
There's no need to push him
to the brink of death.

58
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,240
Mr. Qin.

59
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,800
Guanghe.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
You sound like
I'm making you do something bad.

61
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,960
The marshal has gone to find
that batch of arms.

62
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,039
There's only one last corner missing.

63
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,400
The marshal will be back next month.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Even if I don't ask you,

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,199
he will question you personally.

66
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:06,960
Master Qin.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,530
Ladies and gentlemen.

68
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,279
Today is Eldest Young Master Lu's joyous day.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,879
I have prepared a special gift.

70
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,000
Come.

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,199
This...

72
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,720
Isn't this Second Young Master Lu?

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,040
Get up.

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,490
Eldest Young Master Lu.

75
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,560
He has been expelled from the Lu family.

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,079
I hand him over to the police.

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,470
You have no objections, right?

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,120
It's my fault.

79
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,319
It's my fault.

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,879
I've been lax in my supervision.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,959
What about Ms. Lin?

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,319
Mr. Qin.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,759
How about we pay to redeem him?

84
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,279
I'm not short of money.

85
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,360
Besides,

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,199
how can I let Ms. Lin pay?

87
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,839
If we don't talk about money,

88
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,020
then you must want something else.

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
Should I say it out loud?

90
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
If you really dare to say it,

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
he won't dare to listen.

92
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Who made a police report?

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,240
It's me.

94
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,620
Who contacted the reporter?

95
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,199
It's me.

96
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,120
I did.

97
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,418
(Secrets of a Socialite's Home
Chunyi House Boss Revealed)

98
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,760
The era of Qin Wenyuan as
the Chamber of Commerce president

99
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,399
is finally over.

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,199
I don't care about Qin Wenyuan.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,000
But Haoran is still in
the police station.

102
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,759
We need to find a way to get him out.

103
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,680
Guanghe.

104
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,920
We're getting married next month.

105
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,319
The reporters are waiting
to write their stories.

106
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,120
Is that what you want too?

107
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,560
I'd be glad if he suffered even more.

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,759
But we must also consider
the Lu family's reputation.

109
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
We can't drive it into a corner.

110
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:41,920
Guanghe.

111
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,590
You're now in the best position

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,090
to become
the Chamber of Commerce president.

113
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Should we get the reporter's support
for the public opinion?

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,240
Successful individuals like yourself

115
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,150
must be respectful to parents
and supportive of siblings.

116
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,190
I've heard Master Lu
is like this at home,

117
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,639
always valued by your parents

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,860
and a good elder brother
to your younger sibling.

119
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,120
You flatter me.

120
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,079
But I've heard that your younger brother
is currently detained,

121
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,160
which has affected your reputation.

122
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,319
Without this issue,

123
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,390
you would be a top figure
in the business world.

124
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,720
With your influence in the industry,

125
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,480
the Chamber of Commerce presidency
should be yours.

126
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,560
Mr. Yang, let me see you off.

127
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,120
Okay.

128
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,960
Thanks for coming.

129
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
All right.

130
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,960
I'll leave it to you.

131
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,159
Thank you.

132
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,440
Please, stay.

133
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,360
Rickshaw!

134
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,360
Clean it up.

135
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,639
Okay, master.

136
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,919
What is this?

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,679
This?

138
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,039
Since the young madam's room
is being redecorated,

139
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,039
these are clothes ready for washing.

140
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,919
Guanghe.

141
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,679
Guanghe.

142
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,879
Guanghe, did you call me?

143
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
Are you feeling unwell?

144
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,759
Does this belong to you?

145
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,399
