I have

43
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,680
a bit of a temper,

44
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,620
but now that you're married
into the family, you're one of us.

45
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,290
Please overlook the things

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,039
that happened before.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,520
Today we just happened
to run into each other.

48
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,840
How about I treat you to something nice

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,560

50
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,840
Let's go.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,960

54
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,400
No matter what,

55
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,000
it was my fault.

56
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,439
Today,

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,439
consider it my apology.

58
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,120
Actually, it's not entirely your fault.

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
I heard

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
that a maid from the Lu family
has offended you.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,090
It could be a misunderstanding.

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,680
That wasn't a misunderstanding.

63
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,840
The maid had ill intentions.

64
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,919
But why did she end up
committing suicide?

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,599
That woman

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,840
wanted to climb the social ladder,

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,159
but didn't succeed.

68
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,639
The Lu family didn't want her,

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
and she had a falling out
with Guanghe.

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,990
She ended up taking her own life.

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
So, she wasn't involved with
Second Young Master.

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
You sent that girl to Chunyi House

73
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,519
in front of Ms. Lin.

74
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,879
What a clever tactic of sowing discord.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,040
So, when will

76
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,519
your grand show start?

77
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,120
Eldest Young Master Lu, don't rush.

78
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,399
I didn't expect Second Young Master Lu
to be such a romantic.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,079
He'd rather give the map to a girl

80
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,720
than to you.

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,639
It depends on Ms. Lin's choice now.

82
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,519
Marshal Lian will remember

83
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,759
this achievement.

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
It's time for the Lu family
to have a new master.

85
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,959
Don't move.

86
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,199
Wait until your family delivers the map,
then I'll let you go.

87
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,319
Have you called Second Young Master Lu?

88
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,439
I've called him.

89
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,319
He agreed to come.

90
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,560

91

92
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,000
kill both of them.

93
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,519
What's the matter?

94
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,720

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,879
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

96
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,600
