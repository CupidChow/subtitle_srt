=Episode 2=

27
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,200
Wait.

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,200
You did so much
just to enter the Lu family.

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,519
I'm sure you are here for me.

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,970
Second Young Master,
you're overthinking.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Who are you?

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,640
I am the Eldest Young Master's Fiancee.

33
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,079
Guanghe?

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,479
Why are you getting entangled
with Haoran then?

35
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,039
You made a mistake.

36
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,280
He was the one
who was getting entangled with me.

37
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,360
You...

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,919
Guanghe.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,919
Did you bring that woman here?

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,690
She even said she was your fiancee.

41
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,879
But she is seducing Haoran.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Don't overthink.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,439
Mange is a doctor.

44
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,280
She should help Haoran.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,400
Besides,

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
I also know what you are thinking of.

47
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,280
Naturally, I hope

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
you can become the Second Young Madam.

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
What if she has an ulterior motive?

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,759
What? Did I hurt you?

51
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,039
Don't forget

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,439
how the family was in chaos

53
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,000
because of that woman.

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,990
You've worked hard, Mange.

55
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,790
You should
let the servants do these things.

56
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,919
It's also my honor

57
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,120
to serve the whole family.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,290
I've been starving the whole day.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,879
Are we just having snacks?

60
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,280
Guanghe,

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,159
these are not filling.

62
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,639
Why are you so squeamish?

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,560
Mange, who is serving us,
hasn't even said a word.

64
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,120
Mange,

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,360
you must be tired.

66
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,639
You're too polite, Yuning.

67
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,439
Second Young Master, eat while it's hot.

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,800
You are the Eldest Young Madam,

69
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,590
yet you are serving soup
to your fiance's brother.

70
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,660
Those who know about it think
you care about Haoran,

71
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,660
but those who don't might think
that there's something between you two.

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Yuning.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,159
Since Mange
is showing her kindness,

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,760
I must try it.

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,879
Guanghe, here you go.

76
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,560
Haoran.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,279
It hurts.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,560
Lin Mange,

79
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,570
what did you put in the soup?

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,839
Haoran,

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,800
the woman boiled this soup.

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
I'm sure she poisoned the soup

83
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,240
and wanted to poison us.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,439
Guanghe, I didn't.

85
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,879
Lin Mange,

86
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,160
even if you don't like me,

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,920
you shouldn't kill me.

88
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,680
Haoran!

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,390
All of you should go out.

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,590
I'll take responsibility for treating.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,319
Can you do it?

92
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,160
Yuning,

93
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,600
Mange is a doctor.

94
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,090
But Haoran is...

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,600
Enough.

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,279
Let's go.

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,370
You'll be the Lu family's Young Madam
from now on.

98
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,399
Let us do everything.

99
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,780
There's no need for you to worry.

100
00:04:59,399 --> 00:04:59,839
Oh,

101
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,120
in terms of diet,

102
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,690
Eldest Young Master doesn't like meat.

103
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,390
Second Young Master
is allergic to mushrooms.

104
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,480
He can't even eat any.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,639
Do you know

106
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,480
what a young madam should do?

107
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
The food I'm making

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,439
is already in the kitchen.

109
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,600
Please wait. It'll be done soon.

110
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,480
(I must first find evidence
of killing Lanlan.)

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,600
Don't move.

112
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,279
Do you think you can knock me out

113
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,920
with your petty trick?

114
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,720
Tell me.

115
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,399
How much did Qin pay you

116
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
to find this map?

117
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,519
If you tell me,

118
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,639
I'll spare you.

119
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't know.

120
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,800
Guanghe was right.

121
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Don't move.

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,279
I should

123
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,279
treat a girl gently.

124
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,190
What are you trying to do?

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
Help!

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
- Help!
- Let me go.

127
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Help!

128
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,319
Mange.

129
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:54,959
Help!

130
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,920
Guanghe.

131
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,839
Guanghe.

132
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,360
Guanghe.

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,439
Haoran!

134
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,240
Look.

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,639
Look!

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
Your woman molested me

137
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,480
when I was passed out.

138
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Lin Mange, you are so lewd!

139
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,079
Mange.

140
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,920
I...

141
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,240
I am your brother-in-law.

142
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
That's enough.

143
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,399
Mange, are you all right?

144
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,290
I think Second Young Master
is allergic to mushrooms

145
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,279
and is hallucinating.

146
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,690
The Shangwan Pressure Point
helps calm a person down.

147
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,039
Are you sober now?

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,799
You are right.

149
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,879
I did come here for you.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,440
Guanghe,

151
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,840
do you believe me?

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,879
Of course.

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,399
Haoran has always been mischievous.

154
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Yuning isn't a scheming person.

155
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,440
She was just joking.

156
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,320
Mange,

157
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,799
I promise you.

158
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,090
Something like this won't happen again.

159
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,559
Second Young Master,
I have three things to tell you.

160
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,240
The first thing is...

161
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
Tell me the second thing.

162
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,480
The second thing is that the woman

163
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,240
grew up in an orphanage.

164
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,639
Later, she helped out at a clinic.

165
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
A few months ago,
she knew Young Master at the clinic.

166
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,519
I don't think
she is related to Qin Wenyuan.

167
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,679
However,

168
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,039
the orphanage
belongs to Qin Wenyuan's faction.

169
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,960
The first thing is...

170
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,320
Tell me the third thing.

171
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,480
The third thing

172
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,279
is Qin Wenyuan might be the president
of the Chamber of Commerce,

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,679
but he is
just a subordinate of Marshal Lian.

174
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,480
Lian has been looking for the map
for a long time.

175
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,150
This is an opportunity
to offer the map,

176
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,200
so he won't let the chance go.

177
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,879
Interesting.

178
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,159
I'm going out.

179
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,340
Second Young Master,

180
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,799
don't go to the orphanage.

181
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,590
Qin Wenyuan's men
are keeping an eye on you.

182
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,100
(Jiahe Studio)

183
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,200
Ms. Mange.

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,200
You are so punctual.

185
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,679
Don't disturb them.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,180
I'm sure they are already sleeping.

187
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,279
Cui,

188
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,720
I was late over the last two days,

189
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,990
but your illness and Ping's illness
cannot wait any longer.

190
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Take this money.

191
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,399
It can help out the sisters as well.

192
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
This is too much, Ms. Mange.

193
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
I don't need so much.

194
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,360
Just take it.

195
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,360
I didn't see you
when I went to the clinic two days ago.

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,799
Are you all right?

197
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,120
Don't worry. I'm fine.

198
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,679
I just want

199
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,759
to help Lanlan do something.

200
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,679
It's late. All of you should rest.

201
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm leaving.

202
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,360
Take care of yourself.

203
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:11,420
(Aici Orphanage)

204
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,460
(Jiahe Studio)

205
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,120
After him!

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,519
Stop!

207
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,519
This way!

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,960
Hurry!

209
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,559
Don't run!

210
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,440
Stop!

211
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,720
Stop!

212
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,360
Second Young Master?

213
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,300
Second Young Master.

214
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,780
