1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,009
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,009
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,679
Lee Se Na is Dr. Choi's secret mistress.

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,750
Honestly, my husband who cheated on me...

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,320
might have committed suicide with that woman.

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,119
How can you expect me to be sad and pity him?

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,919
Se Na.

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,760
I think I can become really happy now.

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,420
It was all an act?

11
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,829
We were caught.

12
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,459
So, you should go back now.

13
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,859
How much longer could we keep running away?

14
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:27,300
My life, yours,

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,469
and even our marriage...

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,300
were all planned by Mother.

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,810
We're not the family you think we are.

18
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,608
I'm so proud.

19
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,240
I didn't think he'd actually pull it off.

20
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,709
Lee Se Na was spying on this house through this camera.

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,379
That means there's someone in this house who's helping her out.

22
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,850
Jae Jin said he couldn't live without Ji Eun.

23
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,659
Do you know...

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,020
everything about Do Hyun?

25
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,530
Do Hyun's child.

26
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,298
But when did this kid...

27
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,130
Don't you think he needs his dad in this situation?

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,869
You'll be on my side, won't you, Dad?

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,439
I will support your decision.

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,769
Thank you, Mom.

31
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,238
This happened 14 years ago.

32
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,809
There was a fire that killed a whole family.

33
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,640
The daughter who died in the fire was the eldest daughter.

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,078
Then I heard there was a survivor.

35
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,209
You're right.

36
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,218
The name is Lee Se Na.

37
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,349
Why is it that all of your family members end up dying like that?

38
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,920
The game will now start to get fun.

39
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,790
Lee Se Na wasn't the only survivor.

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,359
Her older sister was alive.

41
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,670
Sister Maria, someone came to see you.

42
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,989
Ms. Lee Se Eun?

43
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,890
Se Eun died.

44
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,800
In the beginning, it was a pigeon.

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,379
Se Na.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,050
Se Eun, aren't the pigeons cute?

47
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,250
Yes.

48
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,460
I'll go inside first.

49
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,759
Okay.

50
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,069
Se Na.

51
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,020
There was only one reason my sister gave.

52
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,930
That she killed them because her sister didn't like them.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,959
The stronger her obsession for Se Eun grew,

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,930
the scarier she began to act.

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,699
And that day, the fire broke out.

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,539
Se Eun, wake up.

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,870
Why?

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
What is it?

59
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,379
Mom!

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,680
It's all over, Se Eun.

61
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,319
Did you perhaps...

62
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,990
If it weren't for Mom and Dad,

63
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,189
you would've liked me too.

64
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,759
Let go.

65
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,360
Let go!

66
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,530
Let go!

67
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,159
Mom.

68
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,330
Mom!

69
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,750
That's as far as Se Eun remembers.

70
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,448
Then, when everyone thought she was dead,

71
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,689
Se Eun miraculously woke up.

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,930
And then? She never told her sister?

73
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,289
Right.

74
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,829
Like that, she hid here like a dead person.

75
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,100
When did...

76
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,040
Se Eun...

77
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,079
She had severe PTSD.

78
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,410
She even developed complications...

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,350
and didn't live for more than a few years.

80
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,790
(Personal Record)

81
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,060
(Personal Record)

82
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,769
(Original photo, Detected photo)

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,319
It looks really similar, doesn't it?

84
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,888
But that night,

85
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,399
("No Yeong Won's Everlasting Solution")

86
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,459
a fire started.

87
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,870
Good job.

88
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,639
- Thank you. - Thank you.

89
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,870
Thank you!

90
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,740
Lee Se Na will be so surprised.

91
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,449
But will she really come here?

92
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,449
Her sister is Lee Se Na's only weakness.

93
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,050
I'm sure she'll show up.

94
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,560
She's here.

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,560
- That's her, right? - Yes.

96
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,939
("No Yeong Won's Everlasting Solution")

97
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,819
(Chapter 9: Witch Hunt)

98
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:23,990
It's all a lie.

99
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,420
Your sister is dead.

100
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,829
- Oh, gosh. Go. - Oh, my!

101
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Yeong Won!

102
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,509
- Are you okay? - Yeong Won!

103
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,639
Did you record all of that?

104
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,350
Yes, we recorded it.

105
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,850
Yes, we even recorded her strangling you.

106
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,189
Are you okay?

107
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,860
- Get Lee Se Na first. - Yes, ma'am.

108
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,930
Are you okay? Over here!

109
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,768
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

110
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,800
Darn it.

111
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,689
Gosh.

112
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,370
Sorry, coming through.

113
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,180
What? Darn it.

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,170
Darn it.

115
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,509
Let go of me!

116
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,620
Let go!

117
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,279
The person who sent a threatening package to Ms. No Yeong Won...

118
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,379
That was you, right?

119
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,750
Do you...

120
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,990
have proof?

121
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,659
We have video of all of it.

122
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,000
A scene of you threatening Ms. No Yeong Won.

123
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,100
We can tell how you feel about Ms. No just by watching this.

124
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:27,909
Mr. Policeman.

125
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,940
Do you know about my relationship with No Yeong Won's husband?

126
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,379
I see.

127
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,419
You do know.

128
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,789
Gosh, what?

129
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,789
Are you saying that was why you did this?

130
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,289
Think about it.

131
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,860
How badly would No Yeong Won despise me?

132
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,029
So, she wanted to tease me.

133
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,700
That was why she said my sister was alive.

134
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,340
She knows...

135
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,940
how much I miss my sister.

136
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,940
But she said she was dead.

137
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,549
She said it was a lie that my sister was alive.

138
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,379
So, earlier...

139
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,350
I became angry without realizing it.

140
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,100
Then, why did you install hidden cameras in Ms. No's house?

141
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,200
That's an obvious act of stalking and a crime!

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,870
Do you have proof?

143
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,169
Why is everyone only believing No Yeong Won's words?

144
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,480
A police officer shouldn't only believe a powerful person's words.

145
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,179
I'm not that kind of police officer.

146
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,360
Then, what about the fire that broke out at your house?

147
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,559
The fact that you get so shaken up by it...

148
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,330
It's very suspicious.

149
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,440
You know that, right?

150
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,740
That fire...

151
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,779
killed my whole family.

152
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,220
Do you know how painful it is...

153
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,850
to be the only survivor?

154
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,320
It's suspicious?

155
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,360
Why?

156
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,559
Because I survived alone?

157
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,100
If you're suspecting that I killed them,

158
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,899
go ahead and investigate me.

159
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,340
I do want...

160
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,779
to prove my innocence.

161
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,289
She's not an easy one to deal with.

162
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,389
I didn't expect her to admit it easily.

163
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,960
With the recorded video,

164
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,668
I can request a warrant.

165
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:10,840
But there isn't enough evidence to prove her blackmail.

166
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,398
I'm worried it might be dismissed.

167
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,370
I'll try my best to secure evidence within 48 hours.

168
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,879
May I speak to her?

169
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,120
How dare you use my sister...

170
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,558
to get me?

171
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,830
I thought you'd show up out of fear.

172
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,628
What am I afraid of?

173
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,799
You must've thought...

174
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,340
that your sister died of the fire.

175
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,110
But she was alive.

176
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,409
You did it out of affection for your sister,

177
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,210
but your family despised you.

178
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,320
You must've felt so heartbroken.

179
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,759
Right. I'll try to understand the resentment and rage...

180
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,889
you felt toward your family.

181
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,459
Why do you want my family to be ruined?

182
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,029
It's not that I want your family to be ruined.

183
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,840
I let you know that it had already been ruined.

184
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,370
I was simply curious...

185
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,908
to know if you could talk so easily...

186
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:28,378
about other families even after facing the dirty truth...

187
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,909
about your own family.

188
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,820
At a time like that,

189
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,720
normal people raise an issue and have a discussion...

190
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,559
instead of pulling such a trick.

191
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,889
Are you normal?

192
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,429
You told others not to hide their family problems.

193
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,440
But you tried to bury your own family problems.

194
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,909
You said at a time like that,

195
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,909
one should cut it off.

196
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,279
You were that proud.

197
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,389
It means the world may know about all your problems.

198
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,559
Before you let the world know,

199
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,899
I'll have you isolated and treated.

200
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,399
You have an antisocial personality disorder.

201
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,619
Did you meet Gu Kyung Tae who became a police officer...

202
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,759
after 15 years of studying?

203
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,860
Yes. Thanks to him,

204
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,529
I got to access the footage of the CCTV camera by your house.

205
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,929
You said it was seven days ago, right?

206
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,700
Ms. No received that book in the afternoon seven days ago.

207
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,110
That means it was already in the mailbox.

208
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:07,279
No one put anything in the mailbox.

209
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,549
I checked the footage from the day before...

210
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,049
and the day before that.

211
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,149
But there was no one.

212
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,350
That's strange.

213
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,360
She did say it was found in the mailbox.

214
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,590
Then, did anyone take something out of the mailbox?

215
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,059
I found that strange.

216
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:28,029
No one put anything in the mailbox,

217
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
and no one took anything out of the mailbox.

218
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,139
No one took anything out.

219
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,639
Then, why did Mr. An lied that he took it from the mailbox?

220
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,090
(Mr. An Yo Sub)

221
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,159
We'll have to get as much evidence as possible within 48 hours...

222
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,500
and request it.

223
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,370
The fake pigeon.

224
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,570
The miniature vacation home. And the miniature car.

225
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,840
I packed everything that was delivered.

226
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,740
Just why is Lee Se Na doing this?

227
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,980
She probably took one of my comments...

228
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,219
as criticism against her family.

229
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,350
She ruined her own family. Is she blaming you for it?

230
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,289
She wants to be loved, but if they try to leave her,

231
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,129
she gets rid of them first before they do.

232
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,960
She's frightening.

233
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,700
Could there be any other evidence?

234
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,600
It'd be nice if anyone could testify against her.

235
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,439
Everyone around her is dead.

236
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,309
There are no witnesses.

237
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,350
Lee Se Na is in the police station.

238
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,450
I need your help to get her punished.

239
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,690
What is there that I can do?

240
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:02,359
Lee Se Na attacked you at the vacation home.

241
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,590
I want you to testify about that.

242
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,058
For my family to be free from her,

243
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,730
- I need a lot of evidence... - Wait.

244
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,839
Ms. No.

245
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,339
Just why must I do that?

246
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,480
What do you mean?

247
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,449
She assaulted you. You're a victim.

248
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,920
That's not the point.

249
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,049
You're trying to use me to solve your family issue.

250
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,219
Must I do anything for your family?

251
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,119
You've only taken from me all along.

252
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:46,740
I understand how you feel...

253
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,039
about my family.

254
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,779
But...

255
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,680
we really need your testimony right now.

256
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,980
Leave your family.

257
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,049
Then, I'll testify.

258
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,890
You can't do that, can you?

259
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,899
(Oh Ji Eun, Moon Tae Oh)

260
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,939
(Sun Young, Mr. An Yo Sub)

261
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,710
Tell him this.

262
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,250
All right.

263
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,588
Ma'am, I've brought what you asked for.

264
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,819
Thank you. You can put it there.

265
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,859
Mr. An. Say hello.

266
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,099
This is Mr. Park. He used to be my father's secretary.

267
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,869
Hello. It's nice to meet you. My name is Park Kang Sung.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
Hello. I'm An Yo Sub.

269
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,068
When did you start to work for my family?

270
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,568
It was 15 years ago.

271
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,579
Gosh, 15 years?

272
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,109
You must be like family.

273
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,380
You worked for my family for about 30 years, didn't you?

274
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,189
It was 29 years and 5 months to be exact.

275
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,449
I couldn't meet the 30th year.

276
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,588
I heard he retired,

277
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,329
and we recently met by chance.

278
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,960
Thank you so much for inviting me.

279
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,769
I'll be going out, then.

280
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,440
Mr. An. Have a seat for a bit.

281
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,039
- Sit down. - Sure.

282
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,240
Make yourself comfortable.

283
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,880
Why don't you have a glass?

284
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,220
Seeing you reminds me of my younger days.

285
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,049
Cheers.

286
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,960
You happen to know a lot of secrets and circumstances in the family.

287
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,869
So people like us...

288
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,068
should be close-mouthed.

289
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,170
Don't you agree?

290
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,339
- Yes. - Mr. An.

291
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,379
I want to take something out of my car.

292
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,348
Can I have the remote control for the garage?

293
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,749
I can't find my key.

294
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,548
- I'll go. - No.

295
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,549
Just hand me the remote control. I'll go get it.

296
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,750
You can keep drinking.

297
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,859
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and hand it to her.

298
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,500
Here. Let me pour you some.

299
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,769
You hardly come across a day like today. Hold your glass already.

300
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,329
I really wanted you to see this.

301
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,650
And Ms. No, I checked the footage of the CCTV camera by our house.

302
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,549
The day you said you received the book,

303
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,289
Mr. An didn't take...

304
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,319
anything from the mailbox.

305
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,890
Nothing was even delivered.

306
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,288
So this candid camera...

307
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,359
was definitely done by Mr. An.

308
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,069
How can he be so ungrateful?

309
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,099
Is this how he returns everything we've done for him?

310
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:17,069
I barely stopped myself from sending him to prison.

311
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,150
The thing is, whether he will testify for us.

312
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,779
He's brainwashed.

313
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,920
He won't give in easily.

314
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:28,990
We'll have to make him.

315
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,059
We need solid proof by tomorrow.

316
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,859
Now that you saw, perhaps you realized it.

317
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,869
Go testify to the police tomorrow.

318
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,069
Dr. Choi.

319
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,779
It's time for you to come back to where you belong.

320
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,779
Madam Hong, I didn't get the car key yesterday.

321
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,710
- You mean this? - Yes.

322
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,349
Have a seat.

323
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,559
You've been working with us for 15 years.

324
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,798
After 15 years,

325
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,069
we pretty much know everything about each other, right?

326
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,039
Yes.

327
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,410
Then can you do me a favor?

328
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,180
Yes, what kind of favor?

329
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,720
You can't get a hold of Lee Se Na, can you?

330
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,059
She's in the police station right now.

331
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,930
And...

332
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,630
I know about the relationship between you and her.

333
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,500
We treated you like family and trusted you.

334
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,470
Why did you do that to us?

335
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,750
You have no idea...

336
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,049
how much you've hurt...

Mr. An.

340
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,430
She brainwashed you.

341
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,730
That's impossible.

342
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,069

all you have to do is testify to the truth.

really the best for Se Na?

Hello. How are you?

There's someone I'd like to meet before that.

371
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,779
How outrageous of you.

372
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,079
Did you want to backstab me that badly when I trusted you?

373
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,289
Did you trust me?

374
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,389
Why did you accept my money...

375
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,690
when you weren't going to break up with Jae Jin?

376

Don't you know how a deal works?

377
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,470
I told you...

378
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,069
a mother's love is very beautiful yet sad.

379
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,210
I wanted to tell you...

380
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,779
that a mother's love is useless.

381
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:29,390
You've really lost it.

382
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,390
What about your family?

383
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,660
Is anyone in your family still sane?

384
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,758
Since you've been after my family,

385
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,970
you must know about me very well.

386

Do you think I have a sound mind?

387

Speaking of which,

388
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,538
I should deal...

389
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,509
with someone crazy like you.

390
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,680
Do you even know An Yo Sub got busted?

391
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,259
Everything will be revealed soon.

392
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,529
Let's see how long you can act shameless.

393
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,579
Jae Jin will be here soon to testify.

394
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,180
You see, Oh Ji Eun is the victim.

395
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,779
Perhaps she could help us?

396
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,250
Dr. Oh refused to testify.

397
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,519
Why on earth did she...

398
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,289
Everyone's taking turns to drive me crazy.

399
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,359
It doesn't matter.

400
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:49,269
As long as Mr. An testifies to the truth.

401
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:51,869
But...

402
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,869
we don't have much time left.

403
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,619
All right.

We were going out.

406
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,160
Did you...

407
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,130
set up a candid camera in No Yeong Won's house?

408
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,839
- Yes. - Was it...

409
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,069
Lee Se Na who ordered you to do that?

410

Mr. An Yo Sub?

411
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,529
You'll be in trouble if you give false testimony.

412
00:29:57,869 --> 00:29:59,470
Someone told you...

413
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,609
to install a candid camera...

414
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,640
in No Yeong Won's house, no? Who was it?

415
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,869
It was me.

416
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,509
It was all me.

417
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,140
Se Na doesn't know anything about it.

423
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,549
What happens now?

424
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,750
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,650
We can't...

426
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:56,220
detain Lee Se Na anymore.

427
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,029
I'm at your clinic. Can you come right now?

428

You're here to lock me up, aren't you?

Too bad. You're late.

Lee Se Na.

435
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:52,839
Were you...

436
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,079
Were you really trying to take advantage of me?

437
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,210
Was everything a lie until now?

438
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,650
Is that important?

439
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,789
What's important is that I helped you realize what kind of life...

440
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,490
you wanted.

441
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:11,559
How funny.

442
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,959
You came to have me put away,

443
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,400
but you were still curious about how I really felt?

444
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:21,839
Whatever happened between us until now...

445
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,339
That doesn't matter anymore. But...

446
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,910
I can't let you threaten my family.

447
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,419
It's also a lie that Ji Eun attacked you first at the vacation home,

448
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,680
isn't it?

449
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,549
I'm going to make the statement that you assaulted Ji Eun.

450
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,259
Oh Ji Eun?

451
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,789
But you were the one who did that.

452

Don't you remember?

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,299
I see.

454

Your memory must've been skewed...

455
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,529
because you got excited from seeing blood.

- Hello. - Hey, you guys.

462
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,369
What brings you here all of a sudden?

463
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,769
Mom, you did give your permission last time, right?

00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,110
- She keeps refusing to believe me. - Yes.

I've decided to support your opinion.

But why?

467
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,050
See? I was right, wasn't I?

468
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,719
Then, when should we go study abroad?

469

But I'm hoping you'll have the baby here.

470

Two minors going to study abroad on your own...

471
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,960
to have and raise a baby...

472
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,529
It's not an easy thing to do.

473
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,268
But you said you supported us. You can't do that.

474
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,399
Right.

475
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,368
We decided to have the baby while studying abroad.

476
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,539
What's important is...

477
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,039
having a healthy baby, isn't it?

478
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,179
You can think about studying abroad after that.

479
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,610
Is studying abroad more important than having the baby?

481
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,820
So, did you sort things out?

482
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,159
Gosh, Do Hyun was here too.

483
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,900
Good to see you.

484
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,969
Is this your girlfriend?

485
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,940
Hey, punk. Even your uncle doesn't have a girlfriend.

486
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,808
Uncle, will you give us the room?

487
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:39,880
What?

00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,840
Okay.

489
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,920
But still... I just got here, you punk.

490
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,389
What's this? What's with the atmosphere?

491
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,090
Did you get into some sort of trouble?

492
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,559
Just go.

493
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,929
Our opinion hasn't changed.

494
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,329
Please reconsider.

495
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,670
Let's go, Do Hyun.

496
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,670
Okay.

497
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,909
What?

498
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,650
What's this?

499
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,079
My gosh.

500
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,649
Still, that girl has some spunk.

501
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,089
Do Hyun is helpless in front of her.

502
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,619
But are all kids like that these days?

503
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,130
What? Is there something else?

504
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,730
She's pregnant with Do Hyun's child.

505
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,139
What?

506
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:46,038
Gosh, that punk.

507
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,110
Since when has he kept such a secret...

508
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,579
Hang on.

509
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,250
Then, did they get pregnant because Lee Se Na said so too?

510
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,219
No, that would be a bit weird.

511
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,420
You can't plan a pregnancy beforehand.

512
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,960
My gosh.

513
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,900
(Lee Se Na)

514
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:10,769
You were rash.

515
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,340
Is your son's secret really about the pregnancy?

516
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,010
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

517
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,238
You couldn't help it when she came at you...

518
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,980
determined to defraud you.

519
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,380
This is all Lee Se Na's plan.

520
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,090
It's Lee Se Na's plan, the woman who seduced...

521
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,750
my innocent son, Dr. Choi.

522
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,389
It's all my fault.

523
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,630
It was my choice.

524
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,000
I'll head to bed.

525
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:17,869
Dr. Choi.

526
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,739
I get that you're mad at me.

527
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,969
But you have to know this one thing.

528
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,809
Every choice that I made in every moment...

529
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,679
was for your sake.

530
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,250
It was for my sake?

531
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,460
Every moment was for my sake?

532
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,260
I'm sorry, Mother,

533
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,760
but hearing that...

534
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,269
was like a shackle tied to me my whole life.

535
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,110
So, I made the wrong choice trying to get away from that.

536
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,980
Of course, it was an idiotic choice.

537
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,250
So, please stop saying that kind of stuff.

538
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,219
Fine, let's stop. All right.

539
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:17,058
My life has been like that.

540
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,559
I don't know why, though.

541
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,570
More than my life, I lived for my family.

542
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,440
Just to protect you.

543
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,369
Mother, please...

544
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:35,079
Please stop saying that, Mother!

545
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,050
Why did you do it? Why did you write out my life?

546
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,619
Why didn't you live your own life?

547
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,559
I'm not even your own son.

548
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,659
Why on earth did you do that to me?

549
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,289
Goodness.

550
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,659
Do Hyun.

551
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,800
Don't you have anything to tell me?

552
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:30,929
What is this about?

553
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,039
I wish you'd be honest with me.

554
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,210
Actually, at your age,

555
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,710
there must be things you don't want to tell your mom.

556
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,449
No, there's nothing like that.

557
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,159
I'll be honest too.

558
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,989
Today,

559
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,659
I got a strange text message.

560
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,530
She said she knew about your secret.

561
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,039
I'm scared.

562
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,280
I don't even know what your secret is.

563
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,750
But I'm scared that the person who knows about it...

564
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,449
might do something to you.

565
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,559
That's why I want to know.

566
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,860
Do Hyun. Even if...

567
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,260
you've committed a crime,

568
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,900
I will go through it with you and stand by your side.

569
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,699
So,

570
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,039
please, Do Hyun.

571
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,510
Couldn't you...

572
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,909
trust me?

573
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,289
Honestly,

574
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,630
it was a lie...

575
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,599
that So Yi is pregnant.

576
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,409
Why did you tell that kind of lie?

577
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
It's okay.

578
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,690
I'll understand, no matter what you say.

579
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,920
- Mom, you know Jun O, right? - Jun O?

580
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,329
The one who went to study abroad in the US?

581
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,670
- Yes. - Right.

582
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,869
We were going to go to Jun O.

583
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,439
Then, why did you lie that she was pregnant?

584
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,309
You could just go and visit him.

585
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,909
I want to stay with Jun O.

586
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:05,849
I like Jun O.

587
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,900
- Does that mean... - That's right.

588
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,469
We're in love.

589
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,349
Do Hyun.

590
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,989
I will...

591
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,420
accept all of your...

592
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,889
honest emotions.

593
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:44,530
But...

594
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,059
at your age,

595
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,230
you could become confused about your identity.

596
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:54,799
So, you shouldn't come to a conclusion so soon.

597
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,900
Mom.

598
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,639
I denied it myself countless times.

599
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:06,849
But it was true.

600
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,090
The more I became certain,

601
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,530
I became more scared...

602
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,900
of getting caught.

603
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:28,739
I wanted to deny it myself.

604
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,809
I could only imagine how it'd be if others found out about it.

605
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:44,119
If it was that hard on you,

606
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:49,690
you should've at least told me.

607
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:54,099
I wanted to remain a good son.

608
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,170
That's not the kind of son...

609
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:05,269
you wanted me to be.

610
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,519
In case everything you accomplished crumbled to nothing,

611
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:18,989
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

612
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,300
No, Do Hyun.

613
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,739
More than anything in this world,

614
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,940
I cherish you.

615
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,679
Don't worry.

616
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:47,880
I will...

617
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,219
stay by your side until the end.

618
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,289
I will...

619
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,460
protect you, my son.

620
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,948
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-eight, ninety-nine,

621
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:24,989
a hundred!

622
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,090
I'll start looking for you.

623
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,960
Ready or not, here I come.

624
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,829
Mom!

625
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,639
My sweetheart.

626
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,130
Dear my beloved Jae Jin.

627
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,969
They say success is not a temporary thing,

628
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,510
but a result of everyday routine.

629
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,779
I'm so proud of you...

630
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,380
for following my plans.

631
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,050
Jae Jin.

632
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,179
Don't hesitate nor do you cave in.

633
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,019
Just go up ahead.

634
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,420
I'll accompany you from behind.

635
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,920
You are the star of my life...

636
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,329
and my forever pride.

637
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,860
From your mom who cares only about you.

638
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:11,059
The weather is cold, Mother.

639
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,150
Oh, Lord.

640
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,489
How could this happen to our Do Hyun?

641
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,159
It might be just temporary.

642
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,928
I mean at that age,

643
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:50,500
one can easily go through that kind of confusion.

644
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,839
So what did you say?

645
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,869
Did you tell him that you understood and supported him?

646
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:00,340
Yes.

647
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,079
It's an absolute no.

648
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,780
I cannot accept this.

649
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,550
If we can't accept it, then what?

650
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,349
Honestly, it flustered me too.

651
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,489
But it's about his life. I want to respect his decision.

652
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:17,059
I'd respect it if it were someone else.

653
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,329
But not in my family.

654
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,968
If you can clearly see how hard your son's life...

655
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:25,098
is going to be,

656
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:27,539
you should take action as his mother.

657
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:30,209
You need to think carefully...

658
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,840
about what's best for Do Hyun.

659
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,139
Do Hyun...

660
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,679
must've been so scared...

661
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,849
until he confessed this secret.

662
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,980
He could have...

663
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,249
kept it from us and lied throughout his life.

664
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,659
But he chose not to do that.

665
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,829
And I'm so proud of him for it.

666
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,030
Of us all, it must be most confusing for him.

667
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:58,429
What we can do for him is...

668
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,840
Can't we just...

669
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,440
watch and support his decisions?

670
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,210
The kind of life he chose to live.

671
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,349
The problem is that Lee Se Na is aware of it.

672
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,260
So?

673
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,929
She'll probably blackmail me by threatening to expose it.

674
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:27,099
Or she could expose it right away.

675
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,000
Ms. No, are you going to be okay?

676
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,940
Can you give up on everything?

677
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,239
Yes.

678
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,480
I can give up on everything for my son.

679
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,320
Just as you did everything for Jae Jin,

680
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:51,989
I'll do everything to protect Do Hyun.

681
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,929
Son, you must've struggled a lot.

682
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,539
You should've at least told me.

683
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,309
I knew if I did, you'd tell Mom.

684
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,110
And when I wanted to tell you, you ran away from home.

685
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:23,989
You have...

686
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,960
the right to make as many choices as you want.

687
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:31,889
But I'm on Mom's side.

688
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,329
What you did is wrong.

689
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,880
Right.

690
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,650
I'm sorry...

691
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,679
for what I did wrong.

692
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:54,780
But Do Hyun,

693
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,050
just because your mom and I are on bad terms,

694
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,059
it doesn't mean our love for you has changed.

695
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,829
You know that, right?

696
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,929
Your mom and I...

697
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,199
love you just the way you are...

698
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:11,969
no matter how you come to be.

699
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:15,039
Right.

700
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:17,769
I get it now.

701
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,610
And Tae Oh was wrong about what he said.

702
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:24,380
Tae Oh?

703
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:27,980
He said someone like Mom would never understand me.

704
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,550
That if she found out about it,

705
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:33,920
she'd shun me.

706
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,940
(Where are you?)

707
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,210
Where are you?

708
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,059
Gosh.

709
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:20,099
You actually came.

710
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:21,840
I said I had something to tell you.

711
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:23,340
Have a seat.

712
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,610
You should have a glass.

713
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,579
Why did you do that to Do Hyun?

714
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,179
Why did you tell him that we wouldn't understand him?

715
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,420
- That's out of the blue. - Are you drunk?

716
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,820
Talk straight to me.

717
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,558
When he was going through such a thing,

718
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,658
you should've told him to share it honestly with us.

719
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:44,960
Calm down.

720
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,030
I was just being considerate of him.

721
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:52,269
And I doubt Ms. No would be able to understand him.

722
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:54,469
I doubt you're right about that.

723
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,079
Mr. Choi.

724
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,610
Why...

725
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,920
Why are you suddenly feeling for Ms. No?

726
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:14,659
Mr. Choi.

727
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,800
That was why...

728
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,800
you couldn't be honest with her.

729
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,570
You lied to her that I was your senior's son.

730
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,269
- That's not it. - No?

731
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:33,780
That's not it?

732
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:35,940
Then,

733
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,150
can you tell her...

734
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,579
how we met?

735
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,250

738
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,590
You can express anger now?

739
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,190
That's right.

740
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,969
My gosh. You've improved.

741
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,539
But Mr. Choi,

742
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,809
can you really do anything about it?

743
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:29,619
We'll move on to the next story. Hello?

744
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,760
Hello. I'm a mother with a son who is a sophomore in high school.

745
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:36,098
I had a concern I couldn't talk about with anyone.

746
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,400
I made the call thinking that today would be an opportunity.

You did well to call us.

Please tell Dr. No about your concern.

My son is interested in men.

750

I was so surprised and taken aback.

751
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,050
I heard you also had a son like my son.

752

What are you going to do with him?

753

It isn't bad.

772

There are times when you have to endure through spicy times.

This is what your grandmother thinks, Do Hyun.

774
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:30,340
I believe that is better...

775
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:32,469
than having a baby...

776
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:34,239

Being different from someone,

00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:50,460
many people tend to think that is something wrong.

782
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:55,698
I wanted your dad to be just like the others.

783
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:59,369
No. I wanted him to live at least like the others.

784
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:02,070
That is why I stuck to my own methods.

785
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,869
Will you do the same with me?

786
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:08,210
No.

787
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,510
Even if you are to face great pain on that path,

788
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,949
if that is what you want,

789

take that path.

790
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:21,889
I have finally realized this.

791
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:26,360
I should've given your dad his freedom of choice as well.

792

In life,

793
01:00:37,409 --> 01:00:40,170
there will be times when we have to endure through spicy times.

I knew it was for Do Hyun,

797
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:25,650
but that was a daring move to pretend to be pregnant.

798
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,260
Right.

799
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,130
I now understand why you did that.

800
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,599
Do Hyun likes Jun O.

This is a trap.
