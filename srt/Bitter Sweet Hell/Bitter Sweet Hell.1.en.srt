I'm tired. I'll eat later.

Don't be like that. Just eat.

11
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,579
It'll be more of a hassle to eat later.

12
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:12,278
No, I want to rest now because I'm tired.

13
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,118
I made food for you. Why are you getting angry?

(The couple doesn't understand each other's communication style.)

17
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,088
I get why they were called the Can't Communicate Couple.

18
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,728
From the husband's perspective, he did something for his wife,

19
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,328
but his wife got annoyed.

20
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,298
That must be why he expressed how upset he was.

21
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,467
Yes, the husband is definitely a nice person who takes good care...

22
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:34,598
of his wife.

23
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,139
However,

24
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,108
this is gaslighting.

25
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,009
- "Gaslighting?" - Yes.

26
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,307
Recently, we have suggested that people use the term,

27
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,948
"emotional and psychological control."

28
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:47,377
Since it usually happens between close relationships,

29
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:49,479
it takes the form of attachment.

30
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,717
It sometimes even happens among family members without recognition.

31
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,288
It could be something that anyone may have experienced,

32
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:58,459
and I could have gaslit someone else too.

33
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:01,128
Yes, people often say this.

34
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:02,829
"Family is precious."

35
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,098
"I'm saying all of this for your sake as your family."

36
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,368
I'm sure it's all said out of affection and love,

37
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,708
but overly insisting on something...

38
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,138
and blocking the emotional independence of a family member...

39
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,809
is not all right.

40
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:20,618
After hearing that, I think I should consider what I say...

41
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:23,648
to my husband and child too.

42
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:24,649
Yes.

43
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,389
In relationships with your spouse, parents, and children,

44
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,258
we must think about whether or not...

45
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,389
we are emotionally controlling someone...

46
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,459
in the name of love.

00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,699
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

50

00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,528
Of course.

61

It's hard going to school every morning, isn't it?

63
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,078
Can I just sleep for ten more minutes?

00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:27,009
Yes. I chose this.

I unbuttoned his shirt,

83

and his hands...

84
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,598
grabbed my head...

85
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,428

Gosh, sea bream sounds great.

100
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,249
Then, I should taste it.

101

That's perfect.

102
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,019
You and I have the same taste buds.

105

You can't even communicate with me on an emotional level.

Gosh, you two. Why are you bickering this early in the morning?

114
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:43,339
Ma'am, I'll do it.

115
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,708
Mother, I'll make you some toast.

116

Yes, early next month.

120

That doctor's award you're getting.

124

Dr. No is a national doctor.

128

But you've also done a good job, Ms. No.

132
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,269
Oh, Mother.

133
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,278
What should we do about our outfits for the award ceremony?

134
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:51,249
I usually pick out Jae Jin's outfits,

135
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:54,318
but you know how to dress for those formal events, Mother.

136
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:57,948
Our Dr. Choi looks great in anything,

137
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:01,589
but I'll tell CEO Kim about your outfit too, Ms. No.

138
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:03,688
All right.

139
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,859
Grandpa, please send me to Jeju Island.

140
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,458
Jeju Island? Why?

141
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:09,958
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?

142
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:12,098
Oh, So Yi said she was going to Jeju Island during the break...

143
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,129
for an English camp.

144
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:15,067
Can't you let me go too?

145
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:16,068
Do Hyun.

146
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:17,938
I see you're head over heels for So Yi.

147
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:19,369
So Yi?

148
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:22,678
Who do you take after that you fall in love so easily?

149
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:25,108
I wonder who.

150
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,578
It's not wrong that my grandson is a romanticist.

151
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,518
- Go on. - Really?

152
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,418
- Yes, go on. - Father, but the thing is...

153
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,188
It's all right.

154
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,098
- Let's go, Father. - Hold on.

155
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,168
Take this! Here.

156
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:49,599
Here.

157
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:51,538
You want this, don't you?

158
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,208
Here.

159
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,707
- Let's go. - Let's go, Father.

160
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,708
- Let's go. - Okay.

161
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:00,918
What should we do during lunch?

162
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,288
Hello. This is No Yeong Won's Clinic.

163
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,729
Yes. Thank you for the call, but I'm sorry.

164
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,129
Dr. No's schedule is fully packed.

165
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,399
Tell me about it.

166
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,839
Yes. Currently, appointments are available after six months.

167
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:57,139
I apologize. Bye.

168
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:01,639
Dr. No, people are urging us to take more appointments.

169
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,078
No. My son's in the 11th grade. I have to care for him in many ways.

170
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,918
Yeong Won.

171
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,118
You need to strike while the iron is hot.

172
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,719
Then, I'll make it bigger and drift apart from my family.

173
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,188
I tell you all the time.

174
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:15,787
Work is important,

175
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,188
- but my family is important too. - Your family is important too.

176
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,759
You're really like Wonder Woman.

177
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,399
You deal with all your work while taking care of your family.

178
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:26,999
Doesn't it suffocate you?

179
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,839
Breathe a little.

180
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:33,639
And my style of counselling isn't small profits and quick returns.

181
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,308
- It should be on another level. - Of course.

182
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,448
All right. Here's the list of today's patients.

183
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,879
- It's a new patient. - Right.

184
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:43,848
(Because Dr. No Yeong Won is pretty)

185
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:44,918
What on earth?

186
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:46,989
Because I'm pretty?

187
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:48,719
Exactly.

188
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,729
This way, please.

189
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,399
Dr. No, the patient is here.

190
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:02,198
Have a seat here.

191
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,068
Hello, Ms. Lee Se Na.

192
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,979
- Hello, Dr. No. - It's good to see you.

193
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,349
I really wanted to see you.

194
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:16,879
I waited so long, you see.

195
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,749
Really? I'm very sorry.

196
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,719
On the visitation route column,

197
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,058
you wrote "because Dr. No's pretty." You didn't mean it, did you?

198
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,229
- It's true. - Oh, really?

199
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,099
It's quite pleasing.

200
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,139
How's your suffocating symptom?

201
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,438
What about you?

202
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,278
Are you okay?

203
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:45,308
I feel suffocated sometimes.

204
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:49,479
I guess everyone has something that suffocates them. Right?

205
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:52,218
"I'm not the only one."

206
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,089
"It's the same for everyone else."

207
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:57,258
This way of thinking is one of the defence mechanisms.

208
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:00,928
You'll get better as you take time to look for the cause.

209
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:05,769
What do you think suffocates you?

210
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:15,438
Anxiety...

211
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:19,109
Frustration?

212
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,019
The truth is,

213
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:30,119
there's someone I love.

214
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,399
But he doesn't know how I feel.

215
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,129
So I feel like dying.

216
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:41,139
Like dying?

217
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,109
What about the other person?

218
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:47,808
Does that person know that you have this emotion?

219
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,349
He probably doesn't.

220
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:56,278
Which of your emotions do you want him to be aware of?

221
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:00,749
I'm anxious and frustrated that he seems unhappy.

222
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,688
He has a family that doesn't suit him.

223
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,828
A family that doesn't suit him?

224
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,629
How should I put it?

225
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,499
What frustrates me is that...

226
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,339
it's not because of my happiness that I want him to get divorced.

227
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:24,178
Why can't they get divorced when they stay married for show?

228
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,047
Why do they meaninglessly live together...

229
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,249
just because they're family?

230
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:29,979
Kind of like this.

231
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,918
I only...

232
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:38,528
want him to be happy.

233
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,229
Still, people might point their fingers at me.

234
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:48,999
Are you afraid of people's criticism?

235
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,509
Not really.

236
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,538
That's not important.

237
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:58,278
But...

238
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,578
I wonder...

239
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,818
what will happen if his family finds out about our relationship.

240
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:11,758
They know nothing about each other,

241
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,629
but they act like they do just because they're family.

242
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:15,298
It's a little pathetic.

243
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:21,698
Dr. No.

244
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:24,369
What about you?

245
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:26,239
What do you mean?

246
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,009
Do you know everything...

247
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,078
about your family?

248
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:34,578
Well,

249
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:39,188
a family doesn't always mean they know all about each other.

250
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:44,828
I see.

251
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:56,038
("Beast's Yesterday")

252
00:16:57,938 --> 00:16:59,407
"It's boring as expected."

253
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:00,537
(It's boring as expected.)

254
00:17:00,538 --> 00:17:02,008
You're more boring.

255
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,009
(I liked it. Don't mind them.)

256
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,178
Are you sure you haven't had a meltdown?

257
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,879
Would you not have a meltdown if you were me?

258
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,879
I bet a woman like her has no husband.

259
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:13,788
Even if she does, her husband will cheat on her for sure.

260
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,757
(I bet a woman like her has no husband.)

261
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:17,859
(Even if she does, her husband will cheat on her for sure.)

262
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:08,339
A little bit higher.

263
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:32,268
Goodness!

264
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,039
What are you doing?

265
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,668
What?

266
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:43,879
I'm appreciating that art piece right now.

267
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:53,049
I know that you have a weird taste,

268
00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:56,188
but let's please get rid of this iron plate.

269
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:59,228
I think I have a nightmare every night because of this.

270
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:02,198
What are you saying? This is my room.

271
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,129
Can't we turn off these lights?

272
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,998
Fine. Okay.

273
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,458
Who knows?

274
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,228
That thing might fall off.

275
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:58,018
Let their lives be valuable.

276
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,687
We thank you, and may you bless us in the name of Jesus Christ.

277
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,757
Amen.

278
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,119
- Amen. - Amen.

279
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:06,089
Amen.

280
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:14,738
- Prosecutor Choi. Long time no see. - Gosh.

281
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,098
I hope you're well.

282
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,437
Seeing you after a long time...

283
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:20,339
reminds me of when you were a prosecutor.

284
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,908
Oh, really?

285
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,707
Whenever I come here, the sight of the Public Prosecutors' Office...

286
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,649
makes me feel dizzy that I survived those times.

287
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,619
- Goodness. - Time flies.

288
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:33,819
Ma'am,

289
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:37,089
I heard it's hard to make an appointment at Dr. No's clinic.

290
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,188
My husband's nephew was asking.

291
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,698
Would it be hard even if I prayed?

292
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:44,899
- Dr. No. - Yes, Mother?

293
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:47,329
Why don't you make a room for her next week?

294
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,268
Mr. Lee's nephew's asking.

295
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,008
Is it possible, Dr. No?

296
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,838
To be honest,

297
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,809
I can't change the existing appointment for a favour.

298
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:01,718
One second.

299
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,349
I'm sorry,

300
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,789
but I'm fully booked for this month.

301
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,658
But if you give me your nephew's phone number,

302
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,829
I'll tell my manager to contact him.

303
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,427
Really?

304
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:21,839
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

305
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:23,497
- Chairman Lee. - Yes?

306
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,808
Dr. No will book an appointment.

307
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,238
Oh, my. Thank you, Dr. No.

308
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:29,539
You're welcome.

309
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,279
You must be so happy, Prosecutor Choi.

310
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:33,379
Yes, of course.

311
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:36,318
My daughter-in-law lets me put on airs.

312
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,319
Oh, no.

313
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,748
It's something I must do.

314
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:42,457
Considering the relationship between you and Father.

315
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,488
Thank you.

316
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:45,358
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

317
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,658
- Let's go. - Yes.

318
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,728
- It's great. - Yes, it sure is.

319
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:52,629
Let's go, Mother.

320
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,539
Amen.

321
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:01,779
Son.

322
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:04,678
Is everything all right?

323
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,708
What could possibly happen? It's always the same routine.

324
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,418
Is it...

325
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:10,849
What?

326
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:13,589
Is it about So Yi?

327
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:15,418
No.

328
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:17,059
No?

329
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,688
Did you get dumped?

330
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,658
No.

331
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:24,799
Then what is it?

332
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:26,428
Are you going out with her?

333
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:28,839
Gosh.

334
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:31,099
Tell me. I won't tell anyone.

335
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,539
As if. You'll tell everything to Mom if she asks.

336
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,279
I'm not the one who'd say that.

337
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:40,349
You let Mom control you.

338
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:48,819
That's because I love her.

339
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:51,589
What about So Yi? What's she like?

340
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:52,789
You don't need to worry.

341
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:55,198
She's completely different from Mom.

342
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:57,728
Is he following you?

343
00:22:57,998 --> 00:22:59,529
Are you crazy?

344
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,698
Look at his face.

345
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:02,738
So Yi.

346
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:05,738
What are you doing today?

347
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:12,809
It's about time to get a haircut.

348
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:14,978
You think so?

349
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:22,589
They're alike.

350
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:33,998
Yeong Won.

351
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,039
What are you doing here at this hour? You should be at work.

352
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:37,899
Gosh.

353
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:42,279
Yeong Won, I don't think I'm fit to be a salesman.

354
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:45,408
No, it's not that. I don't get along with doctors.

355
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:47,247
Why do I have to make myself available...

356
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,918
when doctors want to have a meal with me?

357
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:50,548
I have a life too.

358
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,319
That's exactly what salesmen like you do.

359
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:55,888
If you're going to keep that attitude, quit it.

360
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:57,658
Yes, so I quit.

361
00:23:58,329 --> 00:23:59,329
What?

362
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:02,029
Seriously! You little...

363
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,399
You quit again in less than a month?

364
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:07,129
I have plans.

365
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:08,568
Plans? What are they?

366
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:11,197
I'm going to start a start-up.

367
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:12,568
Start-up, my foot.

368
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:14,869
Yeong Won, I've thought about it.

369
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,177
We'll let people listen to your diagnosis...

370
00:24:18,178 --> 00:24:19,907
via call.

371
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,279
Or text messages.

372
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:24,478
It's kind of like the AI chatbot system.

373
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:27,789
We'll charge fees, so more people can...

374
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,487
Yeong Won. The world...

375
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,029
now operates on big data.

376
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,457
This isn't unprecedented.

377
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,458
Seriously.

378
00:24:37,658 --> 00:24:38,998
Yeong Won, think about it.

379
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,498
For more people to share your precious counselling,

380
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,267
no service is better than this.

381
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:47,309
People who live outside the city or abroad.

382
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:50,339
They're all your potential customers.

383
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,849
Can't you see the money?

384
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:53,609
No?

385
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:57,918
Gosh, this is an amazing idea. You're not influenced?

386
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,218
Yeong Won,

387
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:03,559
aren't you getting sick...

388
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:06,789
of dealing with people and counselling them?

389
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:12,299
How about trying something new and counselling dogs?

390
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:15,039
There are ten million people living with dogs now.

391
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:18,139
Dog camp with Dr. No Yeong Won.

392
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,168
- Isn't it... - You little...

393
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,778
People are totally wrong.

394
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,007
They think you're generous,

395
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,977
but they need to know how violent you are...

396
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:29,079
Cut it out.

397
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,988
- I'm disappointed... - Leave now.

398
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:38,389
I am leaving.

399
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:40,089
Stop urging me.

400
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,099
I'm disappointed.

401
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,458
My goodness.

- What's that? - What?

407
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:56,839
Nothing.

408
00:26:57,498 --> 00:26:59,938
I booked an appointment for Chairman Lee's nephew...

409
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,907
the week after.

410
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:03,707
Good job. Thanks.

411
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,507
Not even Chairman Lee can buy...

412
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:09,217
an appointment with you.

413
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:10,678
Stop it.

414
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:13,018
- Have a good day. - You too.

415
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:35,779
Okay.

416
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,448
Bear it with me.

417
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:44,948
Yeong Won, it's fine.

418
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:49,418
Sometimes you slip in life.

419
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,629
It hurts when I slip.

420
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:54,589
That's what ointment is for.

421
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,099
When it's more painful, you have me.

422
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:00,268
Here.

423
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,698
All done.

424
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,539
Yeong Won, life...

425
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,978
isn't always...

426
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,908
this smooth.

427
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,618
You might fail,

428
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,418
and sometimes you might slip like you just did.

429
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,718
So life goes...

430
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:28,957
up and down...

431
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,228
and that's how people become resilient.

432
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,828
Then are the slides on playgrounds...

433
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,728
there for you to practice slipping?

434
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,139
No.

435
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,369
I'm not going to slip.

436
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:20,109
Are you okay?

437
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,819
I'm okay. I'm fine.

438
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:56,948
Well done, Jae Jin.

439
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:18,639
Let's go eat.

440
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:20,839
Everyone must be hungry.

441
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,079
Okay.

442
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:26,609
We should.

Oh, Tae Oh.

448
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,688
What brings you here? You should've called me.

449
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,498
You have a plan for lunch already?

450
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,958
I should've called you.

451
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,329
Well...

452
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:52,738
Dr. Oh, I forgot that I had a prior engagement.

453
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:54,708
A prior engagement?

454
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,178
You didn't mention that.

455
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,408
I'm hungry.

456
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:00,849

Eat something delicious. Bye.

459
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:08,888
What is this? You didn't even call me.

460
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:09,889
I wanted to see you.

461
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:17,599
Doctor of the Year Award?

462
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,329
I expected that much from Dr. No.

463
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,299
But I didn't expect that Dr. Choi would also get it.

464
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:29,539
Ms. Kim, you usually don't have the best guesses.

465
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:33,578
Anyway, you must be so happy that both your son and daughter-in-law...

466
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:35,279
are receiving awards.

467
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,289
This outfit would be so nice for the awards ceremony too.

468
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,849
I don't know. Do I really have to go?

469
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:44,188
Aren't you going to the awards ceremony as well?

470
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:46,188
I'm not sure.

471
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,399
Then, where would you wear this kind of outfit?

472
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:56,167
By the way, when is our award winner...

473
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:57,799
coming in for a fitting?

474
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,668
How many years has it been since you've dressed our Dr. Choi?

475
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:03,738
Just choose something you see fit.

476
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,707
And you know, my dear Jae Jin.

477
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:10,248
He has no interest in receiving awards and whatnot.

478
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:13,119
No, I meant our dear Dr. No.

479
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,619
They say all the outfits that Dr. No wears are all the rage.

480
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:19,458
I feel quite pressured, you know.

481
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:23,129
When will she be here for her fitting?

482
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:24,998
What's with this?

483
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:30,938
Ms. Kim, you're not as good as you used to be.

484
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,369
You've lost your touch with this outfit.

485
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:50,158
(Soft Hands)

486
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:54,758

489
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:10,238
Welcome.

490
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,408
Does the broth...

491
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:42,238
suit your taste?

492
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:59,859
It's been a while.

493
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:01,728
Yes.

494
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,529
You've been well, haven't you?

495
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:09,839
But how is this place...

496
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:13,839
You asked me what one should eat when one feels empty inside.

497
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:19,078
At the time, this was the only dish that I served you.

498
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:22,208
I remembered how you liked it. In case the flavour changed,

499
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,179
I bought this place.

500
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,058
Is it too sweet?

501
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:34,359
I'll try it. Thank you.

00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:39,969
It's way too sweet.

503
00:34:40,098 --> 00:34:41,328
Have some coffee.

504
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:47,839
There's something I wanted to ask you.

505
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:51,178
Do Hyun is 18 years old, right?

506
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,179
Yes, he's in 11th grade.

507
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,847
I think you'd be a very friendly dad. Is that right?

508
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,518
Of course, we're like friends.

509
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:59,188
He and I have the worst brains in our house.

510
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,118
He used to be so adorable...

511
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,989
- Jae Jin. - Oh, honey.

512
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:08,688
- This is my husband, Jae Jin. - Right.

513
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:10,659
- Hello. - Hello.

514
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:13,299
- We'll go outside first. - Okay.

515
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:18,138
- You must've had lunch here too. - Yes.

516
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,938
This is a senior doctor's son. He just got accepted to medical school.

517
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,938
He's going to go to the same school as you.

518
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:27,549
Oh, I see. It's nice to meet you.

519
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:31,449
Hello. I'm Moon Tae Oh.

520
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:35,788
Haven't we met somewhere before? You seem familiar to me.

521
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:41,529
- Yes, we have. - Where?

522
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,399
On TV.

523
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:46,268
You're so famous.

524
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,968
- Well, then. You should eat. - Okay, I'll see you at home.

525
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:52,969
Okay, I'll see you later.

526
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:55,909
- It was nice to meet you. - Yes, have a safe trip home.

527
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,807
I feel like I just met a celebrity! Oh, gosh!

528
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:03,219
She must've had lunch here.

529
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:10,918
I was so nervous.

530
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,828
- You looked like it. - Did I?

531
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:27,839
Hey, Ra Kyung.

532
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:31,808
Yeong Won, a video is circulating on tabloids.

533
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:33,909
What is it?

534
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:35,109
Well, that is...

535
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:38,418
It's about your father's case.

536
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:41,819
Okay. Send it to me for now.

537
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:52,928
Dr. No Yeong Won has been saying that even family members...

538
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:56,367
should be cut off if they make you suffer.

539
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:57,938
But did you know this?

540
00:36:58,098 --> 00:37:01,168
That there is a family member that even she couldn't cut off.

541
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,037
Dr. No has a father who committed suicide.

542
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:05,807
It's known that he committed suicide...

543
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,577
while being investigated for embezzlement.

544
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:11,378
But you guys also know that he was also involved in...

545
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,649
a sexual harassment case, right?

546
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:16,219
What would she think of her father who sexually harassed someone?

547
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:19,057
She couldn't even cut off her own family member,

548
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:22,028
but she insists that her patients cut people off themselves.

549
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,557
Does it even make any sense...

550
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:25,969
that she can fix other people's mental health?

551
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,937
Hwang Ju Group's Director No Sun Ho was investigated...

552
00:37:35,938 --> 00:37:38,839
for embezzlement all night long and returned home early this morning.

553
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:42,307
The investigation began yesterday around 10am and lasted all night.

554
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:45,918
It ended around 5am today after 19 hours.

555
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,887
During the prosecution's investigation on the 22nd,

556
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:52,489
Mr. No was suspected of embezzling Hwang Ju Group's company funds.

557
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:09,938
Why did you do it?

558
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:13,978
- What are you saying? - Don't be like that, Sun Ho.

559
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:16,548
Secretary Song already made her statement...

560
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:18,219
that she was sexually harassed.

561
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,687
Don't you know me? I'm telling you, it's not true!

562
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:23,058
That's not what's important.

563
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:25,758
Secretary Song is making a very detailed...

564
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:27,558
and consistent statement.

565
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:28,688
Go Myeon.

566
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,399
You should trust me, no matter what anyone says!

567
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:34,929
I honestly don't know.

568
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:39,268
It's too late for me to get a handle on this.

569
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:40,868
I'll be going.

570
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:43,379
Go Myeon. Hey.

571
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:56,558
It's not true, Yeong Won.

572
00:38:57,288 --> 00:38:58,319
It's not.

573
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:00,429
I feel wronged.

574
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,029
I haven't done anything like that. I'm telling you the truth.

575
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:05,759
Prove it.

576
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,438
If you're telling the truth, you can prove it.

577
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:13,268
You said so yourself.

578
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:16,339
That you become resilient as you slip and fall.

579
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:20,609
You've slipped and fallen this far.

580
00:39:22,348 --> 00:39:23,779
You should become strong now.

581
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:27,918
You should protect your family, at least.

582
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:32,688
You're my dad.

583
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:01,549
Could you sign this, please?

So, did you look into it?

590
00:41:57,569 --> 00:41:59,038
I found no criminal records.

591
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,569
The social media account is clean too.

592
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:05,409
It's clean, Mr. Choi.

593
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:08,248
That's why it's weird, though.

594
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:11,379
Look more into it.

595
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,089
I'm sure there's something.

596
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:14,348
Roger that.

597
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:24,029
I'll have a glass of whiskey ready for you.

598
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,048
You're still drinking, Father.

599
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:45,149
- You didn't go to bed? - No.

600
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,957
Grab a glass and take a seat.

601
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,359
Let's drink after a long time.

602
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:52,958
Sure.

603
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,228
Let me pour you some.

604
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:01,469
- Will you? - Yes.

605
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:02,799
Here.

606
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:10,509
Are you concerned about something?

607
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:14,679
Well...

608
00:43:15,748 --> 00:43:17,478
I'm reminded of him a lot today.

609
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:21,618
I mean your father-in-law. Yeong Won's father.

610
00:43:22,388 --> 00:43:23,388
I see.

611
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:28,659
You should be good to her.

612
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:32,029
Yes, Father.

613
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:33,228
Good.

614
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:35,998
Jae Jin, come close.

615
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:39,537
Back in the past, I...

616
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:40,708
Jae Jin. Shouldn't you go to bed?

617
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,138
Dr. Choi, aren't you tired?

618
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:45,509
Well...

619
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,208
He's tired, and you...

620
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,489
I guess your mom still sees you as a little child.

621
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:58,118
Go to bed now. Rest up.

622
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:01,589
You drank a lot. You should go to bed after this.

623
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,129
Okay.

624
00:44:06,058 --> 00:44:07,129
Good night.

625
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:16,978
What are you unhappy about this time?

626
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:23,478
All your life, you cheated on me and hardly stayed home.

627
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:26,348
And now, you're suddenly playing father.

628
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:28,918
It's late, but it won't hurt.

629
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:30,819
And...

630
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:35,287
while he was growing up, you never let me go near him.

631
00:44:35,288 --> 00:44:36,629
Why do you think I did that?

632
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:40,529
He had nothing to learn from his father.

633
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,239
Keeping a son away from anything dirty.

634
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:47,208
That's called maternal instinct.

635
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,878
Countless affairs you've had.

636
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:51,178
What you've done behind Jae Jin's back.

637
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:53,379
And what I've done to keep your prosecutor title.

638
00:44:53,748 --> 00:44:55,779
I won't ask you to be grateful for those.

639
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:58,819
So,

640
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:03,089
just don't get on my nerve.

641
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:06,589
Oh, you did that for me just now?

642
00:45:07,828 --> 00:45:10,029
You did that for our family?

643
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:11,899
No, you didn't.

644
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:15,328
It was all to keep your graceful image.

645
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:18,868
Why? You'll be humiliated if the truth is exposed.

646
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:22,469
Don't make me laugh.

647
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:25,909
You have zero sense of empathy, don't you?

648
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:31,478
All these years, I've protected you...

649
00:45:33,049 --> 00:45:36,049
for you're part of my family.

650
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:39,518
But I regret it so much.

651
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,997
Look. Madam Hong Sa Kang.

652
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:47,327
Do you really think our family and all that we have...

653
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,399
could be protected only through your efforts?

654
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,239
Regret?

655
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:55,638
Your arrogance and prejudice...

656
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:59,379
are ruining your life and that of Jae Jin.

657
00:46:00,978 --> 00:46:01,978
You know that?

658
00:46:17,328 --> 00:46:18,328
There.

659
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:22,969
Not like that.

660
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:25,368
Good dog.

661
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:27,339
Slow down.

662
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:28,708
We're almost there.

663
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:34,009
Goodness.

664
00:46:36,618 --> 00:46:38,578
I'm okay, Jae Bok.

665
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:40,489
It could've been bad.

666
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:27,468
My dear daughter-in-law, you remind me...

667
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,328
of the flower language, eternal beauty. Cheer up.

668
00:47:35,638 --> 00:47:36,779
Hi, Jae Jin.

669
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:41,409
Yes.

670
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:44,319
What's wrong?

671
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:20,549
(Condolences)

672
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,568
Goodness. Go Myeon.

673
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:43,678
You took such care of yourself,

674
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,308
so how could you get slammed by a rock to death?

675
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:52,049
You were never the kind of person who would die like that.

676
00:48:52,518 --> 00:48:55,788
- Goodness. Go Myeon. - Should we escort her home?

677
00:48:56,288 --> 00:48:59,489
Go Myeon.

678
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:09,228
- Go Myeon! - Please go on in.

679
00:49:11,638 --> 00:49:12,668
It will be okay.

680
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:18,807
I'll have the car ready.

681
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:20,949
Mr. An, you should stay here.

682
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,748
You know my father's mourners well.

683
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:28,649
Well... Let me drive her home.

684
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:30,058
Will you do that?

685
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:32,118
Thank you, Dr. Oh.

686
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:17,938
Dr. No.

687
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:27,109
Ms. Lee Se Na?

688
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,949
What are you doing here?

689
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,518
Do you know my father-in-law?

690
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:56,779
The truth is,

691
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,509
there's someone I love.

692
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:03,748
He has a family that doesn't suit him.

693
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:08,188
Why can't they get divorced when they stay married for show?

694
00:51:09,018 --> 00:51:10,988
Why do they meaninglessly live together...

695
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:12,118
just because they're family?

696
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:14,529
Kind of like this.

697
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:20,899
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:22,668 --> 00:51:24,399
I'll see you again, Dr. No.

699
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:14,719
Right. You won't feel like eating either.

700
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,078
Just a moment.

701
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:45,018
Prosecutor Choi loved this photo.

702
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:50,089
It has been quite some time since you started working for him.

703
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:52,219
It has been 15 years.

704
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:56,828
He made a joke about it, telling me to work for him...

705
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,359
for at least 20 years, even though I may be sick of him.

706
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:01,399
He really liked you.

707
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:06,038
Thank you for staying with us.

708
00:53:37,138 --> 00:53:39,498
I should've had another glass with you, Father.

709
00:55:38,388 --> 00:55:39,917
(My dear Go Myeon, how are you doing?)

710
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:41,529
(How would things be if you were still alive? Did you have to leave?)

711
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:49,668
(1990 to 1998)

712
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,149
(Singing practice, "Three Bears")

713
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:07,518
Look at me.

714
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:14,057
There are three bears in a house

715
00:56:14,058 --> 00:56:17,859
Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear

716
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:21,998
Daddy bear is fat

717
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:24,239
(Ballet practice)

718
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:37,879
(Ballet practice)

719
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:44,118
Prosecutor Choi,

720
00:56:45,018 --> 00:56:46,558
take care of Director No.

721
00:56:47,888 --> 00:56:51,098
And you have to join us in Hwang Ju Group.

722
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:53,728
But sir,

723
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:56,528
he's such an upright person.

724
00:56:56,529 --> 00:56:58,569
I don't think Director No will just sit back and take it.

725
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:02,508
That is why we must get him involved...

726
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:04,938
with this sexual harassment case for sure.

727
00:57:05,308 --> 00:57:06,409
Yes, then,

728
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,378
you mean that the secretary will give a false statement...

729
00:57:09,379 --> 00:57:10,949
that she was sexually harassed by Director No, right?

730
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:12,549
But sir,

731
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:15,548
that female secretary must clearly do her part.

732
00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:16,618
You know this, right?

733
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:18,489
Of course.

734
00:57:19,558 --> 00:57:20,659
All right.

735
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,688
We'll give it a try.

736
00:57:23,388 --> 00:57:26,998
Sir, the female secretary must clearly do her part.

737
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,968
We'll be in big trouble if there are talks about a false statement...

738
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,299
and that nothing actually happened. You know this, right?

739
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:34,708
She will definitely do her part.

740
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:37,009
Do you know how much I paid her?

741
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:59,497
It's not true, Yeong Won. I feel wronged.

742
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:01,598
If you're telling the truth, you can prove it.

743
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:03,498
You should protect your family, at least.

744
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:15,048

746
00:58:21,118 --> 00:58:22,149
Yeong Won.

747
00:58:27,728 --> 00:58:29,489
Hey, Jae Jin. Come down.

748
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,199
Yeong Won!

749
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:31,078
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

750
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,707
There are rumours that your mother-in-law was the one...

751
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,348
who killed your father-in-law.

752
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:05,818
Prosecutor Choi's death...

753
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:09,118
was exactly the same as Novelist Hong's novel.

754
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:11,458
When is that conference until?

755
01:01:12,188 --> 01:01:14,288
There wasn't a conference for plastic surgery.

756
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:16,259
I have returned safely.

757
01:01:16,929 --> 01:01:20,768
I'm proud of the things we were able to achieve until now.

758
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:23,068
Did you know about this?

759
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,168
Is that important?

760
01:01:24,638 --> 01:01:27,137
Family members must not know everything about each other.

761
01:01:27,138 --> 01:01:28,239
Is this really true?
