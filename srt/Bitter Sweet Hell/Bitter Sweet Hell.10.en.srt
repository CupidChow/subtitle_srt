1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,009
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,040
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,279
Madam, here is the Dear Margaux 2005 you mentioned.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,279
Oh, you found it.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,288
The 2005 is acknowledged as...

7
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,789
the best vintage even in Bordeaux.

8
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,719
It's a very rare wine.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,160
It's a wine you can't help but love.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Hemingway loved this win so much...

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,800
that he named his granddaughter Margaux Hemingway.

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,539
- Please prepare it well. - Yes, ma'am.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,869
What is the occasion today that you're paying so much attention?

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,810
It's the kids' tenth wedding anniversary.

15
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,009
They got married in 2005.

16
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,119
You're so meticulous.

17
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,689
They're my family. I should take care of them.

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,390
Okay, then I'll prepare it well.

19
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,130
Madam Hong has prepared this wine for you.

20
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,768
Oh, Mother did?

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,799
Yes.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,680
A toast.

23
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,540
(VIP, Jung Sun Hee, Honghak Hospital)

24
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,319
(VIP, Jung Sun Hee, Honghak Hospital)

25
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,319
Who are you, ma'am?

26
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,030
If you watch TV until too late, you won't be able to sleep well.

27
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,060
When you can't sleep,

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,629
this kind of thing is all right too.

29
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,680
Is it time for me to go to sleep?

30
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,389
I'm sleepy.

31
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,960
I want to sleep.

32
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,659
Lie down.

33
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,110
Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea."

34
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,740
Have you read it?

35
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,550
An old fisherman, who's on a sailboat by himself,

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,349
spends four days and nights...

37
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,560
in a grueling fight to catch a marlin.

38
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,360
Of course, he successfully catches the fish,

39
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,800
but on his way home, he meets a bunch of sharks.

40
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,330
He loses everything...

41
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,110
except the bones of the marlin left on his boat.

42
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,840
"Now, home won't be too far away."

43
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,419
The old fisherman doesn't despair.

44
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,789
He thinks about those who worry about him,

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,460
and he returns home safe and sound.

46
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,159
I think Yeong Won was the one...

47
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,030
who made that kind of home for me.

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,370
Ms. Jung.

49
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,039
Today is the kids' tenth wedding anniversary.

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,449
As long as the kids are happy,

51
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,020
that's all that matters.

52
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,050
Director No would understand too.

53
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,388
(Restricted Number)

54
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,360
(What would it feel like for the world to know your family's secret?)

55
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,430
That's why I'm saying this.

56
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,768
I think I should handle...

57
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,769
a girl who's as crazy as you.

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,310
Lee Se Na.

59
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,810
I told you that I'd handle you.

60
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,199
(Monday, December 25)

61
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,290
Ms. No.

62
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,019
Mother.

63
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,970
- Are you okay? - I'm not sure.

64
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,740
I don't know...

65
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,149
I think I just lost consciousness for a little while.

66
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:55,949
How did you get here?

67
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,879
I got a text message...

68
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,819
saying they'd reveal our secrets.

69
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,319
I thought it was Lee Se Na.

70
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,529
So, I was going to take care of this myself.

71
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,529
I was going to meet with her...

72
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,930
and put an end to all this.

73
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,430
Did you meet with Lee Se Na?

74
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,370
Someone attacked me.

75
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,379
I think I was in a scuffle.

76
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,269
But I didn't kill him. It wasn't me.

77
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,070
I didn't kill him.

78
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,139
Mother, you have to pull yourself together.

79
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,509
Okay.

80
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,379
Stay where you are.

81
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,750
We're the police.

82
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,070
Yes, I just sent you an address.

83
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
Please send backup.

84
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,600
A murder case.

85
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,840
One victim. Two suspects.

86
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,809
Given the circumstances,

87
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,850
we'll have to take you both in to the station.

88
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,169
(Police)

89
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,309
(Chapter 10: Gone Night)

90
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,879
It was Dr. No Yeong Won, right?

91
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,580
She probably has almost everything. What's going on?

92
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,490
There you go again with your useless worries.

93
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,450
This is not yours to concern.

94
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,959
Still, she got caught right at the murder scene.

95
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,059
I wonder what she will do.

96
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,690
The other woman was her mother-in-law, right?

97
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,289
Don't jump to conclusions.

98
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,230
We aren't sure who murdered the victim yet.

99
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,298
But given the circumstances,

100
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,799
her mother-in-law is most likely the culprit, no?

101
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,809
We'll see about that.

102
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,109
Go and collect everything you find.

103
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,340
Yes, sir.

104
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,889
You went to the vacation home after receiving the text?

105
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,789
Yes.

106
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,929
You must be frustrated because of your son.

107
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,470
I don't think that's frustrating.

108
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,500
Well, right.

109
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,100
Anyway,

110
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,940
you said this woman named Lee Se Na sent you this text.

111
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,979
But it was a burner phone that it can't be tracked.

112
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm sure of it.

113
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,518
She called me as soon as I got the text.

114
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,849
It's not that you recorded the call.

115
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,120
You can't prove that the caller was Lee Se Na.

116
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,989
Anyway, when you came to the vacation home,

117
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,429
Lee Se Na wasn't there, and you found An Yo Sub dead.

118
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,960
And your mother-in-law, Hong Sa Kang, was there.

119
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,000
Is this correct?

120
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,570
Yes.

121
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,569
You said when you arrived at the vacation home,

122
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,539
somebody attacked you.

123
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,139
Given the circumstances, that was most likely An Yo Sub.

124
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,179
It was so dark...

125
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,720
that I didn't get to see who it was.

126
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:29,320
And the person made me pass out.

127
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,389
I'm sure they used a cloth with chloroform on it.

128
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,929
The dead man is speechless.

129
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,370
The killer has no memory.

130
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,570
I didn't kill him.

131
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,109
Something happened...

132
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,710
while I was unconscious.

133
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,980
But no evidence proves that you passed out.

134
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,109
So how can we be sure that you didn't kill him?

135
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,320
Because I'm not that kind of person.

136
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,990
I wondered who Lee Se Na was.

137
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,190
Oh, dear. She was your husband's mistress,

138
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,528
and you recently reported her to the police.

139
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,559
She has been...

140
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,668
blackmailing me.

141
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,298
Mr. An Yo Sub testified...

142
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,538
that Lee Se Na had nothing to do with it.

143
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,669
Thus, she was released for lack of evidence.

144
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,470
Given your situation,

145
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,080
you must've been very angry at him. Right?

146
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,709
I wouldn't kill someone out of anger.

147
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,779
Right.

148
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,980
You may not have intended to murder him.

149
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,918
We'll have to wait...

150
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,059
for the exact estimated time of death and autopsy result.

151
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,959
But both Ms. Hong and you...

152
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,758
had a good enough motive...

153
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,000
to murder Mr. An Yo Sub.

154
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,330
Or you may be accomplices.

155
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Accomplices?

156
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,570
Look.

157
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,779
Let me make this one thing clear.

158
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,250
Ms. No...

159
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,519
arrived after I woke up.

160
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,179
I clearly remember this.

161
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,750
And Ms. No wouldn't do such a thing.

162
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,960
Are you admitting that you were alone...

163
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,658
at the murder scene?

164
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,758
No! My mother-in-law would never do such a thing.

165
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,369
This is a trap.

166
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,469
Lee Se Na is trying to frame us for murder.

167
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,970
This was why you seemed awkward around your mother and wife.

168
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,240
Well, I understand.

169
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:37,250
Speaking of which, are you in touch with Ms. Lee Se Na?

170
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,119
Both of them are pointing her out.

171
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,190
No.

172
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,989
If Lee Se Na is caught,

173
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,788
will it prove their innocence?

174
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:47,789
No.

175
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,158
It'll hardly be proven...

176
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,700
unless she admits it herself.

177
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,928
For now, your mother and wife...

178
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,768
seem to have had a clearer motive to murder Mr. An Yo Sub.

179
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,739
No. Detective,

180
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,679
my mother and wife would never kill anyone.

181
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,779
Mr. Choi Jae Jin.

182
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,649
A crime scene never lies.

183
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,179
If they're innocent, the investigation will reveal it.

184
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,669
(Cell 10)

185
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,340
(Cell 1)

186
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,309
(Detention Room)

187
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
(People's Police Faithful to the Basics)

188
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,619
Ms. No. You may go home now.

189
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,129
Oh, and your car is still being investigated.

190
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,799
Come to reclaim it once the investigation is over.

191
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,630
I'm sorry for the trouble.

192
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,599
You've been acquitted.

193
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,869
Madam Hong...

194
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,579
seems to have strongly claimed that she was alone at the scene.

195
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,508
(That's right. Ms. No is never the culprit.)

196
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,950
(Mr. An was already dead.)

197
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,949
What about my mother-in-law?

198
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,348
The fingerprints found from the murder weapon...

199
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,990
and the DNA found at the scene...

200
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,890
all match Madam Hong's.

201
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,859
What is going to happen, then?

202
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,528
The police are intending to spot her...

203
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,700
as the prime suspect.

204
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,430
We won't know until the autopsy result comes out,

205
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,469
but if the victim did die of a stab wound,

206
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,769
it won't be easy for her to avoid the charge.

207
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,069
She must have planned...

208
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,509
to target me.

209
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,910
I guess there was a variable.

210
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,450
Because of me, you...

211
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,250
No. Ms. No.

212
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,618
If her plan went south,

213
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,319
this is actually better.

214
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,858
It would've been game over...

215
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,319
had you been framed according to her plan.

216
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,960
And...

217
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,298
I think it's better for me to be at a place like this...

218
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,230
than you.

219
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,969
Mother.

220
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,740
Don't give me that look.

221
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,469
I'm just saying I'm stronger than you...

222
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,880
to handle something like this.

223
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,679
The evidence found at the scene...

224
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,990
is what could easily be fabricated.

225
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,890
Don't worry.

226
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
I'll find evidence that proves it's Lee Se Na's doing.

227
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,559
At first, I also thought it'd be Lee Se Na.

228
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,960
But...

229
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,140
it certainly was a man who attacked me.

230
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,740
It wasn't Lee Se Na but a man?

231
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,380
Don't you have any hypnotizing skills?

232
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,509
Pardon?

233
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,890
As soon as I entered the living room,

234
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,119
someone covered...

235
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,630
my mouth and nose from behind.

236
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,529
He was quite tall.

237
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,799
My head touched his chin.

238
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,539
Something rustling annoyingly too much.

239
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,170
I used my elbow...

240
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,240
to push him as hard as I could.

241
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,279
He shouted quietly.

242
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,180
It was a man. I'm sure of it.

243
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,019
The living room was pitch dark.

244
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,220
He pushed me down.

245
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,359
I grabbed something.

246
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,390
I hit his head with it.

247
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,500
But he covered my mouth with a cloth again.

248
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,369
It was so degrading.

249
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,099
And?

250
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,470
I don't remember.

251
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,210
Was that...

252
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,910
really Mr. An?

253
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,349
Even so,

254
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,049
someone killed Mr. An.

255
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,289
Although that murderer disappeared without a trace.

256
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,430
Do you know the trick...

257
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,460
of a locked room murder case in mystery novels?

258
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,369
That the murderer is someone who is never on the suspect list.

259
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,440
Then who could it be?

260
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,039
Who is Lee Se Na's another unpredictable assistant?

261
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
Mother.

262
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,349
You need to bring back your memories as much as you can.

263
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,920
Yes, I will try.

264
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,759
Is Dr. Choi...

265
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,170
in shock?

266
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,769
I guess he can't face you.

267
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,140
Right.

268
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,579
I don't want to see him right now either.

269
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,619
You should get going.

270
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,450
I'll talk to Lawyer Ko.

271
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,059
Yes, Mother.

272
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,910
Honey.

273
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,220
Right now...

274
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,749
- What are you doing? - Come out.

275
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,660
- This is going to be a hit. - Yes.

276
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,858
They're here.

277
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,459
- Hello. - Anything to say?

278
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,759
Dr. No, I'm from Military Monster.

279
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,929
Do you find it unfair?

280
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,900
Then don't hesitate to call us.

281
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,868
Any word to the victim?

282
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:19,268
Do you admit the crime?

283
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,598
- Later. - Don't push.

284
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,440
I'm from Mint Chocolate Fans. If your mother-in-law's a murderer,

285
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,578
- it's darn shocking. - Darn shocking!

286
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,880
- That's totally shocking. - Yes.

287
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,410
My mother...

288
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,680
isn't a murderer.

289
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,990
The truth will be revealed soon.

290
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,518
- Get out of the way. - Come on. Say something.

291
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,528
- Let me go. - Let me pass through.

292
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,058
- Don't push me. - Anything to say?

293
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,588
Say something, will you?

294
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,129
Please say something.

295
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,929
- Say something before you go. - Remember it's Military Monster.

296
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,298
What were you doing in the scene?

297
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,169
- Are you going home? - Don't just leave.

298
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,669
Don't you know when to stay out?

299
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,969
We're going to chase you to the end.

300
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,409
Say something to the victim's family.

301
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,039
You can't just leave like this.

302
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,909
Are they leaving?

303
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,410
Hurry up and chase them.

304
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,519
Dr. No's family gives me the chills.

305
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,119
I wonder what they said when they called him to the vacation home.

306
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,190
He was their driver.

307
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:15,289
He couldn't say no to their boss' order.

308
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,298
The phone is turned off.

309
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,930
- Dang it. - Please leave a message...

310
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,769
You little...

311
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,710
Have you seen the news?

312
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,710
Of course.

313
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,210
I knew she could be really scary, but I didn't expect her to murder.

314
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,150
Jae Jin must be in huge shock.

315
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:48,730
Perhaps he might see this as a chance.

316
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,329
A chance?

317
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,798
He always wanted to get away from his family,

318
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,829
and Madam Hong...

319
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,170
couldn't let him.

320
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:00,339
That's true.

321
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,569
If it weren't for Madam Hong,

322
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,140
he wouldn't have lived that way.

323
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,109
Only if Madam Hong was gone...

324
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,588
Get rid of the person you want...

325
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,789
without getting your hands dirty?

326
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,630
It's definitely a chance.

327
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,029
Am I wrong?

328
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,839
Her fingerprints were found. She's guaranteed to be imprisoned.

329
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,779
By the way,

330
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,779
do you think Madam Hong really killed him?

331
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,650
Are you getting weak-hearted again?

332
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,259
You know what they say?

333
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,859
Give him an inch, and he'll take a mile.

334
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,900
If you keep acting nice, people will...

335
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,630
They'll think you're a pushover. Are you?

336
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm no pushover.

337
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,869
Why does everyone say that but don't get into action?

338
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,849
Sorry.

339
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,250
I just don't want you...

340
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,450
to lose your chance again and regret it. I mean it.

341
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,869
Uncle Kang Sung.

342
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,240
What's the fuss?

343
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,640
A chef...

344
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,910
must keep his mouth and body calm.

345
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,549
Look at this.

346
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,618
It's about Madam Hong.

347
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:56,819
("Dr. No's Mother-in-law under Arrest as Murder Suspect")

348
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,059
("Dr. No's Mother-in-law under Arrest as Murder Suspect")

349
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,730
Uncle Kang Sung. That's hot.

350
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,230
Uncle Kang Sung. Your hand.

351
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,769
It's hot.

352
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:14,970
Let's talk about the details in person.

353
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,910
Ra Kyung, don't respond to anyone.

354
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,979
- Okay. - Okay.

355
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,680
- Call me later. - Yes.

356
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,799
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,539
I deserve to die.

358
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,210
It's all my fault.

359
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:52,609
No matter what kind of decision you make,

360
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,210
I have nothing to say.

361
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,849
If it's too much for you to handle,

362
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,859
you can leave this home.

363
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,759
Okay.

364
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,259
I will leave.

365
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,170
To be honest, I've never thought...

366
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,839
about our relationship that much.

367
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,150
I don't know what to do from now on.

368
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,349
We have to catch Lee Se Na first.

369
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,359
With what happened to Mother,

370
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,930
I have no room to think.

371
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,799
You're right.

372
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,099
I'm sorry.

373
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,420
If you're sorry, get a hold of yourself.

374
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:15,359
You need to protect your family first.

375
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,059
Yes.

376
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,299
I will try everything I can.

377
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,640
- Yeong Won, are you home? - Gosh.

378
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,399
What is going on?

379
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,808
What brings all of you at once?

380
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,639
I heard my sister was released. Is she not home yet?

381
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,249
She is. She's upstairs.

382
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,349
- Upstairs? - Yes.

383
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,119
How could this happen?

384
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,119
I know.

385
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,960
It's not as bad as I thought.

386
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,960
I promise you I will find...

387
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,269
who did this. And when I do,

388
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,200
I'll clear your charges...

389
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,170
Do you trust me?

390
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,839
Of course, I do.

391
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,309
Why do you trust me?

392
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,380
For what?

393
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,349
A lot of people may think...

394
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,519
I'm more than capable of doing that.

395
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,819
You said all greens are...

396
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,460
poisonous.

397
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,569
Because they can't run away like animals,

398
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:32,069
they become poisonous...

399
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,839
in order to protect themselves.

400
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,779
I still remember how sad you were...

401
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,809
when you said that.

402
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,849
That's what you're doing.

403
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,890
In order to defend yourself,

404
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,130
you're holding poison.

405
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,210
Spill it out already.

406
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,450
Yes, I ran here as soon as I saw the news.

407
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,609
As the news says,

408
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,750
Mother's in the police station.

409
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,390
Is it true that she's a murder suspect?

410
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,960
A murder? What do you mean?

411
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,929
Well, it's no surprise even if she killed someone...

412
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,828
with that temper.

413
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:34,859
Aunt.

414
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,900
I mean,

415
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,900
considering how dogged she is.

416
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,439
I just meant that she was spiteful.

417
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,670
It wasn't murder.

418
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,509
I think someone framed her on purpose.

419
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:48,440
Who framed her?

420
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,849
There was someone who threatened our family recently.

421
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,549
I think it was that person's doing.

422
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,890
Then,

423
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
was it Lee Se Na?

424
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,929
Lee Se... Lee Se Na?

425
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,799
Oh, my. The Lee Se Na who had an affair with Jae Jin?

426
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,859
- Auntie. - Oh, right.

427
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,130
Sorry.

428
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,969
Anyway, if it was that woman,

429
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,038
it should've been Yeong Won who killed that woman.

430
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,169
Why would Sa Kang do that?

431
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,440
Auntie. She didn't kill anyone.

432
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,349
So...

433
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,279
Lee Se Na wasn't the person who died. It was Mr. An.

434
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,149
- Oh, Mr. An. - Yes.

435
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,588
The guy with the matted hair.

436
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,959
He really did smell rotten.

437
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,160
You smelled him?

438
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,029
- Yes. - Anyway,

439
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,529
Mother will clear her name.

440
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,729
Didn't Mr. An get on Sa Kang's nerves?

441
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,170
You're sure she was framed, right?

442
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,269
I believe in Grandma.

443
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,038
Great Aunt. My grandma is a totally cool person.

444
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,249
She isn't mean enough to kill someone...

445
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,008
just because they got on her nerves.

446
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,680
Gosh, Do Hyun...

447
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,319
That wasn't what I meant.

448
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,589
Everyone,

449
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:08,559
let's believe in each other more in times like these.

450
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:21,000
Dr. No, the police are... Well...

451
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,369
The police?

452
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,680
What...

453
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,980
Sa Kang?

454
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,889
She's the typical daughter of a wealthy family.

455
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,990
She acts like she's the only person who's elegant.

456
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,328
My brother was such an affectionate man.

457
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:46,500
But seeing how he was so cold toward Sa Kang...

458
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,929
So, you know how...

459
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,629
my brother's death and Sa Kang's novel...

460
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,940
are the same?

461
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,538
Well, he wouldn't have any excuse even if she did kill him.

462
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,368
He had so many affairs.

463
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,879
To be honest, when Sa Kang looked down on my brother,

464
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,079
I felt so refreshed too.

465
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,719
Actually, I looked up to Sa Kang.

466
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,420
My dear Sa Kang...

467
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,230
She's doing all right, isn't she?

468
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,559
We weren't all that close.

469
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,530
Well, we were just in-laws.

470
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,428
And a critical thing was...

471
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,468
when she introduced me to a company,

472
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,969
but it turned out to be a very insignificant place.

473
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,070
I was quite upset because of that.

474
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,639
You know, I may not seem like it,

475
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,039
but I have such an amazing idea for a business.

476
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,109
If you're interested, detective, I'll explain it to you.

477
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,078
I mean, she has so much money.

478
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,279
She wouldn't even invest in my business...

479
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,718
But still, that doesn't mean I have a grudge against Madam Hong, okay?

480
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,888
Even if she really killed someone,

481
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,559
she's the type of person to say,

482
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,030
"Yes, I did kill that person."

483
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,429
Someone she might hold a grudge against?

484
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,300
Gosh, that's not... It could be possible.

485
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,429
Madam Hong is such a cold person.

486
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,940
She's such a cold person, but she likes iced tea so much.

487
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,670
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,768
But you know how some people are cold only on the outside?

489
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,538
Should I say that Madam Hong is one of those people?

490
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,980
When my kid was sick,

491
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,678
she paid for all of our hospital bills...

492
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,619
while acting like she didn't know anything.

493
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,319
She's such a warm-hearted person.

494
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,119
How did she end up...

495
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,489
Think of it as a paid vacation and take some time off for now.

496
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,960
Yes. You can call me anytime.

497
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,699
- And here. - But...

498
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,469
Thank you.

499
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,639
Hello.

500
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,379
Then, I'll be going now.

501
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,440
Okay.

502
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,719
I wasn't able to call you beforehand.

503
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,449
No, that's fine. But...

504
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,119
It looks like there's an investigation going on.

505
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,960
It is pretty fascinating.

506
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:56,159
Oh, but are you okay?

507
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:58,630
Do Hyun, and now Madam Hong...

508
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,599
I heard you knew about Do Hyun.

509
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,768
You could've told me about it before.

510
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:08,239
Oh, you were offended. I'm sorry.

511
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,309
As you know, it's a difficult topic to talk about.

512
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,739
I don't think we'll be able to continue with tutoring for now.

513
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,309
As you can see, our family situation isn't that great.

514
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,979
I'm sorry when you came all this way.

515
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,750
What? Dr. No. One moment.

516
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,689
I get how you feel,

517
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,788
but wouldn't it be better for Do Hyun to stick to his routine...

518
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,158
even more in times like these?

519
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,230
No.

520
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,760
I think he would need more time with his family in times like these.

521
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,369
Dr. No...

522
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:43,909
Hey, one moment.

523
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:48,078
Dr. No told me not to come for tutoring for the time being.

524
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,610
I have nothing to say to you.

525
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,250
- Will you please leave? - What?

526
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,219
Yes, sir.

527
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,689
Gosh, thank you for all your hard work, officers.

528
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,420
You must be finished with the investigation.

529
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,820
Oh, I'm the tutor for this family's son.

530
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,400
Then, you must know about this family quite well.

531
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,530
Wasn't there anything strange recently?

532
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Yes, actually...

533
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,940
I did find something odd recently.

534
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,480
There's this person named Dr. Oh Ji Eun.

535
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,880
She left Madam Hong's room crying not too long ago.

536
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,980
But she's an adult, not a little kid.

537
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,190
I don't know what she heard to make her cry like that.

538
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,920
Ms. Oh Ji Eun?

539
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,459
- Thank you. - Of course.

540
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,158
- Thank you. - Welcome.

541
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,489
- Have a good day. - Thanks.

542
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,369
Yes, she'd be capable of murder.

543
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,780
She's a scary person.

544
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,579
Someone who can do anything that she wants.

545
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:37,050
I saw that Ms. Hong Sa Kang sponsored you, Ms. Oh.

546
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,320
Well, the pretext was a sponsorship,

547
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:44,158
but she did that to make me do something that family needed.

548
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,300
What was that, specifically?

549
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,630
She sent me to medical school...

550
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,769
to have her son become a doctor.

551
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,940
To make me perform surgery instead of him.

552
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,840
And you did as you were told?

553
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,539
If I didn't,

554
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,440
I thought she might kill me.

555
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,179
Ms. Oh.

556
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,349
Performing surgery instead of someone else is clearly illegal.

557
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,849
I didn't say that I did it.

558
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,260
Anyway, that woman...

559
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,659
When it comes to her son,

560
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm sure she could kill someone.

561
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,090
What is it you want to say?

562
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,329
Tae Oh seems to have some problems.

563
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,030
What?

564
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,199
He had told Do Hyun something strange.

565
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,210
Tae Oh said that someone like Mom wouldn't be able to understand.

566
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,139
If she finds out about this,

567
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,480
she will turn away from me.

568
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,750
So, I said a word to him,

569
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,280
and he even got mad at me.

570
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,820
Hey, Moon Tae Oh!

571
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,288
Had I known he was like this,

572
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:22,360
I wouldn't have let him into the house in the first place.

573
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,730
It's my fault.

574
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,599
You probably couldn't help it either as he's your senior's son.

575
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:33,969
Sorry, Yeong Won.

576
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,239
Tae Oh isn't my senior's son.

577
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,239
- Then? - You don't like...

578
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,079
letting strangers into the house.

579
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,280
I lied to you in order to keep you from worrying.

580
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,849
So, who is he?

581
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,760
I received psychological counseling.

582
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,129
I met him for the first time there.

583
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,428
(Tell me your story. I will always be on your side and listen.)

585
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:07,400
Sir! Doctor!

586
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,709
- No! I'm not it. Save me. Help me. - What?

587
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,308
- I'm not it! - Help!

588
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:12,610
- I'm not it! - Help me!

589
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,109
- We need some help! - I'm not it!

590
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm not it.

591
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,750
No, I'm not it!

592
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,920
Are you okay?

593
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,760
You were surprised, weren't you?

594
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,900
You're Dr. Choi Jae Jin, right?

595
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,440
Yes.

596
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,610
I recognized you at once.

597
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,070
I've always had so much respect for you.

598
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm a medical student.

599
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:50,980
I see.

600
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,750
So, actually...

601
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,159
I was actually like that too.

602
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,130
At first, the fact that he had the same worry as me...

603
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,369
made me feel good and fascinated.

604
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,969
But now that I think about it,

605
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,800
it seems he knew all my secrets.

606
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,739
Are you saying...

607
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,239
he approached you intentionally?

608
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,110
Yes.

609
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,349
He was quite tall.

610
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,550
My head touched his chin.

611
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,889
You know what the trick is...

612
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,860
for this kind of locked-room mystery in detective novels?

613

Hello, Mr. Gu.

615
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,539
I'm still looking into the Yangpyeong fire case.

616
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,710
It seems they will request a warrant right away tomorrow.

617
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,309
A warrant?

618
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,980
This soon?

619
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,619
The evidence is too concrete.

620
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,750
They probably want to hand it over to the prosecution soon.

621
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:07,219
I see.

622
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,329
Look more into Moon Tae Oh.

623
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,099
Okay.

Good job.

Please hang in there a little more.

is in our house.

I'm all right, so take Lee Se Na down first.

634
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,320
It's such an insult...

635
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,690
that she got the best of me.

What?

639
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,980
Did I get promoted?

640

Take good care of the family on my behalf, Dr. No.

to protect our family.

your way of apologizing.

645
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,769
I think I understand you a little now.

Have you seen anyone go in or out of that vacation home?

00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,769
they talked only about my older sister.

670
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,969
It made me so angry,

671
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,039
but I couldn't say a thing.

672
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,639
So for timid revenge,

673
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:26,380
I made a mess of all the family photos at home.

674
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,050
You know what was sadder?

675
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,260
No one noticed it.

676
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,400
It's all right.

677
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,699
Open up and gush everything out.

678
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:48,738
It's important for all of you...

679
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:51,010
to unburden all the resentment deep within your hearts.

680
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,409
This time... You came with him. Why don't you do it?

681
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Go on.

682
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,250
Hello.

683
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,690
I've been eating this here,

684
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,690
but it's never because I'm hungry.

685
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,130
I always feel empty.

686
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Could it be...

687
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,570
because I haven't taken anthelmintics?

688
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,808
Mr. Moon has come with some snacks...

689
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,579
just in time.

690
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,848
Why don't you come over and say hello?

691
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:33,079
Mr. Moon Tae Oh.

692
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,420
Oh, sure.

693
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,800
He's not Moon Tae Oh who goes to the Korea National University.

694
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:49,130
The actual Moon Tae Oh isn't the man we know.

695
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,269
Could he have been at the vacation home that day?

696
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,440
It's strange he approached you at that time.

697
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,039
And the pattern and method are so similar...

698
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,110
to how Lee Se Na intentionally approached you.

699
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,210
Lee Se Na had a distorted idea about my family counseling.

700
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:09,690
I'll check if there's anyone similar in the records of my past patients.

701
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:11,989
So Lee Se Na could be in league with Moon Tae Oh?

702
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,119
I'm sure they're related in a way.

703
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,360
I'll look into that.

704
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,900
Hold on. Does this mean...

705
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,329
even Do Hyun's private lessons were part of Lee Se Na's plan?

706
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,868
It's not certain yet.

707
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:29,000
We don't know if they're acquainted. Let's go for now.

708
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,209
We couldn't find anything about Lee Se Na here.

709
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,209
No. We have to find a boy.

710
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,509
(The 1st half of 2006)

711
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,809
If he approached us with the same purpose,

712
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,880
he must've been a patient in a similar environment.

713
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:42,980
He could've been rejected by his parents or siblings.

714
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,848
(Family medical history: None)

715
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,690
(Others: The mother seemed lethargic in terms of handling family issues.)

716
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:52,260
(Medical Record, Name: Oh Ji Hwan)

717
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,030
(Name: Oh Ji Hwan)

718
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:57,469
He wouldn't listen to me.

719
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,599
He has all his body wrapped in bandages every day.

720
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,539
It seems to be a way of expressing his need for attention.

721
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,349
Is his father not here?

722
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,750
You must've heard that the prior interview was important.

723
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:17,820
He's busy.

724
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,559
When a child shows this kind of behavior,

725
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,130
it means there's a cause within the family.

726
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,329
By any chance,

727
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,639
is there a violence problem within your family?

728
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,239
No.

729
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,138
Ma'am.

730
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,179
("Morning Signal")

731
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:45,809
Enduring is not always the right solution.

732
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:48,079
I want to quit.

733
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:52,489
Dr. No.

734
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:54,920
This won't be aired, right?

735
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,760
It must never.

736
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:57,889
You probably know...

737
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,599
the biggest problem in your family.

738
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,500
You must cut it off.

739
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,570
If parents don't change,

740
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:08,639
their child won't change either.

741
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:15,739
Ra Kyung, do you remember this boy?

742
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,079
"Oh Ji Hwan?"

743
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,750
Oh, him. His father was the problem.

744
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,519
Can you check how Oh Ji Hwan is doing?

745
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:27,260
His eyes were bigger.

746
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,190
- Right. - He had a sharp nose.

747
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,500
- He had glasses on, right? - Yes.

748
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,360
- Hey. - I haven't eaten.

749
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,130
What are you saying? You ate before you came here.

750
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,170
- Here. - No, thanks.

751
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:52,050
That witch worked voluntarily here?

752
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,618
It's Francesca.

753
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,249
- Francesca. - Francesca.

754
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,749
- Hi! - Francesca.

755
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,289
- I missed you. - Francesca.

756
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:03,230
- Thank you. - Thank you.

757
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,389
How ironic.

758
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,530
Hello.

759
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,599
- Hello. - Hello.

760
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,739
I once visited here with Se Na...

761
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,840
I mean, Francesca.

762
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,110
Right.

763
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:25,150
Have you seen Francesca lately?

764
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,280
She stayed here for a few days and left yesterday.

765
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,519
I see.

766
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,449
Could we have a talk for a minute?

767
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,659
Do you know who this is?

768
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,960
It's Francesca.

769
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,429
What... Okay.

770
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:40,900
Is she good to you?

771
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,768
Yes. I love her more than all the others.

772
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:44,829
I see.

773
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,769
She must be really nice.

774
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,538
I like Uncle Thomas more.

775
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:52,869
Uncle Thomas? Who's that?

776
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,820
So this is Uncle Thomas.

777
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,190
Hey,

778
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,420
look at this.

779
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:13,059
Ma'am, do you know who this is?

780
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,960
It's Thomas.

781
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,070
Why do you ask?

782
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:20,469
Was Thomas raised here too?

783
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,000
Yes.

784
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,308
Ma'am, I know you love...

785
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:27,178
everyone in this world.

786
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:28,479
But you have to be careful with this guy. This guy...

787
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,480
Please, Young Min.

788
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,449
What is his real name?

789
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,659
- Hey. - They knew each other.

790
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,929
I also found out Moon Tae Oh's real name.

791
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,199
It's Oh Tae Hwan.

792
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,630
It isn't Oh Ji Hwan?

793
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,369
I'll be there quickly.

794
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,099
Gosh, I'm sorry.

795
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:02,480
It was the older twin.

796
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,710
It wasn't Oh Ji Hwan.

797
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,519
It was Oh Tae Hwan.

798
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,360
(Mr. Park)

799
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:24,729
(There was a suspicious man roaming around the vacation home.)

800
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,130
(Here's the facial composite of that man.)

801
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,840
Who?

802
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:35,538
It was the man you came with once.

803
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:36,849
He was looking for you.

804
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:40,519
Is there something going on, Francesca?

805
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,590
They seemed to know Thomas too.

806
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:48,519
I'll call you back.

807
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:03,170
Look at that face. Gosh, it's legendary.

808
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,368
It's hilarious.

809
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,509
All right.

810
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,840
There we go.

811
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,280
How does it feel to have things go your way?

812
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,789
Well, aren't things a lot more exciting this way?

813
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,259
Exciting?

814
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,260
Yes. Look at this. Look at No Yeong Won's face.

815
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,659
This is much better.

816
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:28,799
No Yeong Won needs to feel the pain...

817
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,329
from her family breaking down too.

818
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,099
You should keep yourself hidden somewhere.

819
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,269
Hong Sa Kang is accused of murder according to your will.

820
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,780
Won't it be dangerous for you?

821
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,139
Why?

822
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,609
No Yeong Won will never think it was me.

823
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,110
She will definitely think it was you.

824
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,750
So?

825
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,449
You're getting ahead of yourself a lot these days.

826
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,090
If it wasn't for me,

827
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,558
you would have never dreamt of revenge.

828
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,889
You know that, don't you?

829
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:06,400
This is what I get for turning a fool into a human being?

830
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,840
We have to reach the end.

831
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:17,980
Don't you think so?

832
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,379
The mother wants to feed her son.

833
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,920
- It's surely a good intention. - Right.

834
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,590
But the son refuses to eat.

835
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,590
Right.

836
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,190
Within the relationships as a couple, parents, and children,

837
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,159
have we considered love...

838
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:43,300
Will you get your revenge by just staring at her?

839
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,150
If you are to get your revenge,

840
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,719
you'll need a new life.

841
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:09,260
This is your new life.

842
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,429
Really?

843
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,869
This is all mine?

844
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,920
You will now be...

845
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,530
born into a new life.

846
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,070
But will things work as we wish?

847
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:53,239
That woman and that household seem pretty tough to deal with.

848
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,400
Fine.

849
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,269
One ticket to Hoengseong.

850
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,380
(Gwangju, Jeonju, Gangneung)

851
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,178
(East Seoul to Hoengseong)

852
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:04,150
(Kyung Soo Express)

853
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,690
You were right.

854
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,719
My mom won't accept me.

855
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,260
Come here and save me.

856
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:27,570
(Tae Oh)

857
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,039
It's Tae Oh.

858
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:36,239
Mom. Won't it be right for me to answer him to completely fool him?

859
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,809
He might find it suspicious and decide not to come.

860
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,209
That can't happen.

861
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,348
You can't be directly involved in this.

862
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,719
Right. Your uncle is right.

863
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:45,989
I'm right?

864
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,559
It's been a really long time since you said I was right.

865
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:52,159
He's someone who believes he has gaslighted Do Hyun.

866
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,960
His curiosity will bring him here.

867
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,800
Right. Let's wait.

868
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,300
This is Gangnam Police Station.

869
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:02,539
Right.

870
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,610
The real culprit?

871
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:08,110
- Yes. Tell me the details. - What is it about?

872
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,909
Right.

873
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:12,809
I asked you what it was about.

874
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,849
The real culprit of the murder case in Yangpyeong's vacation home...

875
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,849
Hello?

876
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:24,460
(Gangdong-gu, Gilgaon-ro 160, Building 2, Room 905)

877
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,029
Follow us.

878
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,530
Get in.

879
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,789
(How will it be if the world knows your family's secrets?)

880
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,059
Hello.

881
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,670
- You're here. - Yes.

882
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:41,670
What about Do Hyun?

883
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,809
You are from Yangju Cathedral's orphanage.

884
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,809
You pretended to be Moon Tae Oh of Korea National University.

885
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,079
You're Oh Ji Hwan's older twin brother,

886
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,119
Oh Tae Hwan.

887
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,090
How long have you known Lee Se Na?

888
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:17,070
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

889
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,499
It's wrong to believe that things went wrong because of me.

890
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,699
That is why...

891
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,808
we want you to crumble.

892
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:52,809
Family?

893
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,079
Stop talking about family!

894
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,379
You've done enough to keep your mouth shut for those people.

895
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,320
You have a weapon with you.

896
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,019
There's no name of the sender.

897
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:06,590
We must catch her before she gets away.

898
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:11,630
You should've listened.

899
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,960
It's time to break free now.
