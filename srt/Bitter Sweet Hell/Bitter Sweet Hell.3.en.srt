00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,849
Dr. Oh!

7
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,310
She's not dead.

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,959
Mother.

9
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,069
It wasn't me.

10
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,439
Then, who?

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
I haven't been here long either.

12
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,680
And when I got here, she was already in this state.

13
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,920
But, Ms. No...

14
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,390
You're not suspecting me, are you?

15
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,459
Let's talk about that later.

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,560
She seems to have hurt her head.

17
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,599
We should get her to a hospital first.

18
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,900
You're calling 911?

19
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,300
Ms. No.

20
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,240
How will you explain this situation?

21
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,840
- Still... - Let's not make a big fuss.

22
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,250
Ms. No, someone the whole country knows.

23
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,419
Will you be able to handle it?

24
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,669
We have to save her life first.

25
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,969
We should take her to Honghak Hospital as it's the closest.

26
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,340
Yes, good thinking.

27
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,080
That's exactly what I was thinking.

28
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,780
Mother, what are you doing?

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,090
- Me? - We have to move her quickly.

30
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,520
Mother, it's the police.

31
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,888
Ms. No. You must remain calm under these circumstances.

Could you open it a little more?

35
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,750
You're Dr. No Yeong Won, right?

36
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,789
- Yes. - Yes, she is.

37
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,829
Yes, you can go.

38
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,899
- Oh, thank you. - Thank you.

Oh, my. Ms. Hong.

48
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,279
What on earth is going on?

49
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,910
Who is this person?

50
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,679
We came here on a trip, but she suddenly got hurt.

51
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,350
It made me so flustered.

52
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,349
Being able to help in this way is such an honor, ma'am.

53
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,860
Gosh, it's not like I expected this when I did a good deed.

54
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,258
Goodness, of course not.

55
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,759
But we did receive such great help from you.

56
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,100
We're always so grateful to you, Ms. Hong.

57
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:03,398
This hospital is still standing firm now,

58
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,300
and it's all thanks to you, ma'am.

59

(Chapter 3: Ghost Lights)

61
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,720
They say it's just a temporary shock.

62
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,189
I'm sure she'll regain consciousness soon.

63
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,959
It's a relief that she doesn't have any internal bleeding.

64
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,100
But concussions could have aftereffects after she wakes up.

65
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,370
Who could have done this to Dr. Oh?

66
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm sure we'll find that out when she wakes up too.

67
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,339
I think it's only right that we report this.

68
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,980
We should find out who did this to Dr. Oh.

69
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:49,949
Mother.

70
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,720
What are you doing?

71
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,589
Jae Jin could have done this.

72
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,430
Jae Jin?

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,259
I said he could have done this.

74
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,829
I didn't say that he did.

75
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,199
Mother, now is not the time for wordplay.

76
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,470
That vacation home...

77
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,670
You remember too, don't you?

78
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,509
You used to come over when you were young.

79
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,339
I heard some time ago that Jae Jin sold that place.

80
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,680
But it turns out that he didn't sell it.

81
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,019
Also, the fact that Dr. Oh was there...

82
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,430
means that this has something to do with Jae Jin.

83
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,230
A downright lie.

84
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,629
Me?

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't you believe me?

86
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,100
I received a text yesterday.

87
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,110
It said, "A downright lie."

88
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,680
Who could have sent such a thing?

89
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,449
But how did you come to the vacation home?

90
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,620
And what about you? How did you come here?

91
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,790
Along with the strange text,

92
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,089
I got a miniature model of the vacation home.

93
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:08,629
Before that, I received a photo of Jae Jin at the vacation home too.

94
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,198
I thought it had something to do with Jae Jin.

95
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,860
I came because I had reasonable doubts.

96
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,629
Oh, I see.

97
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,100
And on top of that,

98
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,839
the medical society Jae Jin attended for a year didn't even exist.

99
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,079
The place he went to every week for that society...

100
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,079
was Yangpyeong, where the vacation home was.

101
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,250
Why would Jae Jin have done that?

102
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,419
Dr. Oh had collapsed there,

103
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,759
and you were there. Of course it looks strange.

104
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,289
What are you saying right now?

105
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,289
Are you saying that Jae Jin had an affair or something?

106
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,729
Don't assume things like that.

107
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,769
Our dear Dr. Choi isn't like that.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,799
Please tell me now. How did you come to the vacation home?

109
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Me?

110
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,169
- I went on a drive. - A drive?

111
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,909
Why? Am I not allowed to go for a drive in my own car?

112
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,049
I was just going for a drive, and I got close to the vacation home.

113
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,250
And the vacation home was still there as it was.

114
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,950
There were even lights on inside.

115
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,549
So, of course, I was curious.

116
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,889
No, Ms. No.

117
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,000
We shouldn't be suspicious among family, should we?

118
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Now, I wonder if this family is what I thought it to be.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,669
Anyway, I have to look into what happened yesterday.

120
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,809
It hasn't even been a day.

121
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,839
You have people to say hello to here,

122
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,110
so you should stay a little longer before you come home.

123
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,250
I'll contact Jae Jin, okay?

124
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,470
(VIP Room)

125
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,039
Is that so much fun?

126
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,710
Dr. No.

127
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,779
Did I tell you...

128
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,090
that my husband was promoted to director?

129
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,759
Without him, that company would not have existed.

130
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,259
The chairman told me that...

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,230
as he held my hand tightly.

132
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,899
You must be happy.

133
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:39,980
My daughter...

134
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,889
Did I tell you that she placed first in her grade again?

135
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,759
There's nothing my daughter can't do.

136
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,428
She has good grades, and she's athletic.

137
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,600
She's such a beauty too.

138
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,870
I see.

139
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,639
But it's no use.

140
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,070
That wench...

141
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,639
has a sharp tongue.

142
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,980
That spiteful wench.

143
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,950
I'm trying to quit smoking.

144
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,750
I see.

145
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Did you check the CCTV cameras? Were any of them on?

146
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,419
They were all off.

147
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,830
- What about Dr. Oh's phone? - Nothing.

148
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,899
- In her car? - Nothing.

149
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,269
Now that Jae Jin can't be reached,

150
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,840
I just can't figure out what happened.

151
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,269
There's something you need to see.

152
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,298
But this is Ms. Hong's workroom.

153
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,399
It's okay.

154
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,340
Stay still.

155
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,269
Sit down.

156
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,240
Don't talk about that woman here.

157
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,049
Goodness. This is crazy.

158
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,759
Give me a notice before you come.

159
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,360
Why? This is my vacation home.

160
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:20,929
Gosh.

161
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,340
Why don't you continue?

162
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,850
I should've burned this whole place back then.

163
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,538
Clear everything away here. Don't leave any traces.

164
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,610
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,679
But over there...

166
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,080
Over there what?

Hello.

Here.

176
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,409
What brought you here, Dr. No?

177
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,479
- Dr. Choi is off today. - I know.

178
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,018
I was nearby, so I decided to buy these for you.

179
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,590
Gosh. Thank you.

180
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,319
Dr. Choi left a text message. He couldn't come today...

181
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,360
because of an urgent colloquium.

182
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,158
But coincidentally, Vice-Director Oh didn't come either.

183
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,299
So we're all over the place today.

184
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,898
Have you tried to reach Dr. Oh?

185
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,230
She wouldn't answer her phone.

186
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,739
Is everything okay with her?

187
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,899
She left work in a rush yesterday.

188
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You should go back to work.

I mean, Dr. Choi?

195

I have some business with him today.

So, why did you come here?

198
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,609
Of course, I came to see Jae Jin.

We're closer than you think we are.

200

that people do when they tell a lie.

Psychologically speaking...

Well, there's no need to take it that far.

207
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,078
You know when I was in college,

208
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,279
I gave investigative consultations as a part-time job.

- Yes. - You...

210
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,118
said you needed money.

211
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,789
- What? - No?

212
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,420
Yes, I do. I need money.

213
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,129
This is great thinking, Yeong Won.

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,049
Right. I met him to borrow some money.

221
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,019
Brother-in-law. You startled me.

222
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,490
- Hi. - Hey.

223
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,730
What brought you here without prior notice?

224
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,729
Prior notice? We can do that to each other.

225

And "Brother-in-law?" Just call me Young Min.

226
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:54,639
I came because of this brilliant business idea.

227
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,069
Well, Young Min.

228
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,838
I have urgent business right now.

229
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,879
Let's talk another time.

230
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,849
Is it very urgent? Where are you going?

231
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,179
I have a colloquium.

232
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,879
I'm running late. Let's talk later.

233
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,288
He rushed out, saying he had a colloquium to go.

234
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,420
This is not good.

235
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,220
All right.

236
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,689
Let's talk on the way.

237
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,629
Young Min. I said we should do it another time.

238
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,599
I'll get off on the way.

239
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,729
You said you were urgent. Move.

240
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,000
- But... - It won't take long.

241
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,410
This is what I'm talking about.

242
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,578
I told my sister,

243
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:35,750
but you know how inflexible she is. She didn't even listen.

244
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,609
Speaking of which,

245
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,289
I need just 20,000 dollars.

246
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,419
You have that much money, don't you?

247
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,759
Well, right.

248
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,890
Yes? Or no?

249
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:53,429

250

00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,940
Well...

254
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,578
- In Yangpyeong? - Yes.

255
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,339

Gosh, my phone.

259
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,430
But he didn't answer my phone when it must've buzzed.

You've never seen him? But why?

267
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,229
See? This shows your indifference toward me.

268
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,730
It was the same in the past. No one cared about me.

269
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,328
Even Mom and Dad always talked about you to others.

270
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,328
No one bothered to talk about me.

That's all.

274
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,980
So? When can you get the money ready?

275
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,250
What money?

276
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,649
What? I just told you everything because you said you'd pay me.

277

You should've chased him to the end.

278

How can I pay you when you brought me nothing?

279

00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,558
The phone is turned off.

334
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,730
Please leave a message after the tone.

335
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,068
Your call may be charged after the tone.

336
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,170
Oh, son.

337
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,500
You need to answer my call at least.

338
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,069
Mother.

339
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,349
Ms. No.

340
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,018
Don't you know how to knock?

341
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,250
Why did you clean it?

342
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,849
What are you saying? Speak English.

343
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,618
The cottage.

344
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,059
Why did you go there again?

345
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,288
It's a crime scene, Mother.

346
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,528
Are you expecting me to leave everything as it is?

347
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,900
It'll permeate into the floor.

348
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,259
My goodness.

349
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,900
By the way, we need to find Dr. Oh's phone.

350
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,199
She's still the vice director of the hospital.

351
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,869
We need to let the hospital know at least.

352
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,279
You mean this?

353
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:56,809
Oh, Lord.

354
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,789
You, Dr. Oh, and Jae Jin.

355
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,220
You've known each other for a long time.

356
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,460
Why did you hide it from me?

357
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,259
What do you mean? What did I hide?

358
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,569
You never asked.

359
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,109
Are you doubting the relationship between the two?

360
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,210
No.

361
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:30,779
No.

362
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,118
Those two...

363
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,089
are not in a relationship like you think. Never.

364
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,890
It's just that Dr. Oh became an orphan when she was young,

365
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,490
and my family happened to sponsor her.

366
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,899
What can I do about the fact...

367
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,670
that she has a crush on Jae Jin?

368
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,740
We have to admit that Jae Jin is good-looking.

369
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,509
"Sorry about the late reply."

370
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,079
"I am..."

371
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,480
"on vacation for a while."

372
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,949
"I've told Director Choi already,"

373
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,519
"but it seems it wasn't passed down."

374
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,500
It's strange if the vice director can't be reached for this long.

375
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,329
How wicked.

376
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,369
How dare she eye Jae Jin?

377
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
(Move this picture to the Recycling Bin?)

378
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,639
You can't just delete the pictures on her phone.

379
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,579
What? It's my son's picture.

380
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,309
Mother!

381
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,369
(Delusion)

382
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,710
(Son, good night, and I'll see you in the morning. I love you.)

383
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:27,088
Mr. Park, have you found anything?

384
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,089
(Soft Hands)

385
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,160
There's something you need to check urgently.

386
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,000
Which is?

387
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,900
I found a video that captured Dr. Choi that night.

388
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,200
You mean Jae Jin?

389
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,799
Yes.

390
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,299
I'll send it to you right away.

391
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:56,349
(Juicy Fruit)

392
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,269
(A downright lie)

393
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,210
Tuesday.

394
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,108
(December 4, Tuesday)

395
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,149
(Did you finish up the surgery well? Want to have dinner today?)

396
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,180
(Sorry, I'm tired today. Let's eat together next time.)

397
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,289
If it wasn't Dr. Oh,

398
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,220
who was he with?

399
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,578
(Soft Hands)

400
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,180
(Closed)

401
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,819
Hey, does this have chunks in it because it was made by hand?

402
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,390
Anyway, you're doing errands for your uncle?

403
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,088
You punk, you're more family-oriented than I thought.

404
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,130
I can't refuse to do Uncle's errands.

405
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,029
My uncle provided for my whole family.

406
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:18,269
My uncle is the most successful person in my family.

407
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:23,539
Your uncle who runs a corn guksu place is the most successful?

408
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:26,939
Well, this is just something he does as a hobby after retiring.

409
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,109
What is this errand?

410
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,650
He told me not to tell.

411
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,848
You're more tight-lipped than I thought, punk.

412
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,150
My uncle's lips are even tighter.

413
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,420
He's the most tight-lipped person in my whole family.

414
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,459
Even during the presidential election,

415
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,059
he wouldn't say who he voted for.

416
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,730
Even to his family.

417
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,959
That's harsh. My sister is like that too.

418
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,500
Anyway, just stuff your face and leave soon.

419
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,868
I have to let this dough rest before I go.

420
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,299
I'm in a very busy state.

421
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,900
You punk.

422
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,170
Hey.

423
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:00,609
I have just made a big deal with my brother-in-law,

424
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:03,950
and I will only focus on my business from now on.

425
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:08,150
Why? Is your brother-in-law giving you money?

426
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,389
What about me?

427
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,519
Hey, Seung Jae.

428
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:18,229
How much longer will you work at your uncle's guksu place,

429
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,829
kneading dough and running errands?

430
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,300
You should also have a corn guksu place of your own.

431
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,869
Me?

432
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,369
Would I be able to do it?

433
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,109
Hey, don't you remember when we were in the military?

434
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,239
Have you forgotten everything?

435
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,309
We had passion.

436
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:37,948
- Passion. - Passion.

437
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,949
Bring it in!

438
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
- Go! - Go!

439
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,800
Let's eat.

440
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,070
Where's Dad?

441
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,238
Didn't you tell him that Dr. Choi went to a colloquium?

442
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,109
Oh, Dad went to a colloquium.

443
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,179
When is he coming back?

444
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,610
- Soon. - After a while.

445
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,420
You know, Do Hyun...

446
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,590
Idols go on world tours, right?

447
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,820
Dad was invited by several colloquia.

448
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,690
So, shall we say he went on tour?

449
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,900
But then, why is his phone turned off?

450
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,899
He must be busy.

451
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,170
I talked to him.

452
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:38,269
I guess my grandson was a daddy's boy.

453
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,979
It's not like that.

454
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,610
I was just bored without Dad.

455
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,460
Gosh, what is this? Isn't this a hidden camera?

456
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,889
What happened?

457
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,789
There was a hidden camera in the men's restroom.

458
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,459
A hidden camera?

459
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,599
There was one in the men's changing room too.

460
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,129
And another one was found in the Director's room.

461
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,670
Even in the Director's room?

462
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,639
But is Director Choi not here?

463
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,979
He was so shocked.

464
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,909
He's getting some rest now.

465
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:19,249
Right. It just so happens that the Vice-Director is on vacation today.

466
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,280
Darn it!

467
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,389
How could there be a hidden camera at a hospital?

468
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,690
How ridiculous is that?

469
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,529
He found the hidden camera in the men's restroom.

470
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,658
Oh, I see. You must have been surprised.

471
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:34,759
Are you all right?

472
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,569
Oh, well, what can we do to compensate you?

473
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,570
How about monetary compensation?

474
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,170
Compensation is one thing, but we should take action first.

475
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,710
Have you reported it?

476
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,250
Forget about that!

477
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,379
What I want is for this hospital to shut down.

478
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,718
I will not tolerate this hospital continuing to treat patients...

479
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,320
after this debacle.

480
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:01,859
But sir, we didn't do that...

481
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,488
Please calm down first.

482
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,729
Well... As our patient...

483
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,558
and the person who reported the crime,

484
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,170
we will follow your opinion, no questions asked.

485
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
What?

486
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,139
Are you sure? Then,

487
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,210
I'll trust you to it and leave.

488
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,110
However!

489
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,809
I will be sure to check...

490
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,780
whether you really shut down or not. Got it?

491
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,518
Are you saying you'll shut down the hospital?

492
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,389
Since things have come to this,

493
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:35,960
we should change the hospital's name too.

494
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:39,360
Let's freshen the place up with some remodeling work.

495
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:40,960
Remodeling work?

496
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,969
Yes, just think of it as a month of paid vacation.

497
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,170
- What? A vacation? - Now?

498
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Right now.

499
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,170
- Thank you! - Thank you!

500
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,269
Go on.

501
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:06,559
It was you, wasn't it?

502
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:09,530
What was?

503
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,730
If not, we should catch the culprit.

504
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
This time, I'm really going to report it.

505
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,070
Come on, Ms. No. Were you always this righteous?

506
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,570
Why do you keep saying you'll report every little thing?

507
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,018
The director and vice-director of the hospital have disappeared.

508
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,019
Then, what should we do?

509
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,589
It would look suspicious to anyone.

510
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,659
Still, you're willing to shut down the hospital like this?

511
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,360
Remodeling the place because of hidden cameras is more suspicious.

512
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,839
You just seem to be getting better at making harsh comments.

513
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,400
You turned this into an even bigger issue.

514
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,039
Are you trying to fool me again?

515
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,539
Again? What else did I do?

516
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,679
What on earth is it you're hiding from me?

517
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,250
You said...

518
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:13,519
that you got a strange text message one day, right?

519
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,218
Yes.

520
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,859
This is the message that I got on the 49th day...

521
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,500
after Prosecutor Choi passed away.

522
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:25,230
(How would it feel if the husband you wanted dead disappeared?)

523
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:29,368
It must be the person who wrote that Prosecutor Choi's death...

524
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,239
has to do with my novel.

525
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,909
It was exactly the same as the story in your novel.

526
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,219
Do you still suspect me?

527
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,760
Actually, a strange parcel arrived before that too.

528
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,860
It was a family photo and a stuffed pigeon doll.

529
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,760
Was its head cut off?

530
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,199
Yes. That's right.

531
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,869
Well, it's an obvious cliche.

532
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,538
An obvious cliche just like saying that I killed Prosecutor Choi...

533
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,480
in the same way as in my novel.

534
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,159
Do you want to take a look?

535
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:34,269
(101N 9999)

536
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,610
No way. Did Jae Jin?

537
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,719
No.

538
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,889
You know, Ms. No.

539
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,260
Our dear Jae Jin is not that kind of person.

540
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,820
I don't know...

541
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,030
what kind of person Jae Jin is.

542
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,929
Do you still not get it? We've been set in a trap.

543
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:06,969
A trap?

544
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,939
Who is it then? Who set this trap for us?

545
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,079
Well, that's...

546
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,409
How would I know all that? I don't know that either.

547
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,980
But what is certain...

548
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,849
is that we've fallen into a trap. So,

549
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,219
we have to figure it out together.

550
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,029
(J Plastic and Reconstruction Surgery Center)

551
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,800
Well... Who are you?

552
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,929
Oh, you're Director Choi's wife and mother, right?

553
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,099
I've heard about it outside.

554
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,199
I'm Gu Kyung Tae.

555
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:46,538
I'm the vice-director's... Dr. Oh Ji Eun's...

556
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,639
boyfriend.

557
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,579
Oh, and what brings you here?

558
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,349
Ji Eun has...

559
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,559
disappeared.

560
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,329
I'm aware that Dr. Oh is on vacation at the moment.

561
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,030
All of a sudden?

562
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:14,269
That can't be.

563
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,610
She just notified it to the group chat at that?

564
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,579
She wouldn't even answer her phone?

565
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,139
Goodness.

566
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,880
That's definitely not like my Ji Eun.

567
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:26,749
Dr. Oh isn't a little child.

568
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,179
She probably has her reasons.

569
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,349
No!

570
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,860
Something definitely happened!

571
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,059
- What... - Gosh.

572
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,289
Mr. Gu Kyung Tae, right?

573
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,860
Calm down a little first.

574
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,530
Wait. You're Dr. No Yeong Won.

575
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,369
Well... That's right.

576
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,110
Dr. No. My Ji Eun's behavior.

577
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:53,980
What does it indicate about her mental state?

578
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,909
What should I do now?

579
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,050
Well...

580
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,420
Mr. Gu,

581
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,960
why do you think Dr. Oh got into an accident...

582
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,690
just because you can't reach her?

583
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,659
Because it's the last thing that would happen.

584
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,629
And she shouldn't.

585
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,969
Are you perhaps afraid it might mean she has left you...

586
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:19,539
now that she won't answer her phone? Is that why?

587
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,769
Of course, love is accompanied...

588
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,769
by a sense of anxiety.

589
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,679
- But... - It isn't...

590
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,150
just my assumption.

591
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:32,150
Every circumstance...

592
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,119
implies that something happened with my Ji Eun.

593
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:37,219
Circumstance...

594
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:42,619
Tell me. Are you a detective or something?

595
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,360
The truth is...

596
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,199
I'm with the police.

597
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,639
The police...

598
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,300
Just to be...

599
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,539
a public official,

600
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,979
I studied hard enough to have nosebleeds...

601
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,449
for as long as 15 years.

602
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,280
And my gut feeling says...

603
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,150
that something...

604
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:10,989
is fishy.

605
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,718
After the third day, I can report her missing...

606
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,329
and track her phone too.

607
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,760
Wait and see.

608
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:21,159
I'll reveal the truth behind this case...

609
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:24,429
and make sure...

610
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,800
to find my Ji Eun.

611
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,550
Mother. Why did you have to provoke him?

612
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,650
That's not important right now.

613
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:40,579
We have a variable.

614
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,789
Dong Tae, Myung Tae, or whatever his name is,

615
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,219
Dr. Oh's boyfriend is a cop.

616
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,789
It's Kyung Tae.

617
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,029
He became a police officer after 15 years of studying.

618
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,329
Constable Gu Kyung Tae.

619
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,729
Right. Constable Gu Kyung Tae...

620
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,940
who became a police officer after 15 years of studying.

621
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,969
Oh, right!

622
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:05,769
We have to take care of Dr. Oh's phone.

623
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,119
Do you know the passcode?

624
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,750
I, Hong Sa Kang, am the Korean Agatha Christie.

625
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,780
One-three-five-zero-star.

626
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:46,579
How dare she... It's Jae Jin's birthdate.

627
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,590
Dr. No.

628
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,590
Let's take some of her clothes and stuff in the luggage.

629
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,420
It should seem like she's actually on a trip.

630
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,760
Oh, right.

631
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,730
Her phone...

632
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,170
Let's put it around here.

633
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,070
Now even if he tracks her phone, it will come out to be here.

634
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,469
Then, he'll have no other way...

635
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,980
to find her whereabouts.

636
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,409
You have a knack for hiding stuff.

637
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,219
Is she trying to sock it to me?

638
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:06,519
My Ji Eun...

639
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,269
Goodness.

640
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,070
Gosh.

641
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,079
Gosh, Ji Eun...

642
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,150
Ji Eun...

643
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:39,860
I'll be good to you.

644
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:41,860
Ji Eun.

645
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,030
Ji Eun!

646
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,860
Goodness. Ji Eun.

647
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,159
Where did you go?

648
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,730
Darn it.

649
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,610
Who are you?

650
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,710
Excuse me!

651
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:34,440
What do you think you're doing?

652
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,510
Who are you?

653
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,050
I'm Dr. Oh's...

654
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:46,420
I mean, Ji Eun's uncle.

655
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:50,360
And who are you?

656
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:54,099
I'm Ji Eun's boyfriend, Gu Kyung Tae.

657
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,500
Her boyfriend?

658
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,969
Are you here because you couldn't reach Ji Eun?

659
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,599
- Reach her? - Yes.

660
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:06,239
Check your phone.

661
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,808
(Madam Hong Sa Kang)

662
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,480
Dr. Oh is on vacation.

663
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,280
Well, you...

664
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,090
must be mistaken.

665
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,789
Ji Eun went on a trip.

666
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,159
She texted me.

667
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,519
- Here. - What...

668
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,059
- Really? - Yes.

669
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,429
No. Something's strange.

670
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,630
Wait.

671
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,300
Gosh.

672
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,839
Somebody could've used Ji Eun's phone...

673
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,380
to text you.

674
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,849
It's a common method in missing person cases.

675
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,079
A missing case?

676
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,119
The truth is, I'm a police officer.

677
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,719
(Gu Kyung Tae, National Police Agency)

678
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,690
It's strange that her phone turned off all of a sudden.

679
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,199
And to say she went on a trip,

680
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,170
her luggage is right there.

681
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,099
Something's...

682
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,739
(My Ji Eun)

683
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:15,909
(Kyung Tae)

684
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,980
What? I'm hearing the buzz.

685
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,949
Where...

686
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,550
Where is it?

687
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,880
So what if you're her boyfriend?

688
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,179
I can never...

689
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,480
tolerate this behavior.

690
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:56,050
Gosh. What behavior?

691
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,118
- Goodness! It's her phone. - What?

692
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,219
It's Ji Eun's phone.

693
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,800
Why is her phone here?

694
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,030
I get it.

695
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:11,269
She probably left her phone behind.

696
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,170
Why don't we go outside...

697
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,638
and talk over some warm tea?

698
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,079
- Wait. Her phone... - Come on.

699
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,909
- Let go... - What kind of food do you like?

700
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,848
- Sushi. - Oh, sushi?

701
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,010
Wait a second.

702
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,159
Good work, Do Hyun.

703
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,460
You were quite fast.

704
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,230
You still can't reach your dad?

705
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:45,730
No... It's turned off.

706
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:51,110
Do you think you know everything about your dad?

707
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,840
What defines knowing everything about someone?

708
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,179
I guess you're right. It's hard to define that.

709
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:01,219
Tell me what you think, Do Hyun.

710
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,489
What do you think about your family?

711
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,230
Grandma and Mom's work?

712
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,489
Work?

713
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,199
I'll get going now.

714
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,969
- Are you going to your academy? - I don't want to go.

715
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,170
- But following my schedule... - That's what your Mom likes?

716
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,280
Do Hyun.

717
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,679
It was also the same for me back then.

718
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,079
But this is what I think.

719
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:40,659
The choice is yours to make.

720
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,719
That was what your Mom said too.

721
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,559
Then shall we play another round?

722
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,199
Sounds great. Breaking the rules.

723
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,768
But if my mom calls,

724
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:54,340
you will tell her we studied together, right?

725
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:55,739
Come on, Do Hyun.

726
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,909
You think too much.

727
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:01,440
Let's go.

728
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,889
My gosh! Who are you?

729
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,659
Ms. Hong Sa Kang and Dr. No Yeong Won.

730
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Correct?

731
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:22,929
Who are you?

732
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,939
I have received a request from Prosecutor Choi.

733
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,199
(Private Investigator, Jung Doo Man)

734
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:30,039
A private investigator?

735
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,869
We're usually known as private detectives.

736
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:41,579
Prosecutor Choi asked you for help?

737
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,619
Yes. I served him when I was younger too.

738
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,389
I didn't expect him to go so easily like this.

739
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:53,829
I did pay my respect with condolence money.

740
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,630
What did he ask for help with?

741
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,869
He gave me a call one day and asked me to investigate someone.

742
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,769
Who?

743
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,710
Lee Se Na?

744
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,420
Who is she? Do you know her?

745
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:17,750
She was my patient.

746
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,760
But why did she want you to investigate on her?

747
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,849
I have a lot of photos.

748
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,489
That was why they were at the vacation home together?

749
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,929
What are you doing?

750
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,769
Are you saying Dr. Choi has had an affair?

751
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:09,199
Yes. Lee Se Na is Dr. Choi's secret mistress.

752
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:16,010
Prosecutor Choi worried about Dr. No when he was alive.

753
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,250
That is why he conducted a secret investigation into his son.

754
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,550
Prosecutor Choi felt something was off.

755
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:26,348
He was able to solve cases with his intuition.

756
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,119
And his intuition proved to be right again this time.

757
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,329
This is what I found out about Lee Se Na.

758
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:37,400
She's a witch, I tell you.

759
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:40,269
A witch?

760
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:43,038
Are we in the Middle Ages or something?

761
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:44,110
All have died.

762
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,440
All men who were related to her have died.

763
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:53,209
Two weddings and three funerals.

764
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,480
She experienced all of them.

765
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,719
What?

766
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,119
So all of her husbands have died?

767
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,389
Yes.

768
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,158
They say things happen by chance in this world.

769
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,460
But could you find this to be this ridiculously accidental?

770
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,659
So...

771
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,400
what do you mean by the 2 weddings and 3 funerals?

772
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:17,909
I will tell you...

773
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:20,679
how she started being called a witch.

774
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,210
Oh, to be exact,

775
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,679
she is the Whistling Witch.

776
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:30,150
- "Whistling?" - Yes.

777
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,619
The Whistling Witch.

778
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,320
She always whistled...

779
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,090
whenever a man died.

780
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:39,989
It happened every time.

781
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,969
The cause of death of the first husband was poisoning.

782
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,429
It was from the poison of a pufferfish.

783
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,210
He was poisoned to death?

784
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,709
It concluded as an accidental death,

785
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,840
but it was true that the fish had poison in it.

786
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,249
We do not know if it was accidental or deliberate,

787
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,349
but the important thing is that...

788
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:03,218
Lee Se Na earned...

789
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:05,590
a great amount of insurance money for the death of her first husband.

790
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,090
And that was when...

791
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,230
that rumor started.

792
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,130
It sounded like she was crying,

793
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,739
but she was actually whistling.

794
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,969
The cause of death of her second husband was drowning.

795
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,420
Lee Se Na once again...

796
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,050
earned a great amount of insurance money.

797
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,590
This would've been enough for her to be sick of men.

798
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,460
She didn't get married to the third man.

799
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,429
That man died too?

800
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,070
He burned to death.

801
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,868
It concluded as an accident for him as well,

802
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:59,170
but we do not know if he was burned to death deliberately.

803
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:00,940
The important thing is that...

804
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,078
the recipient of the third man's insurance money...

805
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,280
was Lee Se Na again.

806
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:07,750
Then...

807
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:10,250
are you saying these were murders for their insurance money?

808
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,019
Oh, Lord.

809
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,489
There can't be a conclusion without any positive evidence.

810
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,429
But with 2 weddings and 3 funerals,

811
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,929
I'm quite certain she is a witch.

812
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:24,500
That disgusting woman.

813
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:29,638
I should've taken care of her...

814
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:31,110
before things came this far.

815
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,239
What is that about?

816
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:39,908
Are you saying you knew about this too?

817
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,550
Madam Hong wouldn't have known how dangerous she was.

818
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,150
Only Prosecutor Choi...

819
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,960
had a hunch that Lee Se Na was a dangerous person.

820
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:52,530
Things might not end here.

821
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:59,400
Dr. Choi Jae Jin could be in danger too.

822
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,539
The fourth funeral...

823
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,769
might be coming upon us.

824
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,800
Since when did you know about this?

825
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,469
How dare she take away my son?

826
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,868
You knew about the two of them.

827
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:35,739
Is that why you came to the vacation home that day?

828
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,308
Out of all the men out there,

829
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:40,979
how could she take my innocent Dr. Choi?

830
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,038
Please answer me, Mother!

831
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,880
What has that innocent one done wrong?

832
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,480
Oh, Lord.

833
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,920
Please save your innocent young lamb.

834
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:52,989
Mother!

835
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,389
Dr. No.

836
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,690
I guess I've been too careless.

837
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,460
No.

838
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:03,630
I should report this to the police first.

839
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,340
What if you do?

840
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:11,039
How are you going to describe this to them?

841
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,880
No Yeong Won's husband ran away after having an affair?

842
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,809
Are you trying to let the whole world know about that?

843
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,509
He just said my Jae Jin is with the witch.

844
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,750
Aren't you even worried about him?

845
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:23,280
What will do you if he really dies?

846
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,489
Listen, Mother.

847
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,319
I feel more anger toward the man...

848
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,760
that has fallen into a woman like her.

849
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,989
That's not it.

850
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,789
My Jae Jin is an innocent one.

851
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,599
He was fooled by her because of his innocence.

852
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:38,299
Right. He was so innocent to have kept this a secret from me...

853
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,429
for a whole year.

854
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:40,900
But Mother,

855
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,698
I can't lose everything I've achieved...

856
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,610
because of a man like him.

857
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,480
So what are you going to do?

858
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,309
I will find him.

859
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,750
Won't it be better for him...

860
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,949
to be killed by me instead of the witch?

861
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,329
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

862
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:42,759
We're on the same team now.

863
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,598
Shouldn't we find Jae Jin together?

864
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,670
This is what you call absurd.

865
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:49,699
Hello.

866
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,369
- Dessert first, please. - Darn it!

867
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,480
You're the wife of someone too.

868
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,449
What has that innocent one done wrong?

869
01:02:57,949 --> 01:02:58,949
Oh, Lord.

870
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,979
Protecting your son no matter what doesn't make any sense at all.

871
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,590
The heart of a mother is truly beautiful and sad.

872
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,559
Everyone will die. Everyone!

873
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,989
Do you still not get it?

874
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,230
We've been set in a trap.
