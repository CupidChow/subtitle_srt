Lee Se Na is Dr. Choi's secret mistress.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,120
This is what I found out about Lee Se Na.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,629
She's a witch.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,429
A witch?

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,760
Yes.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,329
The cause of death of the first husband was poisoning.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,829
It was from the poison of a pufferfish.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,100
It was true that fish had poison in it.

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,070
But the important thing is that...

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,139
Lee Se Na earned...

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,409
a great amount of insurance money for the death of her first husband.

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,479
The cause of death of her second husband was drowning.

17
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,678
Lee Se Na once again...

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,990
earned a great amount of insurance money.

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,090
This would've been enough for her to be sick of men.

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,060
She didn't get married to the third man.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,229
It concluded as an accident for him as well,

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,859
The important thing is that...

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,429
the recipient of the third man's insurance money...

24
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,939
was Lee Se Na again.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,340
That disgusting woman.

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,969
I should've taken care of her...

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,909
before things came this far.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,079
What is that about?

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,280
Are you saying you knew about this too?

30
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,989
Since when did you know about this?

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,760
How dare she take away my son?

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,529
You knew about the two of them.

33
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,669
Is that why you came to the vacation home that day?

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,040
Out of all the men out there,

35
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,739
how could she take my innocent Dr. Choi?

36
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,938
Please answer me, Mother!

37
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,780
What has that innocent one done wrong?

38
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,879
Oh, Lord.

39
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,420
I guess I've been too careless.

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,819
No. I should report this to the police first.

41
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,489
What if you do?

42
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,959
How are you going to describe this to them?

43
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,890
No Yeong Won's husband ran away after having an affair?

44
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,929
Are you trying to let the whole world know about that?

45
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,199
He just said my Jae Jin is with the witch.

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,729
Aren't you even worried about him?

47
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,270
What will you do if he really dies?

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,439
Listen, Mother.

49
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,468
I feel more anger toward the man...

50
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,938
that has fallen into a woman like her.

51
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:17,979
That's not it.

52
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,849
My Jae Jin is an innocent one.

53
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,580
He was fooled by her because of his innocence.

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,919
Right.

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,188
He was so innocent to have kept this a secret from me...

56
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,419
for a whole year.

57
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,619
But Mother, I can't lose everything I've achieved...

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,389
because of a man like him.

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,360
So what are you going to do?

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,270
I will find him.

61
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,740
Won't it be better for him...

62
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,840
to be killed by me instead of the witch?

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
The fact that they fooled me for such a long time...

64
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,620
is what I can't tolerate the most.

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,319
I seriously had a raging fire inside me...

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,559
that I even took psychiatric medication.

but I don't think I can because of the children.

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Dr. No, today's story is also very frustrating.

71
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,598
The husband had had another family...

72
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,310
behind the wife's back for a long time,

73
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,810
but even her mother-in-law had known about this fact.

74
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,680
And for 15 long years, at that.

75

77
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,090

85
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,270

But you can't give up.

87
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,750
This issue is clearly the fault of the husband.

88
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,150
Also, the mother-in-law can't do that either.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,860
She's someone's wife too.

90
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,560

don't you ever blame yourself.

96

And don't tell yourself to just endure it...

97
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,220
and torment yourself.

98
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,050
Divorce?

99
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,550
No.

100
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,290
You should be fully compensated...

101
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,189

Your comments today were so feisty.

107
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,910
I guess your husband would be too scared to have an affair.

108

Am I scary?

109

111
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,959
you have some sort of bad spirit stuck on you.

112

I don't know that either.

If you're a courier, someone must've sent this.

Then, did you see the person's face?

I did, but he was just a regular looking man.

Yes, a regular, average man.

Wait, was it a woman?

154
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,509
He wore a black hat and a black mask.

168
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,408
Well... The thing is...

169
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,580
He's at a colloquium.

170
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,490
(Statement)

171
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,659
The culprit behind the hidden cameras has been caught?

172
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:45,919
Yes.

173
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,090
You can have the culprit punished 100 percent,

174
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,860
but that would depend on whether or not...

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,299
you show mercy.

176
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,669
What would you like to do?

177
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,269
Would you like to see?

178
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,799
Yes.

179
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,950
Mother, you're not going to talk about Jae Jin, are you?

180
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,320
I made it clear you can't report it.

181
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,989
Hidden cameras have been found,

182
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,149
but neither the director nor the vice-director has shown up.

183
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,960
Isn't that a bit strange?

184
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,059
It is strange.

185
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,899
That by coincidence, this kind of incident broke out...

186
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,500
while both the director and the vice director were away.

187
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,440
Exactly.

188
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,879
Hardly anything in this world works out as planned.

189
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,179
Right.

190
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,720
Goodness. But I have...

191
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,690
this strange feeling...

192
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,389
that somebody planned it.

193
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,980
Park Seung Jae, 35 years old this year.

194
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,979
- Right? - Yes.

195
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
What's your job?

196
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:23,219
I make corn guksu at a corn guksu place.

197
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,589
You make guksu at a guksu place...

198
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,159
No. I make "corn" guksu...

199
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:31,398
at a "corn" guksu place.

200
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,529
Corn guksu?

201
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:34,629
What's that?

202
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,428
Is it different from janchi guksu?

203
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,269
Yes. It's different from janchi guksu.

204
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,039
Corn guksu is yellow.

205
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,739
Yes, my military colleague.

206
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,179
Park Seung Jae who makes corn guksu at a corn guksu place.

207
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,080
Anyway,

208
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,820
why did you install those secret cameras?

209
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,849
In the men's changing room,

210
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,250
the men's bathroom, and even the director's office.

211
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,490
- The thing is... - Was it someone's order?

212
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,659
Be honest.

213
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,139
I loved the director!

214
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,609
What? Out of the blue?

215
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,610
Yes, out of the blue... No.

216
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:24,919
I had a crush on him for a long time.

217
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,919
But he didn't accept my feelings.

218
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,149
That's ridiculous!

219
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,820
Actually, it's not entirely ridiculous.

220
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,629
It feels like this punk is hiding something.

221
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,070
Well...

222
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,539
I'll show mercy and forgive you.

223
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
- What? - Out of the blue?

224
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,320
It's a famous saying from "Les Miserables."

225
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,990
"To love another person is..."

226
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,429
"to see the face of a deity."

227
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,000
Out of the blue?

228
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,039
Mr. Park Seung Jae who makes corn guksu at a corn guksu place.

229
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,210
Yes.

230
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,139
I forgive you.

231
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,110
So please give up on Dr. Choi now.

232
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,549
Thank you.

233
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,320
Then, should we release him right away?

234
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,559
Yes. Please close the case.

235
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,559
Let's go, Mother.

236
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,200
Anyway, where did the director...

237
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,570
go for this colloquium?

238
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,470
It has nothing to do with this case.

239
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:55,940
Shall we?

240
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,850
(Seoul Gangnam Police Station)

241
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,589
How did you know that man to give him this job?

242
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,089
(Seoul Gangnam Police Station)

243
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,860
You have too many questions. That's not important right now.

244
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,388
I get that you're angry because I stopped you from reporting.

245
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,189
But Jae Jin isn't a little child.

246
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,129
They wouldn't even accept it even if we reported him missing.

247
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,970
You must be so happy to be smart.

248
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,740
Dear son, are you watching this?

249
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,340
Your mother is the only one who worries about you.

250
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,408
Mother. I also...

251
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,840
You what? I'll find my son on my own.

252
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:55,970
Mr. Gu.

253
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,440
Well...

254
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,070
You seem mentally vulnerable right now.

255
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,980
Visit me in my clinic.

256
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,610
I'll do you a counseling.

257
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,690
(Director No Yeong Won)

258
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,590
I'm all right.

259
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,570
I made it with freshly-made noodles.

260
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,870
Was it really necessary?

261
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,980
Noodles are chewier that way.

262
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,480
No, not that.

263
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:42,909
I didn't expect...

264
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,048
that my nephew would say that he loved Dr. Choi.

265
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,990
No, not that.

266
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,389
Did it have to be secret cameras?

267
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:53,820
Well...

268
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,529
It was a means to close the clinic without anyone getting hurt.

269
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,570
At least, your nephew could hold his tongue.

270
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,809
Please have some guksu now.

271
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,110
No.

272
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,980
I have no time for this.

273
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,889
I'm not even allowed to make a report,

274
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,490
so I need to find him much sooner.

275
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,690
I've been checking the security cameras in Yangpyeong.

276
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,830
But there's too much footage to go through.

277
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,740
Gu Kyung Tae...

278
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,639
Visit Gu Kyung Tae.

279
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,710
Gu Kyung Tae? You mean Dr. Oh's boyfriend...

280
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,950
who became a police officer after 15 years of studying?

281
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,220
Sometimes,

282
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,419
I hate myself.

283
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,129
Sometimes,

284
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,599
I cry alone.

285
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,069
Why do you hate yourself?

286
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,470
Can you tell me...

287
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,170
when that happens?

288
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,609
When there's nothing I can do.

289
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,349
Like now.

290
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,950
I can't find my Ji Eun.

291
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,559
The truth is, I found Ji Eun's phone...

292
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,730
at her place.

293
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,230
On her phone,

294
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,069
I found Choi Jae Jin's photos.

295
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:58,250
Mr. Gu, let me be honest with you.

296
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,890
My husband, Choi Jae Jin,

297
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,960
isn't on a business trip. He disappeared.

298
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,390
What? Your...

299
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,900
Your husband can't be reached either?

300
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:16,829
No.

301
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,839
Both the director and vice-director disappeared.

302
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,140
Isn't it strange?

303
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,670
See?

304
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,980
I said it was strange.

305
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,380
Then,

306
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,990
could it be that the two of them...

307
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,690
No.

308
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,190
That must not be true.

309
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,559
I can't be sure about that yet.

310
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,430
But it's certain that they both disappeared.

311
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,170
I can't tell anyone else about this.

312
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,799
But Mr. Gu,

313
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,210
you're a police officer.

314
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,179
You became a police officer...

315
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,680
after 15 years of studying without giving up.

316
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,479
Let's look for them together until the end...

317
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,880
without giving up.

318
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,759
Why don't you look for the director's car first?

319
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,529
We might be able to find Ji Eun's whereabouts, then.

320
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,299
Okay.

321
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,798
Anyway, why did your uncle tell you...

322
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,240
to install secret cameras in that clinic?

323
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,740
I don't know.

324
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,440
You should've asked him that first.

325
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,709
You almost got a criminal record, you idiot.

326
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,979
Hey, there's always a big purpose when he tells me to do something.

327
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
(Just and Kind Police of Civilians)

328
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:41,919
I'm not even sure if I can understand his profound purpose.

329
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,490
So how can I dare ask him?

330
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,089
Anyway, did you meet Jae Jin, my brother-in-law, in the station?

331
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,329
No.

332
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,059
I heard he was on a business trip.

333
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,828
Even the police found it strange...

that both the director and vice-director were away.

A business trip? Do doctors go on business trips?

336
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,569
So, that's why I couldn't reach him.

337
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,480
Hey. Didn't they feed you in the police station?

338
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,150
You're digging in.

339

Hey. It has your saliva on it.

Uncle Kang Sung, what brings you here?

348
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,930
I'm here to see how my future nephew-in-law is doing.

349
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,700
In-law?

350
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,230
Have a seat here.

351
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,970
Oh, so you were...

352
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,869
tracking an incident.

353
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,680
- To be honest, - Yes?

354
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:14,809
I think Ji Eun...

355
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,410
accompanied the hospital director.

356
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
So...

357
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,289
Oh, of course, I don't believe it yet.

358
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,619
Is that the hospital director's car?

359
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,758
Oh, yes.

360
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,758
He keeps driving to south...

361
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,430
One for my future nephew-in-law.

362
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,500
While moving toward the south,

363
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,798
he stops here.

364
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,099
- One more. - Thank you.

(Hamyang, Yangpyeong)

You're home.

367
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,220
Do Hyun's getting tutored by Mr. Moon.

368
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:56,849
I see.

369
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:29,619

Oh, you're home.

Oh, I spilled juice.

372
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,169
Do Hyun told me to change into Jae Jin's clothes.

373
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,230
That's why I'm in here.

374
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,269
He has a lot of nice clothes.

375
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,710
I happen to be very interested in fashion.

376
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:58,480
I'll see you tomorrow.

377
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,818
Yes. Good job today. Bye.

378
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:02,490
- Get home safe. - Bye.

379

Son. Do you want to grab a beer with me?

380
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,859
- Beer? - Yes.

381
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,400
What? Don't play dumb with me.

382
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,869
Did you think I didn't know Dad was giving it to you?

383
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,710
You and Dad giggled last time...

384
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,740
thinking I didn't know.

385
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,180
So you knew it all along.

386

You know us like the back of your hand.

Cheers.

388
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,990
By the way, Mom.

389
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,700
Dad has never done this before.

390
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,859
To go on a business trip for this long.

391
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:50,930
You're right.

392
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,170
Maybe Dad needs some rest.

393
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,109
Do Hyun, do you want to go on a trip with me this vacation?

394
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,480
For about a week. And skip all your private lessons.

395
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,619
- Really? - Yes.

396
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,849
I want to see the sea.

397
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,059
Sure.

398
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
(Constable Gu Kyung Tae)

399
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,869
Dr. No Yeong Won. I finally figured it out.

400
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,339
I'll meet you at the river park tomorrow.

401
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,230
Did you find him?

402
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:55,630
I checked...

403
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,710
all the CCTV footage from Yangpyeong to all highways...

404
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,339
until my nose bled.

405
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,980
Here.

406
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,880
After he left Yangpyeong, he took the highway.

407
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,920
So I checked all the CCTV footage on that road.

408
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,920
He kept passing.

409
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,589
South Icheon.

410
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Hamyang.

411
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,930
To Goseong toll gate.

412
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,759
He's moving toward the south.

413
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,598
And?

414
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,859
Then the last toll gate was...

415
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,329
Tongyeong.

416
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,339
Of course, I need to check...

417
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,269
where he went after that.

418
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:38,710
What matters is...

419
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,539
whether Ji Eun was sitting...

420
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,380
next to your husband or not.

421
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,849
What's going to reveal that?

422
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,750
The speeding ticket.

423
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,759
He got caught for speeding.

424
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,759
Here. Look.

425
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,789
Here. Someone's next to him.

426
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,329
Watch carefully.

427
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,269
Do you see it?

428
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,539
No.

429
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,339
It's impossible to see.

430
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,680
Then it's not confirmed.

431
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,380
No, I wouldn't give up here.

432
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,609
If I were to make a deduction,

433
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,220
to drive that far, you'd have to get gas.

434
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,619
And visit the restroom.

435
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,319
The rest area?

436
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,789
Bingo. From the CCTV at the rest area,

437
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,529
I found the car.

438
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,160
If you look here,

439
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,529
just before leaving the rest area, he stops by at a gas station.

440
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,700
And while fueling, they both get out of the car.

441
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,109
It must've been suffocating.

442
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
It's guaranteed.

443
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,480
See? It's not.

444
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,349
I was worried that it might be Ji Eun.

445
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,559
By the way, Dr. No.

446
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,160
I watched it carefully.

447
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,259
Your husband...

448
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:09,670
seems to be cheating on you.

449
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,268
How can he do that when he has...

450
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:14,299
a famous and successful wife?

451
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:16,609
Thank you for your work.

452
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,710
Then where's my Ji Eun?

453
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,509
Dr. No.

454
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,349
Are you just leaving?

455
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,650
When can you counsel me again? Tomorrow?

456
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,660
I'll give you a call.

457
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,630
Okay.

458
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,460
Give me a call.

462
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:13,920

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,589
He's heading to South Gyeongsang Province?

470
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,150
Visit Gu Kyung Tae.

471
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,348
Gu Kyung Tae? You mean Dr. Oh's boyfriend...

472
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,849
who became a police officer after 15 years of studying?

473
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:31,029
What do you think it means that Ms. No gave him her number?

474
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,900
To have him come to the hospital.

475
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,900
And why would Ms. No, a busy woman, want him to come to the hospital?

476
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,339
To use him.

477
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,479
Gu Kyung Tae must've seen Jae Jin's photo...

478
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,348
on Dr. Oh's phone,

479
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,119
and he'd suspect something was up between them.

480
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,018
Also,

481
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:57,490
You hid Dr. Oh's car, so it would be untraceable.

482
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,690
Then, whose car would he trace?

483
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Indeed.

484
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,559
You're the Agatha Christie of Korea.

485
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,029
See, son?

486
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,400
I told you I'd find you.

487
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,140
Were you surprised?

488
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,239
How did you know?

489
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,269
Do you think I was called the Agatha Christie of Korea for no reason?

490
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,279
This is what deduction is all about.

491
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,078
I don't trick others like someone...

492
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,650
by using psychology.

493
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,088
Anyway, finding Jae Jin is the priority.

494
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:05,859
Right. As long as Jae Jin returns safe and sound,

495
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,490
that's enough, isn't it?

496
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,529
It's enough if he returns safe and sound?

497
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,529
No. Even if he returns, he shouldn't be safe and sound.

498
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,139
By the way, why did you hide the fact...

499
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,368
that you were coming here from me?

500
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,309
You also have a knack for hiding things, don't you?

501
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,440
Not as much as you, Mother.

502
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:25,609
My goodness.

503
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,680
You just seem to be getting better at making harsh comments.

504
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,980
Anyway, Ms. No, we're on the same team now.

505
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,890
Shouldn't we find Jae Jin together?

506
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,039
Just like someone who ran away, he came so far.

507
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,109
Tongyeong is...

508
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:05,180
a very special place for me and Dr. Choi.

509
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,150
When Jae Jin was young, I brought him here for the first time.

510
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:13,320
In today's terms, you could call it a field trip.

511
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,929
I wanted Dr. Choi to experience the village of poets.

512
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,570
Perhaps...

513
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,539
Dr. Choi came here...

514
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,039
because of the memories from back then.

515
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,409
This is a soundless shout

516
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,780
It is an everlasting handkerchief of nostalgia

517
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,590
That I wave toward that blue field of ocean

518
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,659
Pure love, like the waves, sways in the wind

519
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,960
At the end of the post of the clear and upright ideology

520
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,769
Sorrow spreads its wings like a white heron

521
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,869
Oh, who is it?

522
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,309
The one who knew to hang one's sad and desperate heart

523
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:08,079
In midair for the first time?

524
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,940
I'm sure he's around here somewhere.

525
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,150
It is this place.

526
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,889
(101N 9999)

527
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,460
It would be better if...

528
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,170
I know. I was going to go. This is about my son.

529
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,840
Why did you appear on TV anyway?

530
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,710
It is amazing

531
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:25,250
We came to Yeongdeungpo together

532
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,049
It is amazing

533
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,988
Nice! Let's go!

534
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:32,689
Having a fun time

535
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,929
My life is going well

536
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,388
Excuse me?

537
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,260
We are going to have fun

538
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,759
It is amazing

539
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,768
Nice!

540
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:46,300
Having a fun time

541
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,070
Who are you?

542
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:54,039
Everyone. Hello.

543
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,550
I came because I had something to ask you.

544
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,079
Yes, what is it?

545
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,650
Nine-nine-nine-nine.

546
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,788
I'm looking for...

547
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:08,759
the owner of the car out there.

548
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,130
Does anyone know?

549
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,190
Do you know the owner of that car?

550
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,098
It's my son.

551
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,828
That's great.

552
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,368
He won't answer when I call him.

553
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:20,669
Oh, were you unable to reach him?

554
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,469
Did he arrive the day before last?

555
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,808
Didn't he say he was going to Yokji Island?

556
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,480
Right? He came and borrowed a car from me.

557
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,980
He came with his lady.

558
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,709
Oh, and where is that Yokji Island?

559
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,848
It takes about an hour from here by boat.

560
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,619
There aren't any more boats now.

561
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,019
There won't be one until tomorrow in the early morning.

562
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,829
Oh, you said he was your son, right?

563
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,289
Yes.

564
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,329
Then, please settle his bill.

565
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:51,570
Oh, shall I?

566
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,269
Well...

567
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,920
- They won't have wine, right? - No.

568
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,139
(First Leaf Soju)

569
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,739
I'm rather relieved.

570
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,980
If he's on an island, it'll only be a matter of time before we find him.

571
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,980
Is this something to feel relieved about?

572
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,920
We're here to catch him in the act of an affair.

573
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,889
Ms. No.

574
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,460
I know my son Jae Jin well.

575
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,559
I can see how Jae Jin, who has such an innocent soul,

576
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,800
would have fallen for that scary girl.

577
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,599
Also, men just do that sometimes.

578
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,710
Especially, from Dr. Choi's perspective,

579
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,079
he could become curious about a woman...

580
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,519
who is the complete opposite of you, the perfect wife.

581
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,550
Is having an affair something that's passed down through generations?

582
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,690
Just like his father...

583
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,059
How was it for you, Mother?

584
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,059
When Father did such a thing.

585
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,570
I didn't expect much.

586
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,710
Then, I suddenly realized...

587
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,440
that I should've expected something.

588
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,239
That way,

589
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,210
he would've blamed himself...

590
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,949
for letting his family down at the very least.

591
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,489
So,

592
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,750
are you saying I should expect something from Jae Jin?

593
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,489
Until the end?

594
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,130
Still, Jae Jin listened to you.

595
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,059
Why is that important?

596
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,760
That was all a ploy to fool me.

597
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,269
Ms. No.

598
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,639
I'm not asking you to understand Jae Jin.

599
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,739
But you must think about your family.

600
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,079
You have received the expectations of our family.

601
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,280
Are you sure you can let that down?

602
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,050
Will you be able to handle yourself after letting that down?

603
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,789
You mean a family for yourself.

604
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,559
I wonder if I really am part of this family.

605
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,730
What would you do if Do Hyun was in this situation?

606
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:40,670
Like a certain poet said, a son...

607
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,139
makes you desperate just by calling him.

608
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,809
That's how a mother feels.

609
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,079
You and I are mothers first, and women second.

610
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:17,469
(Ferry)

611
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,750
Welcome.

612
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,320
I asked him to come.

613
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,449
It's not easy to search through an island, you know.

614
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,360
Hello. My name is Park Kang Sung.

615
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,190
Hello. We've met before, haven't we?

616
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,158
You're the patient who found secret cameras in the clinic...

617
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,630
and Dr. Oh's uncle.

618
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,400
Things happened that way.

619
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,099
I apologize.

620
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,440
Did you look into the rented car?

621
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,340
Yes. I tracked it down...

622
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,139
and found a record of it boarding a ship to Yokji Island.

623
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,449
But there was no record of it returning here.

624
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,448
I think the car is still on the island.

625
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:01,079
Thank goodness. It's such a relief.

626
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:04,288
Do you know what time the first ship to the island takes off?

627
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,489
I'll look into that.

628
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,800
Why did you have to call me all the way over to Tongyeong?

629
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,230
I didn't know you were here too, ma'am.

630
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,670
How have you been?

631
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,170
I called him over.

632
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,179
Anyway, why is Seung Jae's uncle here?

633
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,579
Seung Jae?

634
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,050
Seung Jae who makes corn guksu at a corn guksu place?

635
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,690
So your friend is...

636
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,789
Mr. Park's nephew?

637
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,559
And you're the madam he's working for?

638
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,429
What?

639
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,569
Jae Jin is on an island with some woman?

640
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,510
Is he out of his mind?

641
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,769
Calm down.

642
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,510
I'm not in the situation to go around freely,

643
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,050
so I called you over.

644
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:05,980
I didn't know Mr. Park would come.

645
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:07,219
Yeong Won.

646
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Seung Jae's uncle serves Madam Hong.

647
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,190
And I'll serve you. Don't worry.

648
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,960
Are you leaving? See you.

649
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:26,840
Jae Jin, where are you?

650
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,469
Yeong Won is going to Yokji Island to get you tomorrow.

651
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,610
Call me first when you read this.

652
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:44,789
(Director Kang)

653
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:47,920
(Director Kang)

654
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
Dr. Oh, are you okay?

655
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:53,130
Dr. Oh, are you feeling all right?

656
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:57,170
Yes, madam.

657
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:58,400
What is wrong with her?

658
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:01,570
What is wrong with her?

659
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,138
Well...

660
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:05,969
She's inarticulate right now,

661
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,739
but she'll eventually get better.

662
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,949
Here.

663
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,149
Dr. Oh, do you remember that day?

664
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,619
You went to the vacation home.

665
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:17,219
Yes.

666
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,119
I...

667
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,988
I went to the vacation home.

668
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,460
Gosh, it's frustrating. What...

669
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,129
Can't we just exchange texts?

670
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,500
Hold on, Mother.

671
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,469
Dr. Oh.

672
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:33,340
Did you perhaps see Jae Jin in the vacation home?

673
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,909
What is that? Does it mean a no?

674
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,179
I didn't even get...

675
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,510
to see him.

676
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,250
I heard we'd die.

677
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,860
- What? - What?

678
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,690
I heard we would all die.

679
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,699
That everyone was going to die.

680
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,130
That we were going to die!

681
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:07,839
Dr. No! That my Jae Jin...

682
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,109
That my Jae Jin would die!

683
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,570
- She's in shock. - That he would die!

684
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,679
I'll stabilize her and call you again.

685
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:15,840
Nurse!

686
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,079
What was she saying?

687
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:41,469
(Yokji Island)

688
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,800
When did they start this relationship?

689
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:12,530
A year and six months?

690
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:15,400
It's probably been that long.

691
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:20,639
I was the only one in the dark.

692
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,780
I recently found out that it was still going on.

693
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:28,980
I thought...

694
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,320
they broke up back then.

695
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:38,929
I should say...

696
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:42,500
she had a strange vibe for a patient.

697
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:54,539
(Director's Office)

698
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,480
It was around then...

699
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,710
that Jae Jin started changing.

700
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,820
Hello.

701
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,119
Will you have lunch with me?

702
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,389
We'll have dessert first.

703
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,989
You probably didn't know, but I could see through my son.

704
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,828
Did you leave them be when you knew about his affair?

705
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:46,860
- Bye. - Bye.

706
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,199
- No. - Goodbye.

707
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,730
I didn't just leave them be.

708
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,769
(101N 9999)

709
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,760
You're Novelist Hong Sa Kang, right?

710
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:22,099
I'm a huge fan of yours.

711
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,349
Maternal love...

712
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,590
is beautiful...

713
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:47,619
and sad.

714
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,860
She was cheeky.

715
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:53,059
To look back on that moment, she was different.

716
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:58,230
Unexpectedly enough, she understood right away.

717
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:01,699
She took the checks, so it was all over then.

718
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,738
I mean, I thought it was all over.

719
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,440
Jae Jin said he broke up with her.

720
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,880
Why didn't you tell me?

721
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:13,519
Because we were family.

722
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,860
The winds are blowing too much.

723
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,059
Anyway, I wonder what her intentions are.

724
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,099
You said she was cheeky.

725
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,170
She took the money, so why again?

726
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:35,199
Dr. No.

727
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,769
What kind of mental state would you say she's in?

728
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,610
In my opinion, this is just an affair.

729
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,779
To say that she's after the insurance money...

730
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,979
like the private detective said,

731
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,719
this affair has been going on for too long.

732
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,349
Isn't it strange?

733
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,119
Just what's on her mind?

734
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,630
Mother.

735
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,029
You ask me a question, but you don't listen to my answer.

736
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,329
What's on your mind?

737
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,230
Have I?

738
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:05,800
Dr. No.

739
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:10,739
Don't be too sensitive. Your skin might age.

740
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,260
I saw her on TV.

741
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,359
- Me too. - Who is she?

742
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,130
- Isn't she Dr. No Yeong Won? - She isn't.

743
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,269
She's pretty.

744
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,159
- Young Min. - Yes?

745
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:06,960
Check the CCTV footage nearby.

746
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,130
Okay. Now?

747
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,400
We won't eat first?

748
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,739
Fine. But why won't you feed someone...

749
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,170
and just make them work?

750
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,570
Hurry.

751
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,980
Fine. I'm going. See?

752
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,349
Gosh, she's so pretty.

753
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,650
She looks amazing.

754
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,960
My goodness.

755
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,360
Hey, get in.

756
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,469
Why be on television?

757
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,638
- We should hurry. - Right.

758
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,110
- Mr. Park. - Yes?

759
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,480
Where's a good restaurant here?

760
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,710
A good restaurant?

761
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,280
Jae Jin is a gourmet.

762
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,849
You really don't know your husband.

763
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:08,690
Jae Jin is a light eater,

764
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,530
but he enjoys having seasonal foods.

765
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,460
Wherever he goes,

766
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,730
he's a warmhearted gourmet that looks for a good place to eat.

767
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,099
He would've visited a good restaurant first.

768
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,880
I found one.

769
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Where is it?

770
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,690
It's Gesekki Jjamppong.

771
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,760
- Sorry? - Gesekki?

772
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:44,859
It's not what you think.

773
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,230
Crab for "Ge," shrimp for "Sewoo," and pen shell for "Kijogae."

774
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,199
That is why it's Gesekki Jjamppong.

775
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,738
It's a place you must visit on this island.

776
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:56,738
That sounds delicious. Geseggi Jjamppong.

777
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:57,869
Mother,

778
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,510
It's Gesekki Jjamppong.

779
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,380
Gesekki Jjamppong.

780
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,480
Then I will depart.

781
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:29,969
You've brought the pictures of Lee Se Na, right?

782
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,170
Yes. But why do you ask about the pictures?

783
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:37,880
I can't be going around saying I'm looking for my 40-year-old son.

784
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,079
How impressive.

785
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:47,159
You'll be in the car, right?

786
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,460
I know that showing your face won't be a good idea.

787
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,730
(Jjamppong, pork gukbap)

788
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,840
Has this person visited this place before?

789
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,379
We have so many customers that visit us.

790
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,940
How would I remember every single person?

791
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,280
I'm busy, so please move away.

792
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:14,949
We know that you're busy.

793
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,058
(Soft Hands)

794
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,260
I make pretty good noodles myself.

795
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:27,260
You should get some rest.

796
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,369
She does look a bit familiar.

797
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,409
Have you seen her?

798
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,808
Isn't this her? She came around four days ago.

799
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:44,948
- Don't you remember her? - I don't.

800
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:47,349
The two of them ordered so much food.

801
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,650
The very pretty woman and the man that ate a lot.

802
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,489
Right!

803
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,919
They were incredible.

804
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,159
- Didn't they sit there? - You're right.

805
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:02,159
I remember them because that man ate so much.

806
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:07,070
It's delicious. You should eat too.

807
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,078
- What is it? - It feels like an eating show.

808
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,149
It's fun to watch.

809
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,179
- Is that so? - Yes.

810
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,989
Should I switch jobs while I'm at it?

811
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:30,090
"I'll be eating Chinese food today."

812
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,699
I should add in some rice.

813
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,599
No.

814
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,569
No.

815
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,570
Hold on.

816
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:45,570
Did you say he ate a lot?

817
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,679
Have you mistaken him for someone else?

818
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:53,679
My son doesn't eat a lot.

819
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:57,090
He usually eats salads and foods high in protein.

820
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,259
Right. The really pretty woman didn't eat a lot.

821
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,590
The man ate incredibly.

822
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,888
He had a large bowl of Gesekki Jjamppong.

823
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,459
He had a tangsuyuk, a yusanseul,

824
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,329
an ohyangjangyuk, and even a palbochae.

825
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,070
I thought he was filming for an eating show.

826
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,768
I felt sorry for your daughter.

827
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,238
The man must be rich.

828
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,238
That must be why he eats like a pig.

829
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,079
I just kept it at that in my mind.

830
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,250
Mr. Park, let's get going.

831
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,519
Why is it so noisy outside this morning?

832
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,730
I don't know. It's a mess out there.

833
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,059
I think I heard that someone committed suicide.

834
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,099
They found a car in the sea.

835
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,329
All have died.

836
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,469
All men who were related to her have died.

837
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,179
What on earth is going on?

838
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,119
I'll tell you once I get back.

839
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,718
It's strange that you want everything canceled.

840
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,590
You've never done that before.

841
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:08,888
Oh, Yeong Won,

842
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:12,329
the Buddhist saint told me you should head south to find a way.

843
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,960
South?

844
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:16,969
I see. That saint must be good.

845
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,239
Hurry up and get in, Ms. No.

846
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,940
I'll call you again.

847
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:29,280
Where are we going now?

848
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,710
Did you find him?

849
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,780
I heard a car was found in the sea.

850
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,289
- A car? - Yes.

851
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:14,889
- What's going on? - Did you hear?

852
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:52,760
(Restricted Access)

853
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:57,030
(83H 2949)

854
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,440
Gosh.

855
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,639
It isn't his car, right?

856
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:08,808
(83H 2949)

857
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:11,409
H 2949.

858
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,619
It is his car. The one Dr. Choi rented.

859
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,780
Oh, gosh!

860
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:39,269
What is that?

861
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,579
Mother!

862
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,630
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

863
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,929
There are things that have happened that you can't know about.

864
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,559
You feel relieved, don't you?

865
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:39,630
I told you that we needed to call the police.

866
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,339
It's upsetting not knowing why he had to die.

867
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,710
I just don't get what's going on.

868
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:48,380
I don't know what is real and what is fake.

869
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,250
I'm not even sure about my own family.

870
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:53,849
- They will all die. - You cut your hair.

871
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,619
I'm scared too. But what can I do?

872
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,019
I'm Do Hyun's mom.

873
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,489
I can't let myself break down like this.
