1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,009
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,040
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,750
She has the other person by the nuts...

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,320
and tries to have them under her control.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,919
She thinks she holds the initiative of this game.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,660
She's a typical example of a narcissist.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,030
Really? Then, let's use it in our favor...

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,268
to lure Lee Se Na out from the shadow.

10
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,600
Narcissists...

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,270
feel furious and impatient...

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,609
when they can't get what they want or when their misdeeds are exposed.

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,539
They're like little kids who cannot control their emotions.

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:39,679
I know.

15
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,978
Some kids lie down and pester at the top of their lungs...

16
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,548
when their parents don't buy them what they want.

17
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,749
I bet it's similar.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,689
Right.

19
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,259
That's what I'm talking about.

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,530
If we make her angry and furious,

21
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,460
she might not know what to do...

22
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:58,859
and lose her control.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,228
Then, she will probably show herself...

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,670
as she throws a bad tantrum.

25
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,870
So,

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,969
we better not do what she wants us to do.

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
Exactly.

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,750
Anyway, what are you going to do about the press conference?

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,680
I think Do Hyun is right.

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,319
If we do care for him with respect,

31
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,760
we shouldn't take the exposal as a threat.

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,359
Do Hyun...

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,530
didn't do anything...

34
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,700
shameful or wrong.

35
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,200
Then, hold the press conference with pride.

36
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,209
Lee Se Na started this game.

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,180
Let's play it.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,899
(No Yeong Won's Urgent Press Conference)

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,899
- Go back to your seats. - Ms. No.

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,870
- Go back. - Goodness.

41
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,139
I am...

42
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,840
a hypocrite.

43
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,938
What is said during the cross-interrogation...

44
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,439
holds legal power, right?

45
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,080
That's right.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
But he might be aware of it.

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,780
He'll probably be careful not to make mistakes.

48
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,729
You're actually here.

49
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,629
All right.

50
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,340
Dinner.

51
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,150
This plan is for the ending that will satisfy you.

52
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,659
You'll be released soon, so drag some time.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,569
I wonder why you are here.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,469
I already said no.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,969
I said no as well.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,878
Dr. No thinks Lee Se Na plotted this case.

57
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,080
But I disagree.

58
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,280
This is about who killed An Yo Sub...

59
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,419
and attacked me that day.

60
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,889
Are you saying it was me?

61
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,789
The vacation home was too dark that day.

62
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,530
No matter how much I try to remember,

63
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,430
I can't come up with a face.

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,460
But...

65
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,129
he couldn't get rid of the smell.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,370
Wait. The smell?

67
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,369
Do you remember it?

68
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,780
According to Patrick Suskind's novel,

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,509
"Perfume,"

70
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,319
every human being has their own unique scent.

71
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,149
And like the novel's main character,

72
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,860
I have an acute sense of smell.

73
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,020
What are you saying?

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,100
Oh, really?

75
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,230
This is how I reason it.

76
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,500
An Yo Sub always used the same cologne.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,068
He worked at my house for 15 years,

78
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:28,870
so of course, I was aware of it.

79
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,709
But the man who attacked me that day...

80
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,649
didn't carry that scent.

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,750
How should I put it?

82
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,819
It was a rotten smell.

83
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,290
What nonsense are you saying?

84
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,528
It can't be evidence.

85
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,990
No.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,898
I'm saying I can use the smell to find him...

87
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,129
like drawing a facial composite.

88
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,740
The person who blackmailed me and my family...

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,910
forced me to read this script...

90
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,980
which I read just now.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,579
But I...

92
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,360
decided not to do what she wanted.

93
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,699
Try smelling this.

94
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,899
Me?

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,069
Compare it...

96
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,740
with that man's body odor.

97
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,439
Then, you'll understand what I mean.

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,579
Do I have to smell him?

99
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,259
Darn it!

100
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,490
Stop lying.

101
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,529
I didn't wear any cologne that day.

102
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,230
And I was...

103
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,769
in a fireproof suit. You couldn't have possibly smelled me.

104
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,699
Bingo.

105
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,610
That's why I didn't smell anything from you.

106
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,549
You were wrapped with something...

107
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,610
that kept rustling.

108
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,519
Isn't this a confession?

109
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,449
Right.

110
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,459
(General)

111
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,459
No.

112
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,629
No. It really wasn't me.

113
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,399
Lee Se Na killed An Yo Sub.

114
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,638
She killed him?

115
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,568
No. It was him.

116
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,809
I'm telling you! It's true.

117
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,910
No, it was you.

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,448
Lee Se Na wasn't at the vacation home that day.

119
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,679
I didn't smell her anywhere in the place.

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,050
That's absurd.

121
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,448
She was there for sure.

122
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,589
She killed him...

123
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,920
and called No Yeong Won over.

124
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,459
But I called you over before that. Do you get it?

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,129
- I see. - Do you get it now?

126
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,970
What the...

127
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,939
What's with you people?

128
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,480
What is this?

129
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:25,219
- What is this? - Come here.

130
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,519
You think you'll be safe?

131
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:30,589
How dare you deceive me!

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,518
You won't be safe! Hong Sa Kang!

133
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,560
Move.

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,360
Can you have Lee Se Na wanted openly now?

135
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,839
She's already been revealed.

136
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,310
What?

137
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,708
In the afternoon today, Oh, the prime suspect...

138
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,610
of the vacation home murder case with Dr. No Yeong Won involved,

139
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,648
confessed about an accomplice,

140
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,088
and the case entered a new phase.

141
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,588
During the police investigation,

142
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,588
Oh testified that his accomplice, Lee,

143
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,659
actually committed the murder.

144
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,888
According to the identification,

145
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,128
Lee turned out to be...

146
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,859
the blackmailer whom Dr. No Yeong Won revealed...

147
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,829
during the press conference a while ago.

148
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,829
The police have decided to search for the suspect openly.

149
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,068
They are analyzing security camera footage...

150
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:20,970
and taking all means possible to arrest the suspect.

151
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,850
Se Na.

152
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,100
It's time to admit to your sin.

153
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,139
What did I commit?

154
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,169
You made us burn!

155
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,610
This is why...

156
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,750
it was your mistake to kill me.

157
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,690
You have no one else to help you now.

158
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,850
You've lost.

159
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,389
Why did you do that to me when I loved you so much?

160
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,830
Why did you do it?

161
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,600
You've lost.

162
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
No.

163
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,250
I haven't lost.

164
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,939
(It has been revealed that Dr. No Yeong Won...)

165
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,299
(was continuously blackmailed by the stalker, Lee.)

166
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,169
So Yi, check this out.

167
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,879
I guess people are taking my mom's side.

168
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,879
- It's a relief. - I know.

169
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,480
Let me go to the bathroom.

170
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,179
Okay.

171
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,389
(Under Cleaning)

172
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,750
Who are you?

173
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,870
(Under Cleaning)

174
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,899
(Episode 12: Almost Ordinary Family)

175
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,529
You...

176
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,070
Where is my son right now?

177
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,970
He's sound asleep.

178
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,980
If you do something to him,

179
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,549
I'll kill you.

180
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,919
I want you to suffer a little more.

181
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,389
If you call the police,

182
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,019
your son will die.

183
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,590
Lee Se Na.

184
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,669
Lee Se Na!

185
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,178
- Honey. - What's wrong?

186
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,149
- Are you okay? - Dr. No.

187
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,809
Goodness.

188
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,179
(Lee Se Na, Video)

189
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,419
(Lee Se Na)

190
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,789
- My gosh. - Do Hyun!

191
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:55,610
Oh, goodness.

192
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,639
No...

193
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,850
No.

194
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,059
Do Hyun.

195
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,600
When I tap this button, boom.

196
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,529
I don't have to explain more, do I?

197
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,080
If you want to save him,

198
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,779
come to the vacation home alone before the sunrise.

199
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,049
Don't do anything stupid, or your son...

200
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,049
will face the loneliest death in this world.

201
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,239
We must... Wait, Dr. No. Just a moment.

202
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,768
Mother. I must hurry there.

203
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,309
I must go for our Do Hyun!

204
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,439
I'll go with you. I can't let you go alone.

205
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,509
No.

206
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,849
We don't know what will happen to him then.

207
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,518
I can't let you go there alone!

208
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,789
- No. - Everyone, calm down!

209
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,990
I know how you feel, Dr. No. But just a second.

210
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,100
When Jae Jin was assumed dead,

211
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I thought cool-headedly and ended up finding him.

212
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,440
Lee Se Na is starting a game with us.

213
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,610
Do Hyun may not be at the vacation home.

214
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,149
- Please calm down. - Sit down.

215
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,190
Sit down.

216
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,659
Here. Look at this.

217
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,289
Look.

218
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,229
There's a small window here.

219
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,398
The wall behind him is higher than it's seen.

220
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,399
It means they're in a basement room.

221
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,969
But the vacation home has no basement floor.

222
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,240
Then, could he be somewhere else?

223
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,409
If he's not at the vacation home...

224
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,048
We just have to find Do Hyun...

225
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,990
before the sunrise.

226
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,860
We still have time.

227
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,190
Oh, goodness.

228
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,629
We can take care of this for sure.

229
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,399
I know we can handle this together.

230
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,620
I usually don't work during bedtime.

231
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,549
You are a sleepyhead. I barely woke you up.

232
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,158
You'll sleep for good once you die.

233
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,629
Why don't you focus a little and help us out?

234
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,089
You said you were a private detective.

235
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,459
There's no time. What do you think about Do Hyun's situation?

236
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,630
He's not at the vacation home.

237
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,500
It has no basement floor.

238
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,470
We can't be sure that he's on a basement floor.

239
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,809
It could be a warehouse or a container down an empty lot.

240
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,910
I don't hear any cars. It might be a quiet countryside area.

241
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,579
A private detective is different, indeed.

242
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,180
Given Lee Se Na's tendency or pattern,

243
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,588
she doesn't play a game that cannot be solved.

244
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:33,359
That means it's somewhere related to her.

245
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,390
Maybe she left a message in the video.

246
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,899
You know, psychopaths enjoy throwing messages.

247
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,629
It's how they feel a sense of superiority.

248
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,240
Well... "Don't do anything stupid,"

249
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,169
"or your son will face the loneliest death in this world."

250
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,710
He will die lonely?

251
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,980
Why did she include the word, lonely, there?

252
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,078
I think she left a clue unconsciously.

253
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,250
For Lee Se Na, the loneliest place...

254
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,348
was her home.

255
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,990
Then, Lee Se Na's house?

256
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,288
The house that was caught on fire when she was little.

257
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,329
I wonder if it's still there.

258
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,930
The house in Gangneung.

259
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,999
Lee Se Na purchased it.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,999
Then, let's go straight to Gangneung.

261
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,970
But she owns another house in Ganghwa.

262
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,470
It's where her third husband was burned to death.

263
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,140
Why is he saying that at this timing?

264
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,339
It may not be her house.

265
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:32,279
The orphanage she frequents. That's another possibility.

266
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,220
It's close to the vacation home.

267
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,258
Then, I'll head to the orphanage first.

268
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,160
I'll check the place and go straight to the vacation home.

269
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,959
Go there without me. I'll follow you right away.

270
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,059
Then, I'll head to Gangneung with Madam Hong.

271
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,069
We'll head to Ganghwa, then.

272
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:51,969
Right. Let's split up.

273
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,069
Dr. No, head to the vacation home.

274
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,539
- Okay. - Okay.

275
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,679
- Check that side. - Okay.

276
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,950
Do Hyun.

277
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,779
Do Hyun.

278
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,779
Do Hyun!

279
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,450
Do Hyun!

280
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,460
Did you find him?

281
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,690
No. He's not here.

282
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,289
Is there another space on the basement floor?

283
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,940
(Thursday, January 4)

284
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,130
Do Hyun.

285
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,299
Hey! Young Min!

286
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,349
Okay. Go to the vacation home for now.

287
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,650
We have to cross out the house in Ganghwa.

288
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,559
- I think we got the right place. - Right.

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,069
(Jae Jin)

290
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,940
Jae Jin. Did you find him?

291
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,670
It's not the orphanage.

292
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,539
I see.

293
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,309
I think I have to go inside.

294
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,279
I'll head to the vacation home right away.

295
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,779
Be careful not to get caught.

296
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,579
We shouldn't provoke her, so don't come too close.

297
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,049
Honey.

298
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,450
- Be careful. - Okay.

299
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,279
Where is Do Hyun?

300
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,190
I've missed you, Dr. No.

301
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,589
I asked where Do Hyun is.

302
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,759
You got the order wrong.

303
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,930
We need to talk first.

304
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,039
Yes.

305
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,279
What is it that you want to tell me?

306
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,480
My family abandoned me saying I was a monster.

307
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,619
Then you said...

308
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,759
I should cut off a ruined family.

309
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,129
Was I more wrong than those people who tried to cut me off?

310
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,200
That's a misunderstanding.

311
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,869
What I meant was...

312
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,299
to avoid living in pain...

313
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,108
just because you were family.

314
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,509
Be quiet.

315
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,809
It's my turn to speak.

316
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,279
So I was curious...

317
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,588
if you'd cut your family off after admitting...

318
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:12,818
that they were ruined.

319
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,160
Is that what you want?

320
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,559
Then I will do that.

321
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,369
Spare Do Hyun's life.

322
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,809
That's not the answer I want.

323
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,980
Why are you holding it back?

324
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:35,649
Why are you trying to protect them?

325
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,650
Your parents-in-law who killed your dad and fooled you,

326
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,278
your husband who lived a fake life,

327
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,519
and your son who lied to you! Why?

328
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,960
Why are you not abandoning them?

329
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,289
Now...

330
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,029
answer me.

331
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,880
(Mother)

332
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:17,789
Yes, Mother?

333
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,088
He's not at the orphanage either.

334
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,160
No?

335
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,460
Then he's got to be here.

336
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,759
What about Dr. No?

337
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,500
I think she's in the vacation home.

338
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,329
Yes, Dr. Choi.

339
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,569
I will find Do Hyun.

340
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:36,210
You have to protect Dr. No, okay? I'll call you back.

341
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:37,640
Okay.

342
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,480
Yes.

343
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,650
You might think I'm a hypocrite. No.

344
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,720
I know I look like a hypocrite to you.

345
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,960
But they had no choice but to do that...

346
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,460
in order to protect this family.

347
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,230
I have no doubt about that.

348
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,639
That is the definition of a ruined family.

349
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,240
It is a ruined family.

350
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,769
But now,

351
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,639
I look back at each person...

352
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,150
in the name of family.

353
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,220
Enough to live as a ruined family.

354
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,750
No.

355
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,390
You're lying to me.

356
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,990
You want to abandon them, but you're refraining yourself.

357
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,700
I want to abandon them now.

358
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,299
But I finally...

359
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,440
understand what it means to be a family.

360
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,769
I mean that.

361
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,680
Don't say you understand!

362
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,819
You said they were ruined!

363
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,990
You know what?

364
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,758
My family never tried to understand me for once.

365
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,858
They said I was ruined, and it was all my fault!

366
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,759
Your family didn't abandon you.

367
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,200
Your wrongful obsession made them leave.

368
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,799
I can still help you.

369
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,210
So let's get out of here together.

370
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,119
I know the reason...

371
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:35,890
I wasn't loved.

372
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,460
But still...

373
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,970
For at least once...

374
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,569
I wanted a family who'd never abandon me to the end.

375
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,849
Mom!

376
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,269
- Mr. Park. - Yes.

377
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,170
Do Hyun's in here.

378
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,509
Give me a moment.

379
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,690
Do Hyun!

380
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,559
Do Hyun!

381
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,099
Yes! In here!

382
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm in here!

383
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,779
Here!

384
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,819
I'm in here!

385
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,390
Perhaps...

386
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,930
we're standing at the same point.

387
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,470
We dreamed and expected a perfect family.

388
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,470
But we finally realized...

389
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,170
that was wrong.

390
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,880
It's not too late yet.

391
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,839
We can create it together.

392
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,019
I'll help you.

393
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,289
Okay?

394
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,890
So spare Do Hyun's life.

395
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,930
Please.

396
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,539
What the heck?

397
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,170
You almost brainwashed me.

398
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,440
So the point is, you can't cut them off?

399
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,180
Then I'll cut them off for you.

400
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,650
No!

401
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,650
Live in the pain of killing your son.

402
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,490
My Do Hyun... Save my Do Hyun!

403
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,190
My Do Hyun!

404
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,289
Where...

405
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,599
No.

406
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,630
My Do Hyun!

407
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:37,400
No...

408
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,269
Do Hyun...

409
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,740
Do Hyun!

410
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,589
Do Hyun!

411
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,559
Do Hyun!

412
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,160
My Do Hyun... Bring back my Do Hyun!

413
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:10,930
Bring back my Do Hyun!

414
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,839
My Do Hyun...

415
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,200
Bring back my Do Hyun!

416
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,309
My Do Hyun... Bring back my Do Hyun!

417
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,980
My Do Hyun... Bring back my Do Hyun!

418
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:31,389
Do Hyun!

419
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,719
We need to get out of here!

420
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,288
We saved Do Hyun. He's alive.

421
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,029
Do Hyun is alive.

422
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,960
Do Hyun is alive.

423
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,470
Let's get out of here.

424
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,730
In the end, I'm alone again.

425
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
If I'd met someone,

426
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,410
would I have a family who'd never let me go like you?

427
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,590
Goodbye, Dr. No Yeong Won.

428
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,199
We have to go.

429
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,449
Mom.

430
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:53,159
- Do Hyun. - Mom.

431
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,159
Are you okay?

432
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,329
Honey. Are you okay?

433
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,900
Yeong Won.

434
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,070
Yeong Won.

435
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,920
Dr. No.

436
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,948
I should've burned that darn vacation home to ashes...

437
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,920
a long time ago.

438
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,630
You could've died there.

439
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,570
Yeong Won.

440
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,110
What about Lee Se Na?

441
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,780
A witch is bound to be burned to death.

442
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,190
It was horrible.

443
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,789
Ji Eun.

444
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:08,400
Ji Eun?

445
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,400
Why are you forgiven so easily?

446
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,480
Because of you,

447
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,480
my life was full of pain.

448
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,448
Ji Eun. Let's talk outside.

449
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:29,190
What about my sufferings?

450
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,150
What about my pain?

451
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,119
It's nothing to you people, isn't it?

452
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,900
You treated me like your own.

453
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,929
You told me so many times that you counted on me.

454
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:46,300
Why is it No Yeong Won?

455
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,340
Why can't it be me?

456
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:51,369
I...

457
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,539
devoted my everything too.

458
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,750
It should've been me.

459
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,250
It should've been me!

460
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,090
- Ji Eun. - Don't.

461
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,289
Ji Eun.

462
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,469
It's all right.

463
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,539
It's okay. It's all right.

464
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,638
- Are you okay? - I'm okay. Jae Jin.

465
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,439
- But you... - I'm okay.

466
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,110
What's wrong with her? Goodness.

467
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,440
You're awake.

468
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,820
Did you hate me enough to want to kill me?

469
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,320
Too bad. I'm not dead.

470
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,829
I understand how you feel, and I mean it.

471
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,699
I'm sorry, Ji Eun.

472
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,309
Oh, come on.

473
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,820
I shouldn't have done that to you.

474
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,719
I called you family, but I used you.

475
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,559
Saying that I counted on you, I forced you to sacrifice.

476
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,429
I obviously knew that you were dying to be loved.

477
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,639
Have you...

478
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,440
thought of me...

479
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,510
as part of your family at least for once?

480
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,050
Perhaps, I wanted to be part of your family...

481
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,860
more than how much I liked Jae Jin.

482
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,500
I wanted to be your family.

483
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Right.

484
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:05,969
Ji Eun.

485
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,809
Ji Eun.

486
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,980
Why don't we forget about what happened today...

487
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,949
and spend...

488
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,960
a little more time with each other?

489
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,530
Ji Eun.

490
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,340
Ji Eun. You should come too.

491
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,769
Gosh. Uncle?

492
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,739
Did you come after hearing the news?

493
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:21,239
I didn't call you in case you'd worry.

494
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:23,049
Let me go see Ji Eun first.

495
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,150
Wait.

496
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,579
Yes?

497
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:29,249
Mr. Gu.

498
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,690
Gosh. Don't make it feel awkward all of a sudden, Uncle.

499
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
I am...

500
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,230
not Ji Eun's uncle.

501
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,690
What?

502
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,328
Stop joking already.

503
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:40,900
This is the hospital, and Ji Eun is not well.

504
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,800
- Okay? Uncle. - Goodness.

505
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,429
- It's... - What...

506
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,070
a long story to tell.

507
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,009
Lee, the real culprit of the vacation home murder case,

508
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,038
set a fire on the vacation home, where she committed the murder,

509
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,339
and killed herself.

510
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,038
Now the vacation home murder case...

511
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,578
is left only with the trial...

512
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,109
of Oh, the accomplice.

513
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,050
The police already secured Lee's confession.

514
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,559
It's all over now.

515
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,130
I'm sorry for everything.

516
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,260
I know you can't forgive me,

517
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,940
but do let me know if there's a way to put things back.

518
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,070
I'll try.

519
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,769
Will we...

520
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,550
be able to go back to how we were before?

521
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,679
I don't think forgiveness matters.

522
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,360
Let's forget...

523
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,829
about dedicating our lives to someone...

524
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,030
for some time.

525
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,650
It doesn't look like a cross at all, so why is it called cross-stitching?

526
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,679
Turn it a little. Then, it'd look like a cross.

527
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,519
I see. I get it.

528
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:14,690
I didn't know about that.

529
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,429
On a day like today,

530
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,860
it'd be so nice if your dad were with us.

531
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,460
Mom.

532
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,869
You came back?

533
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,670
Is it you?

534
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:28,369
What...

535
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,840
Doctor.

536
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,940
He's still very sick.

537
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,610
I have an incurable disease, Mom.

538
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,448
I'm sorry, Mom.

539
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,190
How do I do this?

540
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:47,289
But I couldn't help it.

541
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,460
Dad...

542
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,960
shouldn't have done it because he was a dad.

543
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:56,969
Even so,

544
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,840
I should've embraced him and faced things with him.

545
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,610
Would he...

546
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:06,280
understand me now, Mom?

547
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,239
Goodness.

548
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:15,079
Doctor.

549
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,489
My mom said...

550
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:22,320
that moms and dads forgive everything.

551
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,400
And that...

552
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,199
it's nice to cry from time to time.

553
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,710
It's the lady who reads me books.

554
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:40,679
Madam Hong?

555
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,460
I heard you visited her from time to time.

556
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,360
I visited once in a while. Not so often.

557
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,230
Would you give this to your mother?

558
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,449
Thank you.

559
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,619
What do you say?

560
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,090
This means you can help yourselves with what each of you wants.

561
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,829
I love it.

562
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:35,429
Children.

563
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,599
All along, I thought...

564
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,069
a family must gather together...

565
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:47,380
at the table at all times.

566
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,749
But I saw it somewhere...

567
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,279
that since a family started not to have breakfast together,

568
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,980
it became much more peaceful.

569
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,219
What kind of family are they?

570
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,559
All along,

571
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,300
I forced you in order to make...

572
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:10,730
the kind of family I wanted.

573
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,570
It rather resulted in keeping you in cages.

574
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,480
So as of today,

575
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,119
I will no longer be this family's keeper.

576
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:31,320
I've decided to leave the house.

577
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:33,820
- What? - Mother.

578
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,460
Let's be faithful to each of our lives now.

579
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:45,469
Have you watched the movie, "Avatar?"

580
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,969
I see you.

581
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,809
I see what you have in mind.

582
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,179
I know very well about you kids.

583
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,849
I see you.

584
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Perhaps, the true meaning of love...

585
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,960
is just to watch the other person.

586
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,539
Then, is this...

587
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:24,610
our last time eating all together?

588
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,039
Let's gather and eat together...

589
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,380
when we want, okay?

590
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,480
All right. Toast.

591
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,239
Let's eat.

592
00:48:58,239 --> 00:48:59,309
Okay.

593
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,079
Mr. Choi Jae Jin.

594
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,479
Are you saying you instructed Vice-Director Oh Ji Eun...

595
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,389
to perform ghost surgery yourself?

596
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:46,789
Yes.

597
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:51,689
Vice-Director Oh only did me a favor.

598
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,199
And you will give up on your license to take responsibility?

599
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,829
Yes.

600
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:59,599
I have no right to be a doctor.

601
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,039
Ghost surgery isn't the only reason.

602
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,179
I turned a blind eye on bleeding patients.

603
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,059
(1 year later)

604
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,569
As the voice recording was revealed...

605
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,009
after 29 years since the case was closed,

606
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,209
the real culprit...

607
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,439
of the late Director No Sun Ho's embezzlement case...

608
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,210
was found to be Chairman Hwang Kyung Ju.

609
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:55,590
(Prison Ground)

610
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:10,269
(If you have hope, you can start again.)

611
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,250
What brought you here? I said nothing would change.

612
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,679
- You could've refused to come. - I refuse.

613
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,149
Too bad. It's no use.

614
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,760
I'm in charge of counseling the prisoners here now.

615
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,659
- What? - So...

616
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,300
let's take it easy. You're going to see me anyway.

617
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,268
Why? Why did you quit your successful clinic?

618
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:38,929
Are you worried about me?

619
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,868
You ruined my successful life.

620
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,768
That was all because of you!

621
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:45,210
Do you have an intermittent explosive disorder?

622
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,280
You raise your voice habitually.

623
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,440
I can get angry too, you know.

624
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,909
What...

625
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:56,849
Okay.

626
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:58,989
I will...

627
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,989
get the counseling.

628
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,590
But let me ask you one thing.

629
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,090
Go on.

630
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,960
Did you really try to save Lee Se Na?

631
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,269
Why?

632
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,070
She harassed you so much.

633
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:18,169
She wanted to be loved and accepted by her family.

634
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,039
That alone wasn't a sin.

635
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,449
Maybe I wanted to let her know that she deserved to be loved.

636
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,789
I couldn't save Lee Se Na.

637
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,559
But I'm going to save you.

638
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,159
Look.

639
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
It's such a beautiful world.

640
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,000
You shouldn't lock yourself in from it.

641
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:56,579
Why don't you start studying again?

642
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,150
You're good at math.

643
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,920
I am.

644
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,389
Aren't you tired?

645
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,119
Hi.

646
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:38,820
- Hello. - Hello.

647
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,319
(Shelter for Abandoned Dogs, Dodam Dodam)

648
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,789
There you go.

649
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,888
(Shelter for Abandoned Dogs, Dodam Dodam)

650
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,530
Let's go in.

651
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,569
- Sir. - What is it?

652
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,130
It was rescued today.

653
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,199
I see. Let me see.

654
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,269
Come. How old is it?

655
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,650
I'm glad you're here.

656
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:07,449
You aren't abandoned. Okay?

657
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:17,230
So Yi, what time is it in Korea?

658
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:19,389
It's 11am.

659
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:22,030
Why aren't you going home?

660
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,929
I just left the library.

661
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,969
I'm going to head home after this call.

662
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:28,369
Hi, So Yi.

663
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:31,238
What the... You guys are always together.

664
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,479
Of course. When are you coming?

665
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,178
When I go there, will I have a place to sleep?

666
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:36,949
Our house is spacious enough.

667
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,309
Are you sure you're coming next month?

668
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,050
Yes. That's why I'm working hard even now.

669
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,250
I'll call you again later.

670
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,789
Let's go.

671
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,000
Hi, Ra Kyung.

672
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,530
- It's already lunchtime. - Soon.

673
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,069
You will get really busy.

674
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,239
Where are you?

675
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:03,099
Me? I'm at a bookstore.

676
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:07,609
I want to help Oh Tae Hwan start studying again.

677
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,609
When will you stop doing that prison counseling?

678
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,209
If the store goes under, you might have to run your clinic again.

679
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,150
The fortune-teller said it'd go successful.

680
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,218
Is So Yi doing well?

681
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:19,819
Yes. Thanks to her pretty looks,

682
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,289
we have a lot of boy students.

683
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,928
Oh, right. The fortune-teller said...

684
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,658
you should head to the east.

685
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:30,300
You'd find someone valuable for you there. I'll call you later.

686
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,400
- Hello. - Hello, Kyung Tae.

687
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,300
- The same order as always? - Yes. Thank you.

688
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,739
- Hello. - Hello.

689
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:44,709
- I bought coffee for you. - Thank you.

690
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,448
- Goodbye. - Bye.

691
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:47,848
- Bye. - Goodbye.

692
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:50,619
Is the director busy again today?

693
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,089
You know a lot of patients want her to perform their surgery.

694
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,090
Goodness. I'm worried she might collapse at this rate.

695
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,759
She'll be done with surgery and come out soon.

696
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,199
Really? Oh, right.

697
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,799
- Have some sushi. - Thank you.

698
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,500
Thank you.

699
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:12,809
Honey.

700
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,480
You must be tired.

701
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,649
You said you were busy.

702
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,719
I always have enough time to see you.

703
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,090
What is it this time, Young Min?

704
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:32,190
I'm just looking after my sister who lives alone.

705
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:35,800
That doesn't sound like my brother at all.

706
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:36,969
Yeong Won.

707
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:41,070
What do you still take me for? You know so well about me.

708
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,039
I have an idea to suggest.

709
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,678
What do you say to a counseling table in our store?

710
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,510
You can counsel customers like tarot readers in coffee shops.

711
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,479
Young Min. I don't want to give you any more beatings.

712
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,050
Just focus on running the business.

713
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:57,920
What?

714
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,889
She hung up on me. Darn.

715
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,960
But it's a brilliant idea. I can't believe she said no.

716
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,300
Are you crying?

717
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,599
Young Min.

718
00:57:10,369 --> 00:57:11,799
Don't we have any days off?

719
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,869
Why? Are you tired already?

720
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:16,069
Have you forgotten?

721
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,339
Look, punk.

722
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,308
You were full of complaints...

723
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:22,109
when your uncle went around without even opening the restaurant.

724
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,549
That's because he hardly kept it open.

725
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,779
That's not it.

726
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,078
You had passion.

727
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,118
You were desperate to serve your noodles to customers.

728
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,959
That desperation and passion.

729
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,460
Where has that passion gone?

730
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,960
That passion?

731
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,529
- Passion. - Passion.

732
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,569
Okay. I will work hard to make the noodles.

733
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,329
- There you go. - Yes.

746
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:47,260
My family members all looked confused...

747
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,030
by my announcement.

748
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,500
Right. It wasn't an announcement made by someone else.

749
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,368
It's understandable how they would be surprised to hear this...

750
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:56,909
from someone who was obsessed about having...

751
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,809
a happy family.

752
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,710

finally feel relieved by this sight?

754
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:07,348
My family members who stood in front of the house...

755
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:09,519
looked at our house for one last time.

756
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,149
Like a spirit being released...

757
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,289
from the cage that has been keeping us trapped,

758
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,260

("La Vie Est" by Jeong Mi Jo)

761
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:24,099
I decided not to tell my family where I was headed.

762
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,570
I was grateful for their consideration...

763
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,110
of not asking where I was going.

764
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:36,340
I am covered by an endless range of snowy mountains.

765
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,320
The wind is dancing between me and the mountains.

766
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,050
There must be a certain distance for the wind to dance.

767
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,018
Now, the refreshing wind...

768
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:50,730
will dance between me and my family.

769
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,799
Free from expectation and obsession,

770
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,760
it will move freely out of love...

771
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,300
as we face each other from a distance.

I can't believe you found me.

776
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,590
I'm quite surprised.

777
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,658
You didn't even tell Jae Jin where you were staying.

778
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:03,099
Having to be taken care of as his mother...

779
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:06,000
I don't want to pressure my own son into that.

780
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,139
I felt a bit disappointed.

781
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,010
The two of us...

782
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,909
shared a sense of comradeship.

783
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,480
You're right about that.

784
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:25,119
We'll just think we've scattered now that the war is over.

That short but intense moment.

788
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,070
Those dreadful times...

789
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,639
have given us an opportunity.

Right. You said this...

793
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,789
after reading this when you were young.

01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:02,460

796
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,630
You remember that?

797
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,000
You were so smart.

798
01:02:13,469 --> 01:02:14,739
You see,

799
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:20,340
I misunderstood my obsession for the family...

800
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:23,409
as if it was...

801
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,150
a sacrifice for the family.

802
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,650
I also...

803
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,919
didn't want to break that fantasy...

804
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,719
that our family was perfect.

805
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,690
Now that time has passed,

806
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:42,929
I don't get why I stuck onto that so much.

807
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:48,139
A home is not a place but the people who put it together.

808
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:51,110
But Mother,

809
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,480
it would've been hard to decide...

810
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,440
to be away from the family.

811
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:00,550
You surprised me once again.

812
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,650
I have a bit more experience, you see.

813
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:08,960
You still have a long way to go.

814
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:12,428
You aren't preparing for another war with me, are you?

815
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,659
No.

816
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,570
Didn't you know that I was a pacifist?

817
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:20,670
Oh, really?

818
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,199
That's unexpected.

819
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:29,340
When you feel lonely,

820
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,709
come to us whenever you want.

821
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,880
Our family...

822
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:35,550
is in a different form now,

823
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,389
but it hasn't disappeared.

824
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,150
Sa Kang.

825
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:48,130
Do you want to see what I've found?

826
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,599
Flowers have bloomed...

827
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,800
even in the snow.

828
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,769
Oh, hello.

829
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:08,179
You won't be short of any corn guksu here.

830
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,219
What a relief.

831
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:24,800
Dr. No.

832
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:28,940
We were still great partners.

833
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,239
Shouldn't it be in present form?

834
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,039
We must be the only mother-in-law and daughter-in-law...

835
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,440
who help each other out like this.

836
01:05:04,469 --> 01:05:07,070
Is your family well?

837
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,250
The problem is what the standard...

838
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:13,409
of being "well" is.

839
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,079
Have I not trapped that standard of being "well..."

840
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,320
with words like happiness, harmony,

841
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:22,590
and perfection?

842
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,630
I finally get it.

843
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:30,059
There is no such thing as a broken family.

844
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,329
There are just bad expectations.

845
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:37,769
Our family has decided...

846
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:40,610
to be free from those bad expectations...

847
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:43,280
and practice being strangers.

848
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,650
I believe in this.

849
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:49,650
Love will not end...

850
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,489
even though our family is separated.

851
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:56,159
And if anyone asks...

852
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,760
if my family is well,

853
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:03,429
I can answer that question...

854
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,400
feeling a lot more lighthearted.

855
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:26,590
Slipping down...

856
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,519
wasn't so bad.

857
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:35,559

858
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,860
(We thank Jung Woong In for his cameo performance.)

859
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:58,270
(Thank you for watching Bitter Sweet Hell.)
