1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,009
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,009
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,178
Gosh, I poured too much water.

5
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,910
(3 days ago)

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,720
Remember.

7
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:17,059
You can never beat No Yeong Won in a mind game.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,859
You rushed over at once and got yourself arrested.

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,390
Shut it.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm going to show her how thoughtless she was.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,529
She's probably acting up...

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,870
because she thinks her son's secret is a pregnancy.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,140
I told you we should just expose it.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,439
Why are you having me wait for my turn...

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,579
even by tutoring her son?

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,880
We can just expose it soon...

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,479
and make a mess out of her son.

18
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,218
Just to imagine her struggling...

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,320
with her wrecked son,

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,950
I'm thrilled.

21
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,490
You're too selfish.

22
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,530
Did you forget?

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,758
The end of No Yeong Won...

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,700
should be satisfying for us all.

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,000
You just hardly have a sense of empathy.

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Hey. I detest it when someone says that about me.

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,280
You see,

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,339
I can't really relate to your ideas.

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,679
We should expose it to the public...

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,980
and see her suffer.

31
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,750
Isn't that faster and more accurate?

32
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,849
It's more fun to stir up her imagination.

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,329
One's imagination is most frightening of all.

34
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,599
"Will my family's secrets be exposed to the world?"

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,359
"If then, what will happen?"

36
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,599
She will suffer in the swamp of imagination.

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,569
We're going to keep torturing her...

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,239
and make her cave in on her own.

39
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,819
Hold on. Darn it.

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,219
- What is it this time? - Goodness.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,760
Tae Oh, I confessed it to my mom.

42
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,260
She said she'd protect me.

43
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,230
Couldn't you keep him in better control?

44
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,500
Gosh, whatever. I'm just going to expose it.

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,210
You don't know how to play games.

46
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,210
Wait.

47
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,849
I'm going to set up another plan.

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,419
You want me to wait again?

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,449
When can I stop waiting?

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,830
Did you forget about the past?

51
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,930
If you keep bothering me,

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,900
I'll get rid of you like a piece of cake.

53
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,000
You're aware of that, right?

54
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,620
Se Na.

55
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,159
Se Na?

56
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,659
You're here.

57
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,120
Mr. An?

58
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,899
Who did you think installed a secret camera in their house?

59
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,800
Why didn't you tell me?

60
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,399
All right.

61
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,170
The timing is perfect...

62
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,410
because he recently got fired.

63
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,610
He's commendable, you see.

64
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,550
He didn't say anything about me to the police.

65
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,149
Why didn't you...

66
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,120
tell me that Mr. An was a spy?

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,290
He's not our business anymore.

68
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,790
He's going to die anyway.

69
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,600
Take this.

70
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,959
What...

71
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,869
Die?

72
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,509
I came up with a better idea.

73
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,750
A butler attacks No Yeong Won...

74
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,579
to take revenge on her for firing him.

75
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,149
No Yeong Won loses her temper...

76
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,689
and kills him by accident.

77
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,659
Maybe I should write a detective novel.

78
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,259
Hold on. Are you saying...

79
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,699
you'll frame No Yeong Won for murder?

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,229
She's resisting,

81
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,329
so we have to force her to give in.

82
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,040
In order to clear herself,

83
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,470
she'll have to reveal everything and give in.

84
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,410
She'll become a mess on her own.

85
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,620
Se Na.

86
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,850
I keep telling you. That woman...

87
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,519
can withstand becoming a mess herself.

88
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,889
What tortures her more...

89
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,559
is to see her family break down.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,759
Must I tell you more?

91
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,170
What the... Why...

92
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,160
You know it, right?

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,230
Our purpose is to take revenge on No Yeong Won.

94
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,029
Trust and follow me this time again.

95
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,639
Why didn't you hand this to me?

96
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,180
No.

97
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,319
I'm going to take her down this time.

98
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,370
How will it be if the world finds out...

99
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,068
about your family's secret?

100
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,540
(Hong Sa Kang)

101
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,870
I'll give you an hour.

102
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,659
It's giving me the creep.

103
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,600
What's wrong with...

104
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,029
(Moon Tae Oh)

105
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,600
The person you have reached is unavailable.

106
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,740
Why that little...

107
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,659
I should've gotten rid of him a long time ago.

108
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,559
(Hong Sa Kang)

109
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,750
This is Gangnam Police Station.

110
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Yes.

111
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,120
The real culprit?

112
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,720
- Yes. Tell me the details. - What is it about?

113
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
Right.

114
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,428
I asked you what it was about.

115
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,360
The real culprit of the murder case in Yangpyeong's vacation home...

116
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:25,960
Hello?

117
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,600
Hello?

118
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,100
(Gangdong-gu, Gilgaon-ro 160, Building 2, Room 905)

119
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,799
You should've been obedient.

120
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,559
I think we found the real culprit.

121
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,960
Hold on.

122
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,559
Take a look at this.

123
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,570
It's crazy here. Goodness.

124
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,039
You should check this out.

125
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,539
Just a moment.

126
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,909
(Tenant: Oh Tae Hwan)

127
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,139
It says the tenant is...

128
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,149
a man in his 20s named Oh Tae Hwan.

129
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,250
Do you think he has something to do with Lee Se Na?

130
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,319
Oh Tae Hwan is Moon Tae Oh.

131
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,750
Do Hyun's tutor.

132
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,659
What? That Moon Tae Oh?

133
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,029
Take this.

134
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,289
I think he ran off already.

135
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,700
Okay. I'll have him wanted quickly.

136
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,029
No.

137
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,299
I know a way to lure him in.

138
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
(No Yeong Won's son)

139
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,649
You were right.

140
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,750
My mom won't accept me.

141
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Come here and save me.

142
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,960
Hello.

143
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,129
You're here.

144
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,440
Yes. What about Do Hyun?

145
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,009
You are from Yangju Cathedral's orphanage.

146
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,809
You pretended to be Moon Tae Oh of Korea National University.

147
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,049
You're Oh Ji Hwan's older twin brother,

148
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,350
Oh Tae Hwan.

149
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,460
How long have you known Lee Se Na?

150
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,700
You found out.

151
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,970
That's why you lured me in here...

152
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,269
by using Do Hyun.

153
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,840
You were at the vacation home with Lee Se Na that day,

154
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,840
weren't you?

155
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,009
What are you talking about?

156
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,950
On the day when the murder took place at the vacation home,

157
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,879
a man tussled with my mother-in-law.

158
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,090
I know it was you.

159
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,889
Do you have proof that it was me?

160
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,899
Are you doing this...

161
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,169
because of what happened 16 years ago?

162
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,779
I remember.

163
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,379
Your twin brother looked just like you.

164
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,679
Your mother was covered with bruises.

165
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,590
I thought you'd come again.

166
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,919
So I just let you go.

167
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,929
You just let us go?

168
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,629
Is that how you remember it?

169
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,610
You're mistaken.

170
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,649
You just let us go?

171
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,230
You should've just let us go...

172
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,629
instead of running your mouth!

173
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,870
This is all because of your thoughtless words.

174
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,590
No!

175
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,840
Die!

176
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,549
Jae Jin.

177
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,620
Let's go in.

178
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,820
Where do you think you're going? No. Come here.

179
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,789
Come here.

180
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,929
Young Min!

181
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,669
Darn you...

182
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,669
- You can't go. - Get off me.

183
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,309
Young Min, are you okay?

184
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,909
No.

185
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,590
- You little... - Gosh.

186
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Let go!

187
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,159
- This punk. - You're not going anywhere!

188
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,029
- Hold him. - Let go!

189
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,369
Let me go!

190
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,470
Give up, you punk!

191
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,170
This is the police.

192
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,769
Let me go!

193
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,880
- Let go! - Give up, you punk.

194
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,950
Arrest him already!

195
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,180
Darn...

196
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,420
(Chapter 11: Small Embers Anywhere)

197
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:41,930
It's nice to meet you.

198
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,299
Hello.

199
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,068
I'm Gu Kyung Tae, Oh Ji Eun's boyfriend.

200
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,140
- Oh, I see. Hello. - It's good to see you.

201
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,509
- Mr. Choi. - Yes?

202
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,250
Ji Eun...

203
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,950
- Let's talk later in private. - Sure.

204
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,288
Gosh. We arrested him thanks to you.

205
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,789
But it was too dangerous.

206
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,259
I had no time to come up with another way.

207
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,528
Well, he's resisting without saying anything.

208
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,000
But the bloodstained clothes and even the knife were found.

209
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,940
He probably won't last long.

210
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,869
Your mother will be able to go home.

211
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,838
She won't be completely cleared...

212
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,549
from the suspicion, though.

213
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,349
I see.

214
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,819
Did you look into what I asked?

215
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,390
Oh Tae Hwan's twin brother.

216
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,859
Oh, yes. But...

217
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,990
he died a long time ago.

218
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,059
All the family died...

219
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,460
except for Oh Tae Hwan.

220
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,269
As expected, his situation is similar to Lee Se Na's.

221
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,309
Let me try talking to him.

222
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,949
Will you be okay? Won't it be dangerous?

223
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,150
It'll be okay.

224
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,750
Go on that way.

225
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,000
Won't it be dangerous?

226
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,608
If it gets dangerous, I'll go in right away.

227
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:30,710
Okay. Well...

228
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,740
Right.

229
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,819
You think your family broke down...

230
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,549
because of me, don't you?

231
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,559
Why did you do that?

232
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,690
I...

233
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,099
thought your parents were the issue.

234
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,299
I simply told her...

235
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,670
what was more urgent...

236
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,869
in order to treat your brother.

237
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,640
Every night, I wondered...

238
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,180
what would have happened...

239
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,450
had you not said such an irresponsible comment.

240
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,150
Every night since the day all my family died.

241
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,109
Break them all.

242
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,809
What's wrong?

243
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,779
Come on.

244
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:49,289
- Stop it. - Stop what?

245
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,119
This is enough!

246
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
She said it was all your fault.

247
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,589
Did that woman say so?

248
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,299
You went there just to hear nonsense.

249
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,028
Is this my fault?

250
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:04,429
Yes, it's because of you. It's your fault.

251
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,538
Don't abuse our children.

252
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,269
You have no right to talk about our children!

253
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,710
Darn you.

254
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,210
- You... - It's your fault.

255
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,549
It's all because of you.

256
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:17,970
Mom...

257
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,880
If you hadn't...

258
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,118
said such a thing that day...

259
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,519
If Mom hadn't tried to kill Dad, this wouldn't have happened...

260
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,660
to my family.

261
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,299
I want to make you feel it so badly.

262
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,269
The pain...

263
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,470
of watching your family...

264
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,339
falling apart. I want to make you feel that.

265
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,210
Yes.

266
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,509
The pain you went through.

267
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,349
I'll never be able to understand it.

268
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,980
But...

269
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,849
thinking that happened because of me is wrong.

270
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,529
My decision about telling her to get rid of her violent husband.

271
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,529
I'd still give her the same advice.

272
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,200
What makes you so confident?

273
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,579
You think you're always right?

274
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,779
You think your answer is always correct?

275
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,710
I'm asking you.

276
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,980
You think you're correct?

277
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,489
You don't know what kind of pain I dealt with.

278
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,990
That's why we...

279
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,788
want you to fall apart.

280
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,389
It's too dangerous. I'm telling her to get out of there.

281
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,430
Wait.

282
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,259
"We?"

283
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,268
Are you talking about Lee Se Na?

284
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,329
No.

285
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,140
The patients you abandoned.

286
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,400
Everyone...

287
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,108
who is destroyed because of you!

288
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,180
You know the situation you're in,

289
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,380
yet you're covering up for Lee Se Na?

290
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:06,480
She planted all the evidence in your house,

291
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,490
which means she abandoned you.

292
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:10,890
Think carefully.

293
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,230
Lee Se Na brainwashed you too.

294
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,430
No. That's not true.

295
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,929
No! That's never true!

296
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,970
Why not me? Why Lee Se Na?

297
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,769
Don't touch me!

298
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,160
Are you okay?

299
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,299
Don't listen to what that prick said.

300
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
How can they do this to you? This is outrageous.

301
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,640
His family had horrible death in front of him.

302
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,969
No wonder he blames me.

303
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,839
I know I'm in no place to say this,

304
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,979
but doctors should have cognitive empathy toward patients...

305
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,910
rather than emotional empathy.

306
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,420
You said that to me.

307
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,920
Don't let your emotions blur your decision.

308
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
You did what you had to do.

309
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,829
They became unfortunate because of their wrong parents.

310
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,329
How is your wound?

311
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,470
It's fine.

312
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,839
It was dangerous.

313
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,489
While Dr. No Yeong Won's mother-in-law was arrested...

314
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,490
for murder,

315
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:57,129
another suspect was arrested...

316
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,529
resulting in a big impact.

317
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,298
The police said they found...

318
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,969
many pieces of evidence with the victim's DNA...

319
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,969
in the new suspect's house.

320
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,709
They also hinted a possibility of manipulating the case...

321
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,439
by getting Dr. No Yeong Won's mother-in-law,

322
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,979
Hong Sa Kang involved...

323
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,740
based on the new suspect's text messages.

324
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,479
As a result, Novelist Hong Sa Kang requested the review...

325
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,949
of legality for confinement.

326
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,318
The police announced that they will investigate her...

327
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,950
without detention for now.

328
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,369
- I'm sorry. - Mom.

329
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,298
- You had a hard time. - I'm sorry.

330
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,669
Oh, hey.

331
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,710
- Oh, you're out. How do you feel? - It must've been tough.

332
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,970
- It was so unfair. - I missed you so much.

333
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,180
Are you here alone?

334
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,930
You had a hard time, Mother.

335
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,660
Yes.

336
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,269
Let's go home.

337
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,609
It reminds me of the time...

338
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,119
when we drove along the coast...

339
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,180
in Tongyeong.

340
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,529
I drove so fast,

341
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,099
so you held my hand tightly.

342
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,069
Why did you drive so fast?

343
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,069
This is nice.

344
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,309
Do you want to check out the sea for a second?

345
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,450
- Shall we? - Yes.

346
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,589
Do you remember the video you filmed me?

347
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,758
You filmed me while playing hide-and-seek.

348
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,160
Of course I do.

349
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,730
We were playing hide-and-seek that day.

350
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,440
The day I found out the truth for the first time.

351
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,879
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven,

352
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,549
ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.

353
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,789
Ready or not, here I come.

354
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,630
Come out

355
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,230
Wherever you are

356
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,069
Jae Jin?

357
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,410
Jae Jin?

358
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,079
Where are you?

359
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,539
My Jae Jin.

360
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,380
Jae Jin?

361
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,980
Come out

362
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,180
Wherever you are

363
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,720
Come out wherever you are

364
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,059
Come out

365
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,230
Wherever you are

366
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Turn it off.

367
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,740
What are you doing?

368
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,799
Jae Jin isn't here.

369
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,039
I told him he'll be in trouble if he plays in my library.

370
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:31,539
He's probably upstairs.

371
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,879
Speaking of which, let him play outside.

372
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,150
Why do you always keep a boy inside the house?

373
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,750
Hide-and-seek? Seriously?

374
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,319
Don't you know the yellow dust is serious outside?

375
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,690
Don't you know my Jae Jin has weak bronchial tubes?

376
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,630
"My Jae Jin?"

377
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,670
Don't act like you care about him when he's not even your child.

378
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,970
You're too obsessed.

379
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,309
How can you act like that when you can't have a baby?

380
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,480
You're mental.

381
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,130
Olly olly oxen free

382
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,000
Jae Jin.

383
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,000
Olly olly oxen free

384
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,109
Jae Jin.

385
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,059
Mom!

386
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,409
Oh, my baby.

387
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,970
My son.

388
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:13,210
Sorry.

389
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,460
Why didn't you tell me all these years?

390
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,499
I guess I didn't want you to abandon me.

391
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,200
How can you say that?

392
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,170
I'm sorry, Jae Jin.

393
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,079
Mommy's sorry about everything.

394
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,240
No.

395
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,319
Perhaps I made a decision that day.

396
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,049
To play innocent...

397
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,789
and live as your son until I die.

398
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Son.

399
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,740
Until you bloomed,

400
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,509
I wanted to be your strong sun.

401
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,980
I didn't realize I was burning.

402
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,549
With a burning heart,

403
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:35,119
I finally look at the white moon outside the bars.

404
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,400
I will be your soft moonlight.

405
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:43,069
I will be the night sky...

406
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,869
that quietly embraces you who shine brightly.

407
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,210
So,

408
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,139
don't look back or collapse.

409
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,279
But remember...

410
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,410
you are the first and the last...

411
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,450
shining light in my life.

412
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,069
Jae Jin.

413
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:20,569
Jae Jin.

414
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,429
Grandma.

415
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,229
You must've gone through a lot.

416
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,639
My dear grandson, thank you.

417
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,869
- I love you. - Me too.

418
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,139
Madam Hong.

419
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:35,849
Welcome back.

420
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:39,949
Sa Kang!

421
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,789
Sa Kang. Goodness, Sa Kang.

422
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,190
All right.

423
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,429
I'm so sorry for your trouble.

424
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,289
I get it, so knock it off.

425
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,800
Come on.

426
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:57,768
I prepared a dinner to welcome you back.

427
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,669
- Let's go in. Let's all go in. - Okay.

428
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,768
Let's go.

429
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,809
Ta-da.

430
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,840
Go on in.

431
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,519
- Please take a seat. - All right.

432
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:14,479
(Congratulations on Your Release)

433
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,190
It sure feels like a release party.

434
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,989
It's really like a party.

435
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,789
Is this to tease me?

436
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,459
No.

437
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,059
They say you need to have tofu when you're released from prison.

438
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,010
All right, family.

439
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:41,340
I'd like to give thanks to my family...

440
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,980
for worrying about me.

441
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,750
Dr. Choi.

442
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,980
Dr. No.

443
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,849
And especially, Do Hyun.

444
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:54,190
My gosh. Did you just call her Dr. No?

445
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,260
Goodness. Yeong Won, you got promoted.

446
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,299
I'm in the middle of talking.

447
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,400
Okay.

448
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,839
Thank you, Young Min, for coming all the way...

449
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,469
to congratulate me on my release.

450
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:11,669
And my sister-in-law,

451
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,510
for preparing such a decent dinner for the family.

452
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,510
Thank you so much.

453
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:21,679
Let's put all our past grudges behind us,

454
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,920
and for this beautiful moment today,

455
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,359
let's all have a toast.

456
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,590
- Toast. - Toast.

457
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,300
Sa Kang. Family is the best, right?

458
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,169
The other day, it felt like you and Jae Jin...

459
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,199
would cut ties for good.

460
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,139
I guess you reconciled.

461
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,809
You don't reconcile with your family.

462
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,940
I'm sorry about the other day.

463
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,078
Aunt. You too, Young Min.

464
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,479
You know they say...

465
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,179
a family is a group of people with a lot to apologize for.

466
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,489
Don't they have just too much to apologize for?

467
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,969
You better apologize first.

468
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,000
Me?

469
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,010
Sa Kang.

470
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,409
I'm sorry.

471
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:25,780
I didn't mean anything bad.

472
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,150
Mother, try some of this pan-fried tofu.

473
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,590
It looks good.

474
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,460
Thanks for the food, Aunt. It looks delicious.

475
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,429
Thanks.

476
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,299
Let's all enjoy it.

477
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,799
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

478
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,369
Let's enjoy it.

479
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,070
I'll enjoy it.

480
00:37:58,179 --> 00:37:59,219
Hey.

481
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,820
Thank you for everything, including my mother's matter.

482
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,360
Don't mention it.

483
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,190
You went through a lot too.

484
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,369
What is it?

485
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,469
I have something to tell you.

486
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,610
The truth is...

487
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,539
Now my heart drops just to hear that introduction.

488
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,880
Hurry up and say it. What is it?

489
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,210
The truth is...

490
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,559
I'm not my mother's birth son.

491
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,299
What are you suddenly talking about?

492
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,369
She didn't give birth to me.

493
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,130
I don't know who my birth mother is.

494
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:56,369
- Are you sure about it? - Yes.

495
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:58,840
I found it out a long time ago.

496
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,309
Mother doesn't know...

497
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,579
that you're aware of it, does she?

498
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,849
I happened to tell her.

499
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,920
The day before the vacation home incident.

500
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,440
- Are you okay? - Yes. I feel unburdened.

501
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,699
Would it sound weird to put it this way?

502
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,309
No. It's understandable.

503
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:35,909
Your mother must be very shocked.

504
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,019
Is it because I was released from prison?

505
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,760
It tastes sweeter.

506
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,159
It must've been hard.

507
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,530
It must've been hard for you to get Oh Tae Hwan too.

508
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,400
No matter how much they hated you,

509
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,639
they shouldn't have pulled this horrible scheme.

510
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,110
You're right,

511
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,079
but to know what his family went through,

512
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,579
I wonder if I was right about my judgment...

513
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,448
and feel guilty.

514
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,949
You seem so tender-hearted at a time like this.

515
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,859
There are all kinds of patients in this world.

516
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,159
What matters is you did your job based on your conviction.

517
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,969
Jae Jin told me.

518
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,309
I admire you...

519
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,480
for what you did.

520
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,250
When I met him for the first time,

521
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,150
he held my hand tightly...

522
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,590
and wouldn't let go.

523
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,559
I just couldn't...

524
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,329
let go of that tiny hand.

525
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,170
Maybe this is what people call a fate...

526
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:08,670
between a mother and a child.

527
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,980
At first, I hid him from everyone...

528
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,579
and acted like I was pregnant.

529
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,250
Faking my belly to grow bigger,

530
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:25,449
I played pregnancy for months.

531
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,860
But strangely,

532
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,058
it felt like Jae Jin was actually growing...

533
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,300
inside my womb.

534
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,400
You tried to protect him.

535
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:44,039
You're admirable.

536
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:46,980
Dr. No.

537
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,210
He certainly was the only glint of my life.

538
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,420
Maybe that makes me more obsessed with him.

539
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,429
You seem so tender-hearted at a time like this too.

540
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,329
No.

541
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,030
This isn't the time for us to get all sentimental.

542
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,670
Let's see.

543
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,309
- Dr. No. - Yes, Mother?

544
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,579
What are you waiting for? Come help me out.

545
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,249
(Hong Sa Kang's Detective Note)

546
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,820
Mother. When did you do all this?

547
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,429
According to your reasoning,

548
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,929
it was Oh Tae Hwan...

549
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,428
- who tussled with me, - Right.

550
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:43,969
but Lee Se Na was the one who plotted...

551
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,699
to dump the blame.

552
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,199
Lee Se Na must've reported it to the police.

553
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:52,268
She put the whole blame on Oh Tae Hwan.

554
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,440
It means she wants to play the last game with me.

555
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,610
She murdered An Yo Sub, her assistant,

556
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,449
and cut ties with Oh Tae Hwan.

557
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,050
Based on her pattern so far,

558
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,559
she always found someone to assist her around us.

559
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,789
So we have to be careful with our surroundings.

560
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,199
We must make Oh Tae Hwan confess about Lee Se Na as soon as possible.

561
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,699
Oh Tae Hwan looks just fine.

562
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,738
I can't believe he tutored our Do Hyun...

563
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:27,980
for such a shady purpose.

564
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,479
From now on, be very careful...

565
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,449
when you hire someone for our family, Dr. No.

566
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,618
Mother. Jae Jin is the one who hired Oh Tae Hwan.

567
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,989
He even lied that he was his senior's son.

568
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,889
Really?

569
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:53,570
That was when Dr. Choi was being deceived.

570
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,038
"He's a passionate young man who likes George Orwell," you said.

571
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,869
You were quite fond of him.

572
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:00,839
I did?

573
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,779
As far as I remember, you heard he won an Olympiad...

574
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,380
and recommended that he talked to Do Hyun.

575
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,550
Did I?

576
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:12,889
You have such a good memory.

577
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:15,659
Do you take any pills for your brain or something?

I'd like you to take it over.

I don't need the clinic.

Leave?

- Oh, that. - Why?

Is it impossible because Madam Hong came back?

590

Have you decided to move back in with them?

some things to take care of regarding my family.

613

I approached Choi Jae Jin...

614
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,070
only to take revenge on No Yeong Won.

under the name of family and used your noble intention.

624
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:23,539
Still, you never were greedy even for once.

625
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,539
You were the one who did the surgery,

626

but Choi Jae Jin took all the credit.

627

but Jae Jin married No Yeong Won.

629

You didn't desire anything.

Mr. Choi Jae Jin. And his hospital's vice director,

649
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,339
Ms. Oh Ji Eun has exposed this security camera footage...

650
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,939
along with the fact that she performed ghost surgery...

651
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,509
due to his mother,

652

Ms. Hong Sa Kang's demand.

653
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,849
Vice-Director Oh, could you elaborate this?

654
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:47,349
I was...

655
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,150
brainwashed by Ms. Hong Sa Kang...

656
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,860
ever since I was little.

657
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:01,199
She sponsored me for a long time.

658
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,558
("Military Monster")

659
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,698
So I felt like I had to do what she said.

660
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:05,800
But it was...

661
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:08,369
for her son...

662
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,170
and her family.

663
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,980
She sent me to med school in order to make her son a doctor.

664
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,949
She made me perform ghost surgery.

665
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,419
It's almost like she slaved you.

666
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,488
- Right. - Weren't there any moments...

667

when you thought this was wrong?

668
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:30,960
Every time I felt guilty,

669
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,030
she blinded me under the name of family.

670
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,099
She used my weakness of being an orphan...

671
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:41,500
and tried to have me under control.

672
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,768
She said I needed her acceptance...

673
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:45,739
to be accepted as part of the family.

674
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:47,809
She thoroughly...

675
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,210
brainwashed me.

676
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,420
Goodness.

677
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,750
Scandals arise nonstop about my sister's family.

678
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,860
Is this true?

679
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,920
The ghost surgery part is true.

680
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,689
Jae Jin recently confessed it.

681
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,129
("Vice-Director Oh Ji Eun Sounds the Alarm...")

682
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,828
("to the Society Full of Power Abuse")

683
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:09,730
People love exposures too much.

684
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,300
She's turned into a hero in an instant.

685
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:16,070
But Ms. Oh shouldn't do this.

686
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,269
Hey, Young Min.

687
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,710
A weird idea just crossed my mind.

688
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,480
- What is it? - Could my uncle...

689
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,219
be brainwashed too?

690
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:30,690
She isn't that kind of lady.

691
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,530
Hey.

692
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,360
I don't think he's brainwashed.

693
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:41,659
He seems to be in love.

694
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,800
That's even more frightening.

695
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,809
Are you okay?

696
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,849
I'm ready to take your order.

697
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,989
(Ms. Oh Ji Eun reveals that...)

698
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,690
Is this the truth about our family?

699
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,090
Have we been admired as a doctor family...

700
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,659
when we actually had someone perform ghost surgery?

701
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:17,928
- Do Hyun. - I had no idea.

702
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,599
I was just proud of my dad.

703
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,199
I feel so ashamed of it.

704
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,269
You must be disappointed in me.

705
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,280
I'm sorry.

706
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,179
The truth is, I am...

707
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,079
scared of seeing blood.

708
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,320
So I couldn't become a doctor.

709
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:41,190
It's all my fault.

710
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,260
Then, you shouldn't have done any of this.

711
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,760
You're an adult. Can't you choose that much for yourself?

712
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:47,500
It was all my doing.

713
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,099
I made your dad a doctor.

714
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,570
And I made Ms. Oh perform ghost surgery.

715
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,769
It's all my fault.

716
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,409
I'll take responsibility.

717
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,079
No.

718
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,880
I want Dad to take responsibility now.

719
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,619
This is all my fault.

720
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,590
- I'll handle it. - No, Mother.

721
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,329
You did all that for me.

722
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,170
Like Do Hyun says, it's my fault for I made the wrong choices.

723
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,339
Hi, Ra Kyung.

724
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,539
Yeong Won.

725
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,150
Something's strange.

726
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,849
Media companies were informed that we'd hold a press conference.

727
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,119
What press conference?

728
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:47,190
That you'd make a stance...

729
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,059
about Oh Ji Eun's exposal.

730
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,499
When is that going to be?

731
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,900
At 6pm today.

732
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,730
And I received a package just now.

733
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,639
It doesn't say anything about the sender again.

734
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,949
(Read what I wrote.)

735
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,099
I am a hypocrite.

736
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,799
I gave solutions to other families' problems...

737
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,369
as if it was a piece of cake.

738
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,598
But I busily tried to hide...

739
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,369
my own family's problems.

740
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,739
Everything Ms. Oh Ji Eun said...

741
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,340
is true.

742
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,289
What can be worse than this?

743
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,389
Oh Ji Eun's exposal...

744
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,860
is part of Lee Se Na's plan too.

745
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,230
Why on earth is she taking this far?

746
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:05,199
Yeong Won. We can call off the press conference.

747
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:09,840
Don't tell me you're going to do as you're told?

748
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,309
You're going to reveal yourself that this family is a complete mess?

749
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,809
Ms. Kim.

750
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,179
I'm sorry. I couldn't control myself.

751
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,250
Let's just speak the truth.

752
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:21,750
Dr. Choi.

753
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,919
Well, what could go wrong with revealing...

754
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,590
our family's secrets at this point?

755
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,459
Being threatened by a person like her...

756
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,259
and having to do as she tells us to do...

757
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,499
is what hurts my pride.

758
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,730
That is why this mustn't happen.

759
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,669
Yeong Won. I will cancel it right now.

760
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,840
If you do,

761
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,309
she will reveal Do Hyun's video right away.

762
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,840
Is she using me to threaten us?

763
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,719
- I'll just reveal it myself then. - No.

764
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,150
Why not?

765
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,849
I thought you all understood and respected me.

766
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,320
Are you afraid about others knowing about it?

767
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,730
It's not like that, Do Hyun.

768
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,829
The things that might happen after that...

769
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,899
might be a lot tougher than we think.

770
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,199
You said this yourself.

771
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,939
You said that it wouldn't matter whatever others think about it...

772
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,670
if the family does not feel ashamed of it.

773
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:19,239
You told me not to be afraid.

774
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:25,980
So...

775
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,550
don't make any deals with that person because of me.

776
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:36,559
No. I can't let that happen.

777

Yeong Won.

778
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:47,070
Do Hyun.

779
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,969
Let's give your mom some time.

01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,480
I will not be afraid of any form of threat from now on.

841
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,289
It is because I have learned that family is more precious...

842
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,989
than the acceptance of others.

843
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,829
No matter how much damage we will take,

844
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,800
I want to protect this family.

845
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,239
I agree...

846
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,570
that I easily talked about other family issues...

847
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,840
but wasn't honest...

848
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,679
about my own family.

849
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,780
I will ask for forgiveness...

850
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,250
from those who felt upset during my sessions.

851
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:01,659
I will accept criticism for the things I have done wrong.

852
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:07,159
Even I have to put everything on the line,

853
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:11,170
I wish to make things right.

854
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,469
This is why we have decided to reveal the blackmailer...

855
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,940
and the true culprit of the vacation home murder.

856
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,178
- What? - What?

857
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:22,779
- The true culprit? - What?

858
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,179
The true culprit?

859
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,619
- What was that? - The true culprit.

860
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,718
(Lee Se Na)

861
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:35,289
Who is that? It's her?

862
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:36,559
Lee Se Na.

863
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:39,058
Including the detailed and obsessive blackmailing,

864
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,429
she has committed murder against an innocent person...

865
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:43,969
in order to frame me as a murderer.

866
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,868
She is a brutal criminal.

867
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:47,638
- It's a girl? - What?

868
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,999
She looks so young too.

869
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,539
She was born in 1994 and is currently 29 years old.

870
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,710
She was raised in Gangneung.

871
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,509
She was the only survivor and suspect of arson...

872
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,650
of the 2009 family fire incident.

873
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:03,320
She was adopted into a family in Norway and returned in 2015.

874
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,549
She was involved in an insurance fraud...

875
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,190
after all three of her husbands died.

876
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,629
(Lee Se Na, born October 14, 1994, currently 29 years old)

877
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,760
(Raised in Gangneung)

878
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,630
I will...

879
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,670
put everything I have on the line...

880
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,039
and catch Lee Se Na.

881
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,039
So...

882
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,179
please help me...

883
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:30,550
catch this criminal.

884
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,029
That's incredible.

885
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,130
("No Yeong Won Reveals Blackmailer's Identity")

886
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,630
How can this even happen?

887
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,429
Does this even make sense?

888
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:10,589
Are you saying the person in that photo you have revealed...

889
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,788
is the true culprit of the vacation home murder?

890
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:14,389
Do you have any evidence that she is the culprit?

891
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,360
How long have you been threatened?

892
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:48,759
- You had a long day. - I'm back.

893
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,789
Welcome back.

894
01:04:57,269 --> 01:04:58,329
Hey, So Yi.

895
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,639
Is Do Hyun back home?

896
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:04,038
He said he was going to the restroom and disappeared.

897
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,339
And I can't reach him.

898
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,440
Is that so?

899
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,510
I'll try contacting him. Thanks for letting me know.

900
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:13,750
Did Do Hyun come back home?

901
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:16,550
No. He hasn't returned yet.

902
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,429
- What's wrong? - Hold on.

903
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:37,170
Do Hyun. Where are you? Why aren't you answering your phone?

904
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,569
- So Yi... - You should've protected him...

905
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:39,769
before he was ruined.

906
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:54,090
Where is Do Hyun?

907
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,260
If you touch my Do Hyun,

908
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:05,969
I will kill you.

909
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:18,110
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

910
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,380
Lee Se Na!

911
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,238
Any nonsense from you...

912
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:52,510
and your son will experience the loneliest death in the world.

913
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:55,819
We must hurry! We have to find Do Hyun!

914
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,518
Lee Se Na is starting a game with us.

915
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,419
Why did she use the word "lonely?"

916
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,218
The loneliest place for Lee Se Na is her house.

917
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,988
Your parents-in-law who killed your dad and fooled you,

918
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,429
your fake husband,

919
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,860
and your son who lied to you! Why?

920
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,368
I'll end things for you.

921
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:13,368
Bring back my Do Hyun!

922
01:07:13,369 --> 01:07:15,698
Live in the pain of killing your own son.

923
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,809
You will never be free from me.
