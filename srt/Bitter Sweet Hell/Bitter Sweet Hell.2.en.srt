4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,450
We will now announce the Doctor of the Year Award.

5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,880
This year could be a more special award ceremony.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,720
As you all know, we have a married couple as our co-recipients.

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,050
We will announce them now.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,890
In the Psychiatrist category, Dr. No Yeong Won.

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,890
In the Plastic Surgery category, Dr. Choi Jae Jin. Congratulations.

(Doctor of the Year, 2023 KDA Awards)

11
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,450
We sincerely congratulate both of you.

12
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:49,989
I've checked,

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,819
and this is the first time that a married couple...

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,859
is receiving the award at once.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,758
We must hear how you feel.

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,859
Dr. No Yeong Won.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,060
You can go ahead.

18
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,770
No, you can go first.

19
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:02,869
You go first.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,409
Yes, well...

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,209
I'm not exactly sure how this happened.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,650
I don't know if I'm worthy enough to receive this award,

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,819
but I will continue to work hard...

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,219
to treat patients and help people throughout my life.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,890
And until I received this award, she has stood by my side...

26
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,200
to give me so much help and teach me as well.

27
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,799
My beloved...

28
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,170
Dr. No Yeong Won.

29
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,040
I'd like to thank her for this award.

30
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,269
Thank you.

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,209
As we've heard, he is such a loving husband.

32
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,179
Then, Dr. Choi Jae Jin's...

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,348
spiritual leader and teacher,

34
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,179
and the doctor who's taking charge of the mental health of Korea,

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,119
Psychiatrist No Yeong Won. We can't miss out on hearing...

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,319
how she feels, can we?

37
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,090
I also feel so grateful.

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,390
I always feel that I'm lacking,

39
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,560
but I will try even harder...

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,699
to become a doctor who can fill...

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,469
the empty spots that patients may have.

42
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,340
To my husband,

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,439
who did so much to support me from my side,

44
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,050
Ms. Hong Sa Kang,

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,620
and the person who would have been...

46
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,120
happier than anyone else to see this. Father.

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,360
To Father, who cherished me like a daughter,

48
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,629
I would like to dedicate this honor.

49
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,460
(Psychiatry: No Yeong Won, Plastic Surgery: Choi Jae Jin)

50
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,098
Personally,

51
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,168
when I listen to Dr. No's counseling and solutions,

52
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,080
it all seems to end with family.

53
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,050
Then, what does family mean to Dr. No?

54
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,550
To me, family is...

55
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,590
a lifeline.

56
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,388
A lifeline?

57
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:06,389
Yes.

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,889
It's where the true No Yeong Won exists...

59
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,199
and the strength that gets me back up.

60
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,699
Without family,

61
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,500
I would not be here today.

62
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,800
That is why family is...

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,169
the one thing that I must fight for until the very end.

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,150
Protecting my family so that it doesn't fall apart...

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,210
is my life...

66
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,719
and the reason for my existence.

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,889
(Doctor of the Year, 2023 KDA Awards)

68
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,889
Oh, my.

69
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,160
What do you think you're doing, Ms. No?

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,430
Mother, I have something to tell you.

71
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,439
Tell me? Right now?

72
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,509
What's so important that you're going this far?

73
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,750
What is it?

74
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,790
You remember how my father passed away, don't you?

75
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,970
I do. He died in vain.

76
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,370
The case that my father was involved in...

77
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,810
I think he was framed for everything.

78
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,110
And I think...

79
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,279
Father played a part in doing so.

80
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,819
"Played a part?"

81
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,448
I do remember that Prosecutor Choi was...

82
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,060
was in charge of the case on Director No.

83
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,029
Don't beat around the bush, and just tell me.

84
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,069
Prosecutor Choi,

85
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,069
take care of Director No.

86
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,040
And you have to join us in Hwang Ju Group.

87
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,209
But sir,

88
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,648
he's such an upright person.

89
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't think Director No will just sit back and take it.

90
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,519
That is why we must get him involved...

91
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,089
with this sexual harassment case for sure.

92
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,889
Yes, then,

93
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,628
you mean that the secretary will give a false statement...

94
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,129
that she was sexually harassed by Director No, right?

95
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:39,860
But sir,

96
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,669
that female secretary must clearly do her part.

97
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,699
You know this, right?

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,740
Of course.

99
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,839
All right.

100
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,939
We'll give it a try.

101
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,379
This guy is a pain in my behind even in death.

102
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,790
How could Father...

103
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,060
take part in framing my dad?

104
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,660
And then, he brought me into this family...

105
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,769
Mother, did you perhaps know?

106
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,439
Is that what matters to you now?

107
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,639
What?

108
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,610
So, what do you want to do, Ms. No?

109
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,779
Will you report this to the police?

110
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,980
Or will you reveal this to the world?

111
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,379
I understand. You must want to kill him.

112
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
But, Ms. No... He's dead.

113
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,490
Director No is already gone too.

114
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,889
Whose apology do you want at this point, and for whom?

115
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,730
Think rationally.

116
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,158
So, I should just pretend not to know...

117
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,200
and just cover it up and let it all go?

118
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,539
You're too emotional today. You're unlike yourself, Ms. No.

119
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,409
What's important is...

120
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:00,409
what you can gain from having this secret revealed.

121
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,019
Fine.

122
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,750
What would I do when they'd all passed away?

123
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,090
Still, at the very least,

124
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,259
wouldn't I be curious to know whether the remaining family...

125
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,960
knew about this fact?

126
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,100
As you already know, that man and I...

127
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,100
were not in any relationship where we'd share this kind of secret.

128
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,539
Also, it's not that I can't understand how upset...

129
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,279
and angry you feel right now.

130
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,879
I've spent my life despising Prosecutor Choi too.

131
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,980
But you need to think carefully about this.

132
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,120
Saying that your father-in-law, a man the whole world knows,

133
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,758
is the culprit who drove your father...

134
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,460
to commit suicide?

135
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,158
Then, what do you think people would say of you...

136
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,628
when you didn't even know about that...

137
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,429
and joined that family as their daughter-in-law?

138
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,970
No, everything you've accomplished until now...

139
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,500
Will you be able to let all that go?

140
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,929
I know how you feel.

141
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,600
How long have we spent together in this house?

142
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,129
Why wouldn't I know?

143
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,269
But what's important here...

144
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,539
is not revealing the truth...

145
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,809
but the well-being of our family. Don't you think?

146
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,878
With this one truth,

147
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,980
think about what will happen to our family.

148
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,990
Think about what you need to protect, Ms. No.

149
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,690
The choice is up to you.

150
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:21,519
(Chapter 2: A Downright Lie)

151
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:28,529
It's such a blessing to spend this kind of time every morning...

152
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,259
with your family.

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,470
It doesn't mean you're a family just because you eat together.

154
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,639
It's important to have such emotional communication.

155
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,740
What do you think, grandson?

156
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,049
It's suffocating.

157
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,230
Amen.

158
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,329
Good. Now that we've said amen, let's all start eating.

159
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,370
Sure.

160
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,649
It's braised pomfret.

161
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,620
Father used to enjoy having braised pomfret.

162
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,360
Honey, come on. I didn't braise it for this.

163
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,129
He loved having braised pomfret.

164
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,928
- Housekeeper. - Yes?

165
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,299
- I'm having toast instead. - Yes, madam.

166
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,570
I apologize, Mother.

167
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,919
Honey, are you okay?

168
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,330
Yes.

169
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,730
Did you feel the same...

170
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,029
when your father passed away?

171
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,440
I realized...

172
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,980
what the word "sudden" meant.

173
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,679
After my dad passed away,

174
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,919
I was swept with a sense of longing suddenly from time to time.

175
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,220
I bet you're going through the same thing.

176
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,429
You're right.

177
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,960
How are you hanging?

178
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,669
Of this whole family, your father adored you the most.

179
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,700
Do you think...

180
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,470
you knew everything about your father?

181
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,080
Why do you ask?

182
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,309
No.

183
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,019
I'm just asking.

184
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,950
I didn't know much about him.

185
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:14,929
Honey.

186
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,628
It's true my parents weren't on good terms,

187
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,330
but the way I see it, she's greatly shocked.

188
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,700
Why else would she have mentioned the biscuit box?

189
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,570
It seems to me...

190
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,109
that she's acting brightly...

191
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,110
to get over her grief like a defense mechanism.

192
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,080
I don't think so...

193
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,590
Be more attentive to her for me.

194
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,690
Sure.

195
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,960
- Bye. - Bye.

196
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,600
Ms. No.

197
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,940
Yes, Mother.

198
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,109
Could you get me a glass of lemonade?

199
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,839
I'll get you some cookies too.

200
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,149
No, Ms. No.

201
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,279
Buicuits sound better.

202
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950
Sure.

203
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,360
("Beast's Yesterday")

204
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,028
It's super boring.

205
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,158
The writer probably has no friends.

206
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,798
Friends don't talk to each other like that.

207
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,169
This is trash.

208
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,169
Reading this novel just ruined my afternoon.

209
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,969
Your sentences show that you have no talent for writing.

210
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,580
Don't waste your efforts, and look for another job.

211
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,610
She's not like that.

212
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,350
What do you know, jerk?

213
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,879
You could get a scolding for this, jerk.

214
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,080
"Sandglass."

215
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,490
Ms. Hong Sa Kang, are you having fun in secret?

216
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,299
What the... Does this person know me?

217
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,919
Doctor.

218
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,960
How did it go?

219
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,460
The operation went successfully.

220
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,130
- Thank you. - Thank you, doctor.

221
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,670
Thank you.

222
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,809
Can he get all better now?

223
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,480
Well, the thing is... His condition...

224
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,249
He's been very focused,

225
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,949
so let me explain it on his behalf.

226
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,619
The operation went successfully.

227
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,289
It did,

228
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,518
but Yoo Joon is only a little kid right now.

229
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,358
As we watch him grow,

230
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,660
he'll have to go through operations and treatments in stages.

231
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,960
Don't worry.

232
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,669
The doctor has agreed...

233
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,299
to provide the rest of the treatments for free.

234
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,940
Thank you, doctor.

235
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,909
Thank you. Oh, my.

236
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,508
- Thank you. - Thank you.

237
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,539
Sir.

238
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,730
Toast.

239
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,279
Let me pour a glass for my father-in-law too.

240
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,150
(No Sun Ho rests here.)

241
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,779
Ms. No.

242
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,319
Isn't Dr. Choi a decent husband...

243
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,660
and a tender-hearted son-in-law?

244
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,329
They were close friends when they were alive.

245
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,029
They're resting side by side even after they died.

246
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,400
Your father...

247
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,839
faced such a futile death at a young age.

248
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,619
Go Myeon.

249
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,919
My brother wasn't the kind of person who would die like that.

250
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,289
- Hello, Aunt. - Hi.

251
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,559
There's no way he will rest in peace...

252
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,029
after how futilely he died.

253
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,069
Goodness. How could he get slammed by a rock to death?

254
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,139
What was the use of exercising...

255
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,069
and taking care of his health all his life?

256
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,910
He got slammed by a rock to death!

257
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,809
Exactly.

258
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,390
I came because it was his 49th-day death anniversary.

259
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,849
You prepared just this wine?

260
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,390
And nothing else for the service?

261
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,319
We go to church.

262
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,930
I see. You go to church...

263
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,359
and commemorate his 49th-day death anniversary.

264
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,369
Where's Do Hyun?

265
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,140
He...

266
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,368
He went to school.

267
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,470
His grandpa's 49th deathday is more important than school.

268
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,410
Jae Jin.

269
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,149
Can't you instruct your son better?

270
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,150
Look.

271
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,279
The right word is "educate."

272
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,619
I like the empty grave here.

273
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,219
- Son. - Yes?

274
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,319
When I die,

275
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,328
bury my body next to my brother right here.

276
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,559
It's expensive, Mom.

277
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,460
- Very expensive? - Yes.

278
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,599
How much is it per burial plot here, Sa Kang?

279
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,640
- Jae Jin, let's go. - Sure.

280
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,548
I know you've bought a few plots here.

281
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,348
Why don't you buy this whole section for family use?

282
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,819
I bet my brother saved...

283
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,319
quite a lot of money.

284
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,190
Don't you know how he spent his income?

285
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,828
Let all those women buy the empty plots...

286
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,130
next to Prosecutor Choi.

287
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,000
You can ask them for one.

288
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,640
Goodbye.

289
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:13,710
Darn that...

290
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,079
Relax.

291
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,459
She's too tiring for someone to live with.

292
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,529
Don't you agree?

293
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:34,769
No, Aunt.

294
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,200
Yeong Won.

295
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,539
My brother adored you so much.

296
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,069
They say a daughter-in-law is the love of a father-in-law.

297
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,109
Did you hear about this novel?

298
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,609
What novel?

299
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,150
So you don't know.

300
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,288
According to my son, rumors are rampant on the Internet...

301
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,660
that your mother-in-law was the one who killed your father-in-law.

302
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,829
That he died exactly as it is written in her novel.

303
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,369
You know your mother-in-law isn't an ordinary woman.

304
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,369
Be careful.

305
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,069
One of her novels might be about killing her daughter-in-law.

306
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Oh, please.

307
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,079
Yes.

308
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,009
You see, I'm not joking.

309
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,779
Look for it thoroughly before you regret it.

310
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,419
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

311
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,420
Bye.

312
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,528
Ra Kyung, I'm on my way now.

313
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,599
Yeong Won, did you get the analysis data?

314
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,440
- Oh, right. Let me grab that first. - Okay.

315
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,109
Now, come here.

316
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,990
My.

317
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,089
You're such a good painter.

318
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,490
Why are you now holding hands with Mom here?

319
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,829
I meant to hold her hand.

320
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,500
That's weird.

321
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,569
Well, look, Ga Young.

322
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,710
Mom's nails look like a witch's nails.

323
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,750
Do you know the biggest fear...

324
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,380
among kids Ga Young's age?

325
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,119
They're afraid of hurting their moms.

326
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,890
So they'd lose their moms' love.

327
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,029
So children...

328
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,670
soon hold their parents' hands again even if the parents let go.

329
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,869
Children's forgiveness...

330
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,710
saves adults from their guilt.

331
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,400
("And Then I Was Left Alone")

332
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,660
(The culprit put his hand against his nose.)

333
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,849
Do you think you can find out?

334
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,420
We only deliver it.

335
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,890
We can't identify the exact information of the sender.

336
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,129
Even if there's no sender,

337
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,328
we're obligated to deliver it...

338
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:32,528
as long as the receiver's information is correct.

339
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:33,960
- Okay. - Here.

340
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,940
One second.

341
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,069
Is there a way to find out?

342
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,569
Aren't you Dr. No Yeong Won?

343
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,180
Well...

344
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,450
I think she is Dr. No Yeong Won.

345
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,349
Ma'am, can we meet for a second?

346
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,539
You must be surprised.

347
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,970
But I have to say I was surprised too.

348
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,079
Because he was never like this before.

349
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,778
Of course, there are kids...

350
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,749
who give up on their exams.

351
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,380
Due to the pressure of going to university.

352
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:27,949
But Do Hyun...

353
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,049
Did he come back after he left during the exam?

354
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,160
He didn't come back on the same day.

355
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:35,859
But what worries me more is...

356
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,730
that he was back the next day as if nothing happened.

357
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
I don't know what is wrong with him.

358
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,170
He worries me.

359
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Hey.

360
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,539
Hurry up.

361
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,240
- Hey. - Over here.

362
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,749
- Hey. - Pass.

363
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,849
- Good job. Keep going. - Watch out.

364
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,750
- Block him. - Over here.

365
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,920
(Soft Hands)

366
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,809
Thank you for your patience.

367
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,009
Don't mention it.

368
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,779
You should fill yourself up first with a warm meal.

369
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,220
I'm...

370
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,759
here to ask you for a favor.

371
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,460
I've been waiting.

372
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:47,500
I will have to tidy up first.

373
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,269
Son.

374
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,940
Can I ask why you did that?

375
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:02,779
I'm sure you have your reasons.

376
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,680
I'm not scolding you.

377
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,650
I want to find the reason together.

378
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,519
Fine.

379
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,890
You can tell me later.

380
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,500
I believe there is a reason...

381
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,299
for every decision you make.

382
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:27,470
As long as you can be responsible for your decision,

383
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,869
I will always support you.

384
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,509
You know that, right?

385
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,258
I'm home.

386
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,500
Ms. No, come here for a second.

387
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Yes.

388
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,869
How was your day? Where's Do Hyun?

389
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,240
I think he's tired.

390
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,609
Ms. No, I heard you met Tae Oh before.

391
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,150
Oh, yes.

392
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,980
Hello, Dr. No.

393
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,220
He asked me to come for dinner at his house.

394
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,829
Ms. No.

395
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,960
Tae Oh turns out to be an elite.

396
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,869
He's a passionate young man who likes George Orwell's novels.

397
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,670
Honey, is Do Hyun okay?

398
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,240
Yes, he's okay.

399
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,539
What's wrong? Something happened to my grandson?

400
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,909
He must be under stress because of math.

401
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,109
If you don't mind,

402
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,049
can I meet him?

403
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,750
And to say hi?

404
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,150
Yes. That's a good idea.

405
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,759
I heard you won the International Mathematical Olympiad.

406
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,460
- Yes. - Is that okay with you, honey?

407
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
What?

408
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,230
I'll be quick.

409
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,319
I thought he should say hi to our family.

410
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,849
When you said you were going to Do Hyun's school,

411
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,789
I thought it'd help Do Hyun to have a brother like Tae Oh.

412
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,089
I know that you like people,

413
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,200
but I'm worried about you bringing strangers home.

414
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,099
You don't need to worry about that.

415
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,029
Do Hyun seems to like him too.

416
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,240
Speaking of which,

417
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,710
why don't we ask him to tutor Do Hyun in math?

418
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,279
Did you say...

419
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,079
he's your high school friend's son?

420
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,549
Yes.

421
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,480
How come I don't know that friend?

422
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,920
You don't?

423
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:56,650
I doubt it.

424
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,420
Don't try to fool me.

425
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,119
Do Hyun seems to be hiding something from me.

426
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,559
You two have been getting on my nerves lately.

427
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,559
We wouldn't dare to fool you.

428
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,329
Everything is all right.

429
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,039
Good. You're doing great.

430
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,769
- Come here. - Next.

431
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,569
Come on.

432
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,750
See? They're already getting close.

433
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,819
Now, use your wrist to throw it.

434
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,890
The real game is what matters.

435
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,430
When you throw the ball,

436
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,430
it draws an arc.

437
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,399
What do you need to do...

438
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,000
to throw it in the direction you want at the speed you want?

439
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,268
Strain in the direction I want?

440
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,809
You know it.

441
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,180
Baseball and math are the same thing.

442
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,778
- Let's try it again. - Yes.

443
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:54,809
It's nothing hard.

444
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,980
- Come on. - In the direction I want.

445
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,819
It's the same as math. Hey.

446
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,289
Gosh. It's okay. It's fine.

447
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Mr. An.

448
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,569
Why are you suddenly playing baseball?

449
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,529
That's Tae Oh.

450
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,170
Hello. I'm Moon Tae Oh.

451
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,710
I'm An Yo Sub.

452
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,680
Let's go again.

453
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,449
I don't have the ball.

454
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,779
You must be pretty good at catch.

455
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,789
Shall we play again?

456
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,190
All right. Go slowly.

457
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,059
(Is your family well?)

458
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,009
Your next appointment is waiting. Ms. Lee Se Na.

459
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,279
You were very surprised that day, weren't you?

460
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,449
Yes, a bit.

461
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,449
Me too.

462
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,289
When you first came here,

463
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,090
did you come without knowing that he was my father-in-law?

464
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,630
Is that important to you, Dr. No?

465
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,440
It's true that I came as a patient wanting counseling.

466
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,639
Still, I have to ask.

467
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,639
What your relationship was with my father-in-law.

468
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,420
Should I say that I'm thankful?

469
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,019
Or should I say that I'm grateful?

470
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,530
I still get like this sometimes.

471
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,869
I think it'd be best to stop talking.

472
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,869
That is why I'm bringing this up,

473
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,809
but I think it'd be hard to leave out personal sentiments with you.

474
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,609
So, I will introduce you to another doctor.

475
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,719
No.

476
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,619
He's already dead anyway.

477
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:22,090
All I want is to get counseling from you.

478
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,309
Are they happy?

479
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,280
What are you doing right now?

480
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,150
Sorry.

481
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,119
I was just wondering if everyone was actually happy.

482
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,719
Life is short.

483
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,030
But it'd be too sad not to know that.

484
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,299
Ms. Lee, you must think...

485
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,530
that my family doesn't look happy.

486
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,269
What do you think, Dr. No?

487
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,239
Do you think you're happy?

488
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,309
You're the one who came here for counseling.

489
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,840
If you came here with the intention of provoking me,

490
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,709
I will decline.

491
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,050
You said this last time.

492
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,650
Just because they're family doesn't mean they have to know everything.

493
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:24,190
Is that really true?

494
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,889
Are humans...

495
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,960
such beings...

496
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,888
who can truly forgive...

497
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,059
and understand each other...

498
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,300
in the name of family?

499
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,340
Oh, right. Dr. No.

500
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,110
Isn't that so shocking?

501
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,550
Prosecutor Choi's death...

502
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,760
was exactly the same as Novelist Hong's novel.

503
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,158
(Patient's Chart, Name: Lee Se Na)

504

(Recipient: No Y. Won)

506
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,340
Dr. No.

507
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,409
I'm here.

508
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:02,050
Please add two sugars and one cream to my coffee.

509
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,719
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,429
My brother used to nag me so much not to eat too much sugar.

511
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,769
Your father-in-law was so meticulous about his health.

512
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:22,440
But what does that matter? He died in such vain.

513
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,339
Honestly speaking,

514
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,509
your mother-in-law only has her wealth from having a rich family.

515
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,448
The person who grew that fortune this much was my brother.

516
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:34,579
My brother had so many connections in politics and finance.

517
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,719
Gosh, but now that he's dead,

518
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:41,320
it's just like what people say. "One man sows and another man reaps."

519
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,760
Auntie, you didn't come here to talk about that, right?

520
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,868
("Murder in a Frame")

521
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:57,010
I doubt it really happened like how it was in the book.

522
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,980
But isn't it a fascinating coincidence?

523
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:06,018
If you look in there, it makes sense...

524
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:09,090
that Sa Kang's character gobbled up my brother.

525
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,690
You know how much your mother-in-law hated my brother.

526
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,760
Sure, it was my brother's problem that he cheated his whole life.

527
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,629
But she looked down on him so much.

528
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,199
How would a man have any affection?

529
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,098
You know this too.

530
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,868
Your mother-in-law has that odd look.

531
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,570
Of looking down on someone when she looks at you.

(Hong Sa Kang)

533
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,280
Isn't that so shocking?

534
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,510
Prosecutor Choi's death...

535
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,750
was exactly the same as Novelist Hong's novel.

536
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:47,559
Until then, I was a fan of Hong Sa Kang's.

537
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,959
No one can tell how human relationships...

538
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,099
might turn out.

539
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:55,659
Don't worry, Yeong Won.

540
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,400
- Why? - I looked into it,

541
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:01,099
and there wasn't any mention of you or me.

542
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:05,339
I mean, there was nothing about a daughter-in-law...

543
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,809
or a sister-in-law dying.

544
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:08,979
Come on, Auntie.

545
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,279
Why? I read it over again.

546
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,449
Just in case there was something about a sister-in-law dying.

547
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,820
Gosh.

548
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,159
But do you know what's even more surprising?

549
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,260
What is it?

550
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,460
Even in this book, the sister-in-law...

551
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,070
absolutely hates the main female character.

552
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,269
- Auntie. - Yes?

553
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,679
- Can I read this book? - Yes.

(Mount Woomyeon rockslide accidental death)

555
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,649
("Former Prosecutor General Dies Due to Rockslide on Mount Woomyeon")

556
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,118
This morning, former Prosecutor General, Choi Go Myeon,

557
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,190
was found dead at the bottom of the hiking trail at Mount Woomyeon.

558
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,259
Choi had gone on a walk with his dog early in the morning,

559
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,459
and it has been revealed that he died from being hit by a rock...

560
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,629
that suddenly fell while he was walking.

561
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,229
Police say that the recent rainfall...

562
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,729
caused the soil and rocks on the hiking trail to loosen,

563
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,499
leading to this accidental death in a rockslide.

564
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,908
They are currently investigating the detailed cause of the accident.

565
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:12,268
The rockslide accident, which was known as his cause of death,

566
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,439
is being questioned as to whether it was a simple natural disaster...

567
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,880
that led to an accidental death.

568
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,779
According to investigations, the hiking trail at the time...

569
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,249
was not weakened to the point that a rockslide could occur.

570
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,689
The police are looking into other possibilities for Choi's death...

571
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,460
("Murder in a Frame")

572
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,630
I was curious...

573
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,768
whether you could simply conclude...

574
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,399
that an accidental death by rockslide...

575
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,440
was a natural disaster.

576
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,139
He was so used to hiking in the mountains.

577
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,880
It's still hard to accept.

578
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,110
So why didn't you do an autopsy?

579
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,309
What do you mean, an autopsy?

580
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,018
I'm not really sure...

581
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:55,119
why you're questioning this at this point.

582
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,249
We clearly suggested that you could do an autopsy...

583
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,619
even if it was a death caused by a natural disaster.

584
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,159
It was your family that declined to do so.

585
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,389
We declined to do an autopsy?

586
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,030
Who did?

587
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,769
Hang on.

588
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,250
You can take a look at that.

00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
(Disagreement for Autopsy)

590
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,420
Ms. Hong Sa Kang signed it.

591
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,389
She's Mr. Choi Go Myeon's wife, correct?

592
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,969
The mountain where he ran around for decades...

593
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:51,070
was more like an even carpet than the flat ground itself.

594
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:55,280
Could he have slipped from the early morning rainfall?

595
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,010
Or could he have misstepped?

596
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,579
What could have gone wrong?

597
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,920
His body was slipping down.

598
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,820
No, a life doesn't end just like that.

599
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,630
He had always been confident that he was the one to end things.

600
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,730
Was there someone who laughed at his overconfidence?

601
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,469
A heavy rock slams right into his head.

602
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,840
If it wasn't an accident from a rockslide,

603
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,409
could someone have...

604
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,059
Mother, what are you doing there?

605
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:49,699
Well, it's the mountain behind my house. Can't I even go for a hike?

606
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,570
So, why did you just pop out from there?

607
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:56,869
I dropped my lighter.

608
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,840
And what about you, Ms. No? What are you doing here?

609
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,280
Are you perhaps suspecting me?

610
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:11,019
Do you believe the rumor that I may have killed that man?

611
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,289
You did hate him that much.

612
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:21,199
Even if he were alive, wouldn't someone have wanted him dead?

613
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,070
But Mother.

614
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,170
Why didn't you agree to do an autopsy?

615
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,539
I heard that the police officers suggested an autopsy just in case.

616
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,710
He was a sinful man. Even if he was murdered,

617
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,308
wouldn't it be better to tell the world...

618
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,349
that he got smashed by a rock?

619
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:12,780

("Beast's Yesterday")

622
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:20,319
I just got goosebumps. "Murder in a Frame" is said...

623
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,190
to write about the same death as how some prosecutor died.

624
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,860
That's an insult to the great art of literature.

625
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,130
I shall stop the beginning of this rumor.

626
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,510
Sandglass, this idiot, showed up again.

627
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:41,940
This idiot...

628
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,010
will show up until people like you are all gone.

629
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,579
What's your relationship with the writer?

630
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,250
I cannot forgive anyone...

631
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:53,619
for insulting the writer.

632
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,260
(It was the same as usual.)

633

Tae Oh got me this wine.

635
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,309
Try some.

636
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,190
- It's nice. - It's good.

637
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:33,230
What is it? Are you concerned about something?

638
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,969
The truth is,

639
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,380
I got a strange package a few days ago.

640
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,739
A package? What was it?

641
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,280
A stuffed headless pigeon and...

642
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,920
It must've startled you.

643
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,250
Who sent you such a thing?

644
00:46:58,519 --> 00:46:59,960
It had no sender's name.

645
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,230
I guess a lot of people are jealous here and there these days...

646
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,929
because you're on a roll.

647
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:10,670
It seems like they want you to fall rather than be praised.

648
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,869
I know.

649
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:15,170
You should also be careful just in case.

650
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:17,010
Okay.

651
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:19,940
I'm going to bed. I'm sleepy.

652
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,210
Oh, right. You're going to the colloquium tomorrow.

653
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,110
That colloquium has been going on for more than a year.

654
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,579
