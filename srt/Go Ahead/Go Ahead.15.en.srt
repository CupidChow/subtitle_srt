[English subtitles are available]

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,020
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,940
Episode 15

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,600
5 minutes ago, our crew

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
learnt from the call of the enthusiastic citizen

6
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,880
Grandma Li that

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
she seemed to

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
hear a baby's crying from a sewer

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,750
at the junction of Xiaguang Road

10
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,800
and Qingdao Road,

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
so we temporarily gave up

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,080
the interview at the vegetable market

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,210
and are rushing to the place where the incident happened via the shortcut.

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Doctors and the ambulance

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
have reached the scene.

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
Now the life of this baby

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
affects all of us.

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
The above is the report sent by the reporter Qi Mingyue

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,079
from the scene.

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,940
So tiring, Qi Mingyue.

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,440
Take a rest.

22
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh,

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm parched.

24
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,040
Here you are. Drink some water.

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,000
Thanks.

26
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,880
Your cell phone has been vibrating for a long time.

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,920
Thanks, Gu Feng.

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
You had not only carried such a heavy machine

29
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
but also carried my backpack for me.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Your backpack is not heavy at all.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,240
Back then,

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,760
I went to Tibet for a documentary.

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
In spite of that altitude of 4,000 kilometers,

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,200
I carried the camera and followed...

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,260
Gu Feng, I'm going to answer the call.

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,520
Hello, Ling Xiao, what's the matter?

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,360
When did Jianjian

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
have a boyfriend?

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,480
What?

40
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,200
Boyfriend?

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,360
Believe me.

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
I really didn't know it.

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,200
If I knew it,

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,320
I wouldn't conceal it from you.

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,650
Don't overestimate me.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll hang up soon.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,040
Why didn't I know

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
there is such a boy around her?

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,660
When did she have a boyfriend?

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,880
Is she cheated?

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,040
Anyway, it's really strange.

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,400
As an investigative reporter,

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
go to find it out now.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,560
Sorry, teacher.

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm really a little...

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,920
Busy, right?

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,760
Mrs. Sun,

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,560
it's been a year since Sun Nian transferred here,

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,160
but you never attended the parents' meeting

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,240
and even didn't become a member of our class group.

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,880
All parents are busy.

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,120
The reason why

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Sun Nian bullied female classmates

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,480
in the class is that

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
you parents were so busy with work

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,200
that you neglected family education.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes, teacher.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
You're right.

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I have nothing to say.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Mrs. Sun, go back.

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
Sun Nian, go back for your class.

72
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,480
Teacher, sorry. Sorry.

73
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,320
But you still need to

74
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,720
take care of my son!

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,280
Why do you look at me like this?

76
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
Did he share his photos with you?

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,480
No.

78
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,140
Don't you worry that his appearance,

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,180
his appearance

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,480
goes beyond your expectation?

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,560
It doesn't matter what he looks like.

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,159
What matters is the tacit understanding

83
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,080
of our souls.

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,280
I just

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,840
want to know

86
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
whether he can stimulate my creative inspiration

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,200
and offer me materials

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
when we get along with each other

89
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,820
in another relationship.

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,360
Miss Li,

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,760
you're dating

92
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,000
for inspiration?

93
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,760
Yes, this is my purpose.

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,360
However,

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,200
what kind of sparks we will produce

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,480
is still unknown.

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,380
I'm a little excited when thinking of it.

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,920
What an artist!

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,120
Experiencer.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,690
I'm flattered. I'm flattered.

101
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,560
I want to kiss you

102
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,450
and try my best to approach you,

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,960
till you

104
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560
drain me out of all my passion

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,490
and turn it into the sacrifice of love.

106
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,200
Only you

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,280
can put out my fire.

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,980
The fire in my heart

109
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
and hands.

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
What does "put out my fire" mean?

111
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
What fills his brain?

112
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Dirty jokes?

113
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,840
Pervert.

114
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,000
It's acceptable.

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,240
After all, boys

116
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
are full of fantasies about girls.

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
But on his Weibo,

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,120
there are many comments on death.

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
For example,

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,920
extinction is the eternal beauty of romance.

121
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,440
One of his previous works

122
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,570
is even a tribute to the death of Marat.

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
Li Jianjian.

124
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you sure his psychological status

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
has no problem?

126
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
It's very normal.

127
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,240
As a sculpture designer,

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,320
he has his own understanding

129
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
of beauty and life.

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,400
He also runs a studio?

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
He doesn't make assembly line products

132
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,200
but only makes artwork instead.

133
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
For auctions?

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,200
No.

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
They're only made for competitions but not for auctions.

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
He wants to

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,159
be a famous sculptor

138
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,240
whose works

139
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
are on display in the art gallery.

140
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,880
So, so he is idle?

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,300
Isn't this his job?

142
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,250
But he can't make a living by it.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,840
What does he live on?

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
Live off his parents?

145
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,800
How did you

146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,280
know such a man?

147
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,480
Don't you

148
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,140
have any questions about him?

149
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Why are

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
my brothers here?

151
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
I disagree.

152
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,120
Why didn't you stop Li Jianjian

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,040
from dating such a freak

154
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,500
who lives off his parents?

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't you have any questions?

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,840
Which aspect?

157
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,360
Li Jianjian's taste?

158
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,040
It's been 4 years since they knew each other

159
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,600
in the sculpture section of her college forum.

160
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,720
They're on good terms

161
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
and always talk about works as friends.

162
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,560
They also appreciate each other

163
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,159
and know that

164
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,560
they're in the same city,

165
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,890
but they have never shared photos.

166
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
Why did that man

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
suddenly woo Jianjian?

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,260
He fell in love with her after a long time.

169
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,760
Li Jianjian's work

170
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,960
was on display at the sculpture exhibition.

171
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
Li Jianjian attended the exhibition a few days ago,

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
and he must attend it too.

173
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,000
You mean,

174
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,130
they had met each other.

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,940
If they met each other,

176
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Li Jianjian didn't need to

177
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,140
conceal it from us.

178
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,080
So

179
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
he probably

180
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,040
had seen Li Jianjian

181
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
and was

182
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,640
satisfied with

183
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,960
Li Jianjian's appearance.

184
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,680
Then

185
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
he wooed her.

186
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,500
So he wooed her for her beauty?

187
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,150
Oh, no. Oh, no.

188
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,080
I planned to ruin their relationship

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,880
when they met each other before.

190
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,010
Just put it into practice.

191
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
Can we do it?

192
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
The trial operation of your coffee shop

193
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
will begin on Sunday, right?

194
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Yes.

195
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,860
Ask Li Jianjian to invite him.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
It's better for us to meet him together

197
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
than let them

198
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,880
meet alone.

199
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,640
In this matter, we

200
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
can't be passive.

201
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
Anyway,

202
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
I'll definitely

203
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,600
stop Li Jianjian

204
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,060
from being with such a man.

205
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,970
What medicine is it?

206
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
Vitamin A, B and carotene.

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
For daily health.

208
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,520
You live a fine life.

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
Welcome.

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,200
Now I really feel

211
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,840
He Ziqiu is so rich that

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
he spent much money

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,560
on opening such a good coffee shop

214
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,800
for you.

215
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
I also want a man

216
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
to open a coffee shop for me.

217
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
Shut up.

218
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,840
This coffee shop is not mine.

219
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,640
He is starting his own business.

220
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Boss, welcome.

221
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,480
What would you

222
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,210
and your friends like to drink?

223
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Can we be free of charge in the future?

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,680
Of course.

225
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,800
Now that Li Jianjian

226
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,600
is the boss here,

227
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
we're the boss' good friends.

228
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,920
It's unreasonable to charge us.

229
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,800
Then I will

230
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,460
often discuss business here.

231
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,680
The waiter is so handsome.

232
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,290
Take some photos of him now.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
It's nice.

234
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,970
It seems that both of you like here.

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,040
Just so-so.

236
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
I'm generally satisfied with it.

237
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,440
What's this?

238
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,120
Open it for a look.

239
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,880
This is an opening gift

240
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,840
I prepared for you.

241
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,120
Opening gift?

242
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Let me have a look.

243
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,080
It's so cute.

244
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,080
I often carve such a golden toad.

245
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,020
I wish you a prosperous business.

246
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,840
Thanks.

247
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,440
Ziqiu, can you make money by running this shop?

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,400
Of course.

249
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,920
If it's not profitable, I wouldn't open it.

250
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,680
Its transfer fee

251
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,640
and rent

252
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,000
should be high.

253
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,440
Moreover, given the initial investments

254
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
such as renovation costs, machinery equipment costs,

255
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,840
and the costs of employees,

256
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,520
utilities and ingredients after opening,

257
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
if its daily turnover

258
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
is less than 1,500 yuan,

259
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,360
it should be hard for you to make both ends meet.

260
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,640
It's almost the same as my cost accounting amount.

261
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,760
It is open today,

262
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,320
and many customers come,

263
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,800
so there should be

264
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,200
no problem in the future.

265
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,280
It doesn't matter. It's not important,

266
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,480
because you're rich.

267
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,840
Now I only wonder

268
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,600
when your

269
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
online boyfriend

270
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,920
can reach.

271
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,840
He is on the way. He is on the way.

272
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
Is this your first meeting?

273
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,050
Are you nervous?

274
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm a little worried.

275
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,440
We're all here. What are you worried about?

276
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm worried that he doesn't like me.

277
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,240
Hello, Ran, have you arrived?

278
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,480
Inspiration?

279
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,440
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

280
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Go back.

281
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,730
Come on. Come on.

282
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,320
What's wrong?

283
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,600
He was inspired on the way.

284
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,460
Then he went back to make a mud pie.

285
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
This is your first meeting,

286
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
but he went back to make a mud pie?

287
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,480
Inspiration is rare,

288
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,320
but I can meet him at any time,

289
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,000
right?

290
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,960
Now that he won't come,

291
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,120
let's eat cake.

292
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,440
Come on. Come on.

293
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
This cake

294
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,320
looks good.

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,660
Eat cake. Eat cake.

296
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,080
Ziqiu, this cake looks very good.

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,760
Take care.

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,170
Well, Jianjian,

299
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
I'll bring cake for you tonight.

300
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,800
See you. Bye-bye.

301
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,370
Bye-bye.

302
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,010
Let's go.

303
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,800
Jianjian,

304
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,080
I'll send you to your studio

305
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,880
and then...

306
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,040
No need. No need. No need.

307
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,800
You and Qi Mingyue

308
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,600
still need to do something, right?

309
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Just do it.

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,660
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

311
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

312
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,800
Let's go.

313
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,760
Qi?

314
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,880
Hello, Mr. Li.

315
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm the reporter

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
Qi Mingyue

317
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,920
of "Let's Help."

318
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,400
This is

319
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Mr. He, your current tenant.

320
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,560
It is said that

321
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,680
after I was entrusted

322
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
to negotiate with you

323
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
for renting your house

324
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,280
at Ruoshui Pure Garden

325
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
at a price of 3,000 yuan per month

326
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,840
and paid the deposit,

327
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
you rented it

328
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
to Mr. He

329
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,800
at a price of 4,000 yuan per month again.

330
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,320
No. No.

331
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,480
It's a misunderstanding.

332
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,360
Stop shooting.

333
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,220
Stop shooting.

334
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,850
Thank you today.

335
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
You're welcome.

336
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,900
It was just a piece of cake.

337
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,080
Treat me to a meal.

338
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,480
OK.

339
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Don't you like barbecue?

340
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,360
No, I have no appetite.

341
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
Are you unhappy?

342
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,960
No.

343
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,600
I just think that

344
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,780
there is a gap between Jianjian and me

345
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,410
and I can't see her through.

346
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
Don't take it too seriously.

347
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,690
She is just a little unused to your return.

348
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,320
We know Li Jianjian well.

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,240
Unlike the paper tiger

350
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
Tang Can,

351
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
she is like

352
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,040
a plastic tiger

353
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
at most.

354
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,440
She is really happy for your return.

355
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,720
But, after all, you had been parted for so long.

356
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,960
9 years.

357
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,680
Gosh.

358
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,480
I really didn't expect that

359
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,280
you even never came back.

360
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
When I left,

361
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
I didn't expect that

362
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,720
I couldn't come back for so many years, either.

363
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,360
My mom was

364
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,040
always mad

365
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,100
and in poor health,

366
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,210
so I couldn't leave her.

367
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Well,

368
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,480
now you live opposite,

369
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
so you can get along with her as before.

370
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,000
Moreover, I'll help you.

371
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,000
As long as you need,

372
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,920
ask me for help.

373
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,200
Keep an eye

374
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,720
on Jianjian

375
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
and her online boyfriend for me.

376
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,120
I doubt that

377
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
Ran didn't come on purpose today.

378
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,920
Maybe he wants to

379
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
meet Jianjian alone.

380
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,320
He is ill-disposed.

381
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Anyway, keep an eye on them more.

382
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,160
I see.

383
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,490
This is what I should do.

384
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
You just need to treat me to a few more meals

385
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,760
in return.

386
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,160
After all, I'll be her sister-in-law.

387
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,560
It's my duty to mediate between my husband

388
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,920
and my sister-in-law.

389
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
They come out. They come out.

390
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,840
Have they found the baby?

391
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,720
It's a cat.

392
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,520
After seeing your hand-painted manuscript of the hairpin,

393
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
President Long is very satisfied with it

394
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,920
and wants more styles.

395
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,280
OK, I'll think about it tonight.

396
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,920
Great.

397
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,250
It's just a false alarm.

398
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
It's so cute.

399
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,280
Why does she always hear a baby's crying

400
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
in the sewer early in the morning?

401
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,920
Please stay tuned

402
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,310
for "Let's Help——Approaching Science" tonight.

403
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Meow and baby's crying

404
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,640
are greatly different.

405
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,109
Grandma Li is hard of hearing.

406
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,069
Look at your look.

407
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,880
Your mom may

408
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,210
call to scold you again.

409
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,109
You doomsayer.

410
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,960
It's my fault?

411
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Lower your voice.

412
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
I'll answer it in my room.

413
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,740
I'll hang up 5 minutes later as usual.

414
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,160
Mom.

415
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Qi Mingyue,

416
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,120
I've watched

417
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,720
the latest episode of your program.

418
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,320
I had told you many times that

419
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,680
you must pay attention to your image

420
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
as a TV reporter.

421
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,160
Make yourself up

422
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,880
and tidy your hair before going out.

423
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,240
Our relatives and friends watch TV every day,

424
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
but you're ugly

425
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,440
on TV.

426
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,520
Mom, I really did as you required.

427
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,880
But it was hot. When my hair was messed up, I...

428
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,480
You can use more hair spray.

429
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,600
Is it hard to check it

430
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,400
through the reflective glass

431
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,360
before recording?

432
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
Sometimes, at the scene, we...

433
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,320
It is not a battlefield.

434
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you have no time

435
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,720
to make yourself up?

436
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,050
Don't defend yourself.

437
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
I tell you this for your own good.

438
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,360
Mom, I was wrong.

439
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,600
I won't do so again.

440
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,000
I should have forced you to take

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,880
the college entrance exam again for your failure

442
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,040
in filling in the answer sheet in the first college entrance exam.

443
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,600
As a result,

444
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
you were admitted to the Department of Journalism

445
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,640
of a local university.

446
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,440
Well,

447
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,440
as a TV reporter

448
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,960
of a local TV station,

449
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
you're even not

450
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,400
an authorized reporter.

451
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Mom, it's a past thing.

452
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
Don't mention it.

453
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,680
OK, don't mention it.

454
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,920
You've grown up,

455
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,400
so I can't criticize you.

456
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,080
What's your decision

457
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,160
on the civil service exam

458
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,290
I mentioned before?

459
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,580
I haven't decided yet.

460
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,760
Mingyue,

461
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
I don't hope that you can make a lot of money

462
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,920
and great achievements.

463
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,320
You are my only child.

464
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,240
I just hope you

465
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,880
have a stable job,

466
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,720
marry

467
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
a suitable man

468
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,720
and have a child.

469
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,720
We just

470
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
want you to lead a safe

471
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,010
and smooth life.

472
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,800
Mingyue, time for dinner.

473
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
OK. Coming.

474
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,120
Mom, Tang Can asked me to have dinner.

475
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
It's so late,

476
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,120
but you haven't had dinner.

477
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,520
Jianjian came back late.

478
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,960
Li Jianjian is back?

479
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
Well, I want to talk with her.

480
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
OK. Wait a moment.

481
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Li Jianjian.

482
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Li Jianjian,

483
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,120
my mom wants to talk to you on video.

484
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,600
Hurry up.

485
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,460
Please. Please. I'm begging you.

486
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,640
Hello, Ms. Jin.

487
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
Hello, Li Jianjian.

488
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,960
I've watched the exhibition of your works

489
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
at the age of 17.

490
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,880
I think

491
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,480
your concept

492
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,640
of three close friends are the best.

493
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,880
Really?

494
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Thanks. You have good taste.

495
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,560
Sure.

496
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,760
Jianjian, you need to

497
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,760
persuade Mingyue as her friend.

498
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
She isn't as talented as you are.

499
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
She isn't a young girl.

500
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,640
She has to settle down.

501
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,400
Civil servant will be her best choice,

502
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
which will make me and her dad

503
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,120
rest assured.

504
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,040
OK.

505
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,960
I see, Ms. Jin.

506
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,930
That's good.

507
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,000
One more thing.

508
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
You should

509
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,320
have dinner early,

510
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,520
or it'll be bad for your health.

511
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,480
You're young.

512
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,880
It'll be terrible if there's something wrong with your stomach.

513
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,160
Look. Your face becomes thin.

514
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,400
No.

515
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,660
I'm still over 100 jin.

516
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,280
I'll make delicious food and send it to you

517
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,210
a few days later.

518
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Really? Thank you auntie.

519
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,000
We're going to

520
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,280
have dinner now.

521
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,600
OK, go.

522
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,660
Enjoy your dinner.

523
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,080
See you.

524
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
Bye-bye.

525
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
Luckily, I'm not excellent enough

526
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,880
to answer Ms. Jin's call.

527
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,420
To answer your mom's call,

528
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
one has to battle mental barriers,

529
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,440
keep smiling all the time

530
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,240
and be

531
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,800
able to make

532
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
improvised stories.

533
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,560
A talk with your mom

534
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,360
will make a great actor.

535
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,200
She would be very happy

536
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
if Li Jianjian were her daughter.

537
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,200
Why does your mom still ask you

538
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,440
to take the civil service exam?

539
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,640
Didn't you make it clear to her?

540
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,960
Will that help?

541
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,360
Just let it be.

542
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,000
You can't fool around like that.

543
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,120
You have to fight.

544
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,240
Not everyone dares to

545
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,880
fight against his parents like you.

546
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,960
And it's really

547
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
different for us.

548
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,880
My mom really loves me.

549
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,000
So does my mom.

550
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
But she loves you in a wrong way,

551
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
so you need to fight.

552
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
How, how did you fight?

553
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,880
As your mom prevented you from being an actress,

554
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,560
you stopped audition

555
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,020
without fighting, right?

556
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,100
That's about the same.

557
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,400
It's a kind of acting as I do cosplay for others

558
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,730
through my online shop.

559
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,640
Then I'll quit.

560
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,600
You fight.

561
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
How can you, a journalist,

562
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
be so weak and depressed?

563
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,800
How about you?

564
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
Why are you looking at me?

565
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,760
Open the door. Open the door.

566
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,840
Ling Xiao.

567
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,090
Come and have your fingerprint recorded.

568
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,880
No need.

569
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,930
It's necessary.

570
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,840
No need.

571
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,280
I don't think I'll go to your house

572
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,640
when you're not at home.

573
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
When there is no paper in the toilet,

574
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll need your help.

575
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,970
Which finger do you want to use?

576
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,800
OK?

577
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,920
Have a try.

578
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,360
OK, right?

579
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,960
Yeah.

580
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,400
I'll go back.

581
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,360
Jianjian,

582
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,280
you're going to the hospital for a review tomorrow.

583
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,240
Would you like to go with me in the morning?

584
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,880
No need.

585
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,640
I'll draw pictures

586
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
late tonight

587
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,720
and get up late tomorrow.

588
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
I'll go by myself tomorrow.

589
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,290
See you. Good night.

590
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,340
You're still awake. Are you practicing?

591
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,260
I'll sleep now.

592
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,360
♫Light is hidden in the night by the sunset♫

593
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,640
♫but the sleepless stars dismantle the darkness♫

594
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,360
♫The night sky won't be dark♫

595
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,440
♫as long as the moonlight shines through the chinks♫

596
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
♫If you ask the night sky♫

597
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,320
♫about the twists and turns before dawn♫

598
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,840
♫It's just the past which will be gone tomorrow♫

599
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,160
♫So silence requires not too much talk♫

600
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,240
♫It just bears with everything♫

601
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,480
♫Looking back in despair every time♫

602
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,320
♫Having disheartened thoughts every time♫

603
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,240
♫How similar the night sky is to me!♫

604
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
♫It has the unyielding colors♫

605
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,640
Mingyue, did you make this?

606
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,640
Morning.

607
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
Tang Can and Qi Mingyue

608
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,960
went to work

609
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
after breakfast.

610
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,120
This is the breakfast

611
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
I specially made for you.

612
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,860
Don't stand still.

613
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,840
Go and wash.

614
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
By the way, you're still recovering,

615
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,460
so remember

616
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
to switch your brush to gentle mode.

617
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,640
Go.

618
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,340
Does it taste good?

619
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,200
That's great.

620
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,200
Then

621
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,280
I'll make breakfast

622
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
for you every day.

623
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,080
No need.

624
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,400
That's too much trouble.

625
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,000
We can buy

626
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,130
breakfast outside.

627
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,360
No.

628
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,680
I just learned to

629
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
make this for you, right?

630
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,320
By the way,

631
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,960
I've also

632
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,680
learnt to make food for

633
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,640
health preservation recently.

634
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,440
I'll make it

635
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
for dad and Mr. Ling when I master it.

636
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,480
We can't depend on Ling Xiao

637
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,010
when it comes to health preservation, right?

638
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Well. Have an apple.

639
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,760
Stop.

640
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,300
It comes undone. Here's a thread.

641
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,240
Well, go ahead.

642
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,480
By the way,

643
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,960
Ling Xiao asked me to tell you that

644
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,880
he made an appointment

645
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,010
for you at 10:30 a.m.

646
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:44,960
Go to Usmile Hospital for a review

647
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,640
after having breakfast.

648
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,540
Don't wear a long face.

649
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
You have a toothache. Have some fruit

650
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,770
for vitamin C. It's good for teeth.

651
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,970
Well, have a blueberry.

652
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,880
The nerves of that tooth isn't damaged.

653
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
You just need to have it filled.

654
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
I'll apply medicine on this one.

655
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,920
Come to extract dental nerves a few days later.

656
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
I won't eat candies after brushing my teeth any more.

657
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
I'll keep an eye on you later.

658
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,920
Well, where is the nurse?

659
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
There should be a nurse

660
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,810
working as your assistant beside, right?

661
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Are you so embarrassed

662
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
to be with me?

663
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,520
No.

664
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,200
I've known what you look like

665
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
when you tell a lie since childhood.

666
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,650
Open your mouth.

667
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,160
Hello, I'm Feng Xixi,

668
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
your brother's colleague.

669
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
This ice cream is for you.

670
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,720
Your brother went to get the medicine.

671
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,780
He'll be here soon.

672
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,840
Enjoy it. It reduces puffiness.

673
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,370
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

674
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,400
I'll eat it later.

675
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Call me Xixi.

676
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,920
According to your medical record, you're 25.

677
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,380
I'm 4 years older than you.

678
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,520
Thanks, Xixi.

679
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,610
You're welcome.

680
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,040
I learned that you have two brothers.

681
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,600
His surname is Ling and yours is Li.

682
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,480
Were you born of

683
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,240
the same mother but a different father?

684
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,370
Different parents.

685
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,760
Is one of you

686
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,360
adopted?

687
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,880
Neither.

688
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,680
Only Ziqiu is adopted.

689
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
So you and your brothers

690
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
are not related by blood?

691
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,440
Running a noodles restaurant, my dad

692
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,600
has time to

693
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
take care of kids.

694
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,880
Ling Xiao's dad

695
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,240
is so busy as a policeman.

696
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
It's something like

697
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
single-parent families

698
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
living together.

699
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,640
Doesn't your mom care about you?

700
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,280
She died of illness

701
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,680
when I was a kid.

702
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
I, I'm sorry.

703
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,260
Never mind. I don't remember.

704
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,410
Your family is so complicated.

705
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,240
How should I explain it

706
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,480
to my parents?

707
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
Is there any girl your brother likes?

708
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,720
Yes.

709
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,840
I like someone, Xixi.

710
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,720
There should be nothing wrong

711
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,760
with my teeth.

712
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,380
I'll go back to the studio.

713
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,320
Wait.

714
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,160
Remember to gargle after eating.

715
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,020
Don't eat spicy

716
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,200
or sweet spicy food.

717
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,120
I got it.

718
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,720
See you.

719
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,920
Thank you for your ice cream, Xixi.

720
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,000
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

721
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,500
You're so nice to your sister.

722
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,760
She is

723
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
much nicer to me.

724
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Come on.

725
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
You're completely

726
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
a great brother.

727
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,860
You don't understand.

728
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,320
Hello.

729
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,160
You suppose to

730
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,680
sleep at this moment,

731
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,040
night owl.

732
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,800
Meet now?

733
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,300
Where do you want to go?

734
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,120
I don't think

735
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,320
it's a proper place

736
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,580
for our first meeting.

737
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,600
How about having

738
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,240
desserts first, OK?

739
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,040
OK.

740
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,500
I'll send you the address.

741
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,440
Bye-bye.

742
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,480
According to the matchmaker,

743
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
you are just 1.6 meters high.

744
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,960
In fact, a short girl

745
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,160
isn't my preference.

746
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,140
But you look 1.65 meters high.

747
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,120
Don't be fooled by your eyes.

748
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm just 1.6 meters high.

749
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,600
How much do you earn

750
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,730
as a CPA every month?

751
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,560
I don't think it's appropriate

752
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,080
to talk about that at our first meeting.

753
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,360
Personally, I think that

754
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,120
we should

755
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,680
get to know about each other

756
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,940
in a blind date, right?

757
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
That makes sense.

758
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,760
I have a question.

759
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,640
It's heard that

760
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,560
you dated your ex-boyfriend for five years.

761
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,720
Why did you break up?

762
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,480
We're not the right one to each other.

763
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,560
Did you live together?

764
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,560
I got it by myself

765
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,090
instead of the matchmaker.

766
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,880
I think girls should

767
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,360
cherish their good name.

768
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,720
What?

769
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,800
I don't cherish my good name

770
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,860
because I stayed with the one I liked?

771
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,280
It may be

772
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,400
a stain

773
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,660
on girls' reputation.

774
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,920
Mr. Li,

775
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,680
I think

776
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,240
that's enough for us.

777
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
But it is

778
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,960
forgivable for me.

779
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,760
To err is human.

780
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,080
We were so blind that we loved scumbags.

781
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,560
Don't be angry.

782
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm just telling the truth.

783
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,380
Actually, I don't mind at all.

784
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,120
I'm an ordinary person.

785
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,760
Let's make do with it.

786
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,000
That's about it.

787
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
It is a violation of Article 246

788
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,560
of the Criminal Law

789
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,280
of the People's Republic of China

790
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,640
to publicly disparage others' personality

791
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,880
and damage their reputation.

792
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,810
You committed the crime of insult.

793
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,000
What?

794
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,560
I...

795
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,120
In particular, it is of a serious nature

796
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,960
as you talked wildly

797
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
in public.

798
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,880
This lady can sue you.

799
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,520
Come on. I'm telling the truth.

800
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,560
No. Who are you?

801
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,220
What are you doing?

802
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,040
Zhuang Bei from Haiming Law Firm.

803
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,360
Any question?

804
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,720
You're out of your minds.

805
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,200
In fact, his behavior did not constitute an insult.

806
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,040
It is a minor case.

807
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,120
I just scared him.

808
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,920
Are you a lawyer?

809
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,360
An assistant lawyer.

810
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,200
Did we meet

811
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,160
somewhere?

812
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,300
You, you're the airline stewardess.

813
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,760
You, you look quite different

814
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
from who you are at work.

815
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,320
I'm not an airline stewardess.

816
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,400
I run a Taobao shop

817
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,670
and receive cosplay orders

818
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,920
from my clients.

819
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,030
Frankly speaking, I do legwork.

820
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,290
I haven't heard of that before.

821
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,840
This is your pen.

822
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,659
It's important to you, right?

823
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,880
Thanks.

824
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,150
But I have a lot of them.

825
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
Do lawyers like

826
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,710
taking pens with you?

827
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,440
Like students,

828
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,500
assistant lawyers

829
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,000
also take down notes.

830
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,670
Then give it to me.

831
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,630
I can use it

832
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,889
when acting as a lawyer

833
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,400
to look more professional,

834
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,120
OK?

835
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,840
If you don't mind it is second-hand.

836
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,600
Here you are.

837
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,150
I won't.

838
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,520
Thanks.

839
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,640
What's wrong?

840
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,180
Well, sit down.

841
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,880
Can you do me a favor?

842
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Why don't you eat?

843
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
We're going to shoot very late today.

844
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,280
No. I'm on diet.

845
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,600
Come on.

846
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,360
You're thin enough.

847
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,640
A plump lady looks more attractive.

848
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,360
It is human's bad nature

849
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,040
to smash good things.

850
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

851
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
Please try again later.

852
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,960
Li Jianjian went to

853
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,560
meet Zheng Shuran.

854
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,840
She doesn't answer the phone

855
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,720
or reply on WeChat.

856
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I can't connect with her.

857
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,450
Don't worry. I'm going back now

858
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,120
Tang Can,

859
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,160
Li Jianjian is

860
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,280
dating a man.

861
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,000
She is

862
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
out of contact.

863
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,220
Do you know each other?

864
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,880
Ran's phone number?

865
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,280
I don't know.

866
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,400
I don't know him.

867
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,960
Mingyue,

868
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,600
I don't think

869
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,320
there's something to worry about.

870
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,580
They've known each other for a long time.

871
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
Yeah. I admit that

872
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,640
he always posts

873
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,240
something strange on Weibo.

874
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,160
But that's what artists are like, right?

875
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,760
He is comparatively normal.

876
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,800
No, but...

877
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,440
Even though I agree that

878
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,120
the artist is

879
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,000
too abnormally fanatical

880
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,560
to be a boyfriend,

881
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,480
they just went out

882
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,760
to meet each other.

883
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,720
No need to be so nervous, OK?

884
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
So do you know exactly

885
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,320
where this is?

886
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,160
Yes.

887
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,320
Isn't it the Italian ice cream shop

888
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,880
on Jiefang Road?

889
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,320
Oh.

890
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
You're really making a fuss.

891
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,840
I always think that

892
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,560
both brothers of Li Jianjian

893
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,100
are out of their minds.

894
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,800
This girl.

895
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,120
She was here an hour and a half ago?

896
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,720
Do you remember?

897
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,640
She left.

898
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Where did she go?

899
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,560
I don't know.

900
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,900
When did she left here?

901
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,040
It's about

902
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,160
one hour ago.

903
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm not sure.

904
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,140
What would you like to eat?

905
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,040
No, thanks.

906
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Did you get through?

907
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,820
She didn't answer.

908
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,480
Where can we find her in such a big city?

909
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,010
I'll take a look over there.

910
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,200
How long?

911
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,080
One hour, right?

912
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,320
Yes. One hour.

913
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,840
Mr. Ling, check the surveillance video.

914
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,120
The man is suspicious.

915
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,160
He got around us

916
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,320
to meet Jianjian alone.

917
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,650
He must harbor an evil intent towards her.

918
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,360
Calm down. Calm down.

919
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,560
I'll call her.

920
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,640
I've called her so many times.

921
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,400
At first the line was busy.

922
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,960
Then she didn't answer.

923
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,240
Now it is power off.

924
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,880
Perhaps her cell phone is out of power.

925
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
Dad, we're here to report the case.

926
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,280
Please follow the procedure.

927
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,480
Yeah, the procedure.

928
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,360
I followed the procedure.

929
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,320
Well.

930
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,040
They have known each other

931
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,800
online for several years,

932
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,720
right?

933
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,800
She was last seen

934
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,520
in a dessert shop

935
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,800
with a lot of people.

936
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,480
She is

937
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,160
out of contact for more than an hour,

938
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,480
right?

939
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,680
This is an ordinary

940
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,770
temporary disconnection.

941
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,800
Dad, what if he

942
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,560
tricks her into

943
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,490
going to a hotel?

944
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,280
Yeah.

945
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,600
Did you

946
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,960
call Mr. Li?

947
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,210
We're afraid he'll be worried.

948
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,040
Silly boys,

949
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,600
it's quite possible that

950
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,680
he knows Jianjian's

951
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,120
dating a man.

952
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,000
Whatever happens, be composed.

953
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,080
You're in a panic.

954
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,920
Fine, I'll

955
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,680
call him.

956
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
Hello, Heping.

957
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,520
Jianjian was tricked

958
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,400
into going to a hotel?

959
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
Who said that?

960
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,440
OK. I see.

961
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,690
Mr. Li said they were

962
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,240
in his noodles restaurant.

963
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,460
Here come the noodles.

964
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,880
Well. Come on.

965
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,320
Thanks, Mr. Li.

966
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
You're welcome.

967
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,080
Jianjian often says that

968
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,320
you make delicious noodles.

969
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,200
I wanted to taste them here long ago.

970
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,400
You should have come.

971
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,280
It's our first meeting today,

972
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,720
but you just want to eat my dad's noodles.

973
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,680
It has no difference

974
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,560
from meeting parents.

975
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,520
Right.

976
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,200
Would you like to go to my home tomorrow?

977
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,600
My parents are very nice.

978
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,520
Young man,

979
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
what's your name?

980
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,280
My name is Zheng Shuran.

981
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,360
"Shu" out of "shu fu (comfortable)" and "ran" out of "zi ran (nature)."

982
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,680
"Ran" out of "zi ran (cumin)."

983
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,640
A great name.

984
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,600
Well, enjoy them.

985
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,760
Or the noodles will stick together.

986
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,820
"Zi ran (nature)."

987
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,500
"Zi ran (nature)?"

988
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,760
I thought it was "zi ran (cumin)."

989
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,880
What's wrong?

990
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,200
Come here.

991
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,520
What?

992
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,360
Why don't you

993
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,920
tell your brothers that

994
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,720
you broke your cell phone?

995
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,360
How should I tell them

996
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,480
with a broken cell phone?

997
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,080
You should find a way.

998
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,800
You know what? They were so worried that

999
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,360
they reported to the police.

1000
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,320
What?

1001
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,330
They are out of their minds.

1002
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,440
They care about you.

1003
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
Thanks.

1004
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,280
Be more patient

1005
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,760
with them.

1006
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,040
OK. I see.

1007
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,840
OK?

1008
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,560
Enjoy them.

1009
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,780
Why did you bring him here?

1010
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,580
I brought him to have noodles.

1011
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,400
You're back.

1012
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,000
Just in time.

1013
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
I'll introduce.

1014
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,160
This is Shuran.

1015
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,680
Zheng. Zheng.

1016
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,160
Jianjian's friend.

1017
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,520
You've known each other for years, right?

1018
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,280
Yes.

1019
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,040
Mr. Li, I'm hungry.

1020
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,040
Please make me a bowl of seafood noodles.

1021
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,640
There is no seafood topping.

1022
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,080
I make you beef noodles

1023
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,440
with some fish balls, OK?

1024
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,280
Dad, I want to.

1025
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
OK. Two bowls.

1026
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,360
Then you

1027
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,480
have fun. Have fun.
