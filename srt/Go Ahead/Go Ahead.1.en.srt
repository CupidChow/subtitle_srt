00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,979
Go ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,860
Episode 1

4
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,460
What happened, Jianjian?

5
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,360
Are you OK?

6
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Come and let me see.

7
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,079
Are you OK?

8
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
It's fine. It's fine.

9
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,560
She's fine.

10
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,120
It was all my fault.

12
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
To make the moving easier,

13
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,160
I put everything

14
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,080
on this truck.

15
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,740
That's all right. She's fine.

16
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,720
Is this your noodle restaurant?

18
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,240
Yes.

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm the owner,

20
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Li Haichao.

21
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,650
Ling Heping.

22
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm moving

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,090
into this residential quarter today.

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,880
Oh.

25
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Third floor, second unit, third building.

26
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,730
How did you know?

27
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,360
Well,

28
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
Mrs. Fang of the neighborhood committee

29
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,120
told me that a police man

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,079
would move into the apartment above mine.

31
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,680
So is it you?

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,600
Yes, it's me.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,280
I just

34
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,040
got transferred to

35
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,600
the street police station here.

36
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,160
Please

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,440
be supportive of my work hereafter.

38
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Sure.

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,200
We'll help each other.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,480
Yes.

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,200
Ling.

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes?

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
It's so hot today.

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
Let's move our things first.

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,880
That is my wife Chen Ting.

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,440
Nice to meet you.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,640
And my son, Ling Xiao.

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,600
What a cute young lad!

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,530
say hello to this new friend

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Say hello.

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,000
What a good boy!

52
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,720
You've got so many things. How about this?

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,380
I'll go and help you in a while.

54
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,360
No,

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,960
I don't want to trouble you.

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
Don't be so polite.

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
We're neighbors.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,460
Go now, please.

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,160
OK. Thank you.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,800
I do find it hard

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560
to do it all by myself.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
Go now and park it at the door of the building.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,040
OK. OK.

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,079
Jianjian,

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
we're going to have a new neighbor.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
Are you happy?

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,390
Yes.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Well,

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,320
you haven't finished your noodles

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
which have stuck together.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
You shouldn't have come out to play.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,400
I haven't finished my picture yet.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,440
It's time to draw you now.

74
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Me?

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,920
It's good.

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,970
It's a good picture.

77
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Shouldn't you be rewarded for such a good picture?

78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes.

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,960
OK.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,760
I'll reward you with an ice cream.

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,520
I want two.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,120
You want two?

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,880
OK.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,400
But

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,930
you have to finish your noodles first.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,160
You know,

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,800
this apartment

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
is much better lighted

89
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,200
than our old one.

90
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
And the neighbors are warm-hearted.

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,480
Mrs. Fang gave us

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
such a big bowl of ribs.

93
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,240
Just now,

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
when I saw her out,

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
she told me

96
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,680
that Li Haichao who lived downstairs

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,080
had his wife pass away last year

98
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,840
and we shouldn't mention his wife in front of him.

99
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,320
Oh, my!

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,050
How did that happen?

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
When she was

102
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,040
six months pregnant,

103
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,920
they found that she had pulmonary hypertension.

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,120
The doctor recommended induced abortion,

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,780
but she didn't want to do that.

106
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
She refused it,

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
no matter how hard her family tried.

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,880
In the end,

109
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,720
before she could give birth,

110
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,040
she died with the baby in her belly.

111
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,640
It happened in the last June.

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
The little girl

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,320
I just met downstairs

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
lost her mom at such young age.

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
What a poor girl!

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,640
She is poor,

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
but I don't think

118
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,560
we're in any better position than they are.

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Come.

120
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Isn't it hot?

121
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
Come. It's ready now.

122
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,720
I'll plug it in and turn it on

123
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,120
to cool my dear wife.

124
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
Come.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Dear,

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,180
since we've moved,

127
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,450
please rest more

128
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,280
and don't think too much about it .

129
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm going to report for duty

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,220
and I'll come back for dinner.

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,100
Buy a ginger duck on your way home.

132
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,340
Ling Xiao loves it.

133
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Ling Xiao.

134
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,400
Put away your comic books.

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,930
What are you hiding?

136
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,159
Nothing.

137
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,400
Just my comics.

138
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,200
Step aside and let me see.

139
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,280
Step aside!

140
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,520
Mom,

141
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,240
sorry.

142
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,560
Madam.

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,440
You're the little girl

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
from that noodle restaurant, right?

145
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
Is your son home?

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
What do you want with him?

147
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
I've bought an ice cream for him.

148
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
He doesn't eat ice cream.

149
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,080
Thank you.

150
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,640
Jianjian,

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,170
dinner is ready.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,880
Jianjian,

153
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,170
we have sweet and sour pork ribs today.

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,520
Jianjian,

155
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,480
dinner is ready.

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,000
Dad.

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,440
What's up?

158
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,040
He has a little sister.

159
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
Where did you get this?

160
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
The madam upstairs threw it away.

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,080
It's a box full of toys.

162
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,320
Oh, my!

163
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,730
You can't have this.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,520
I have to throw it away.

165
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll buy you some new toys.

166
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,520
I want it!

167
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,760
I collected all these toys.

168
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,370
Jianjian, listen to me.

169
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,820
We can't take the things that others throw away.

170
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,440
Besides,

171
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,320
don't mention

172
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,080
this little girl

173
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,480
in front of the mister and the madam upstairs,

174
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,080
OK?

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,080
Why?

176
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,560
Because they've lost

177
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
this little girl.

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,560
Did she die

179
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,890
just like my mom?

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,120
No.

181
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
She has

182
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,720
become a fairy at sea.

183
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
Will my mom come back?

184
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,320
No.

185
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,280
She'll be a fairy

186
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,410
over there forever.

187
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,210
But that's okay.

188
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Many, many,

189
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,720
many years later,

190
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,320
we'll go over there too

191
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,170
and then we can be reunited.

192
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
When will that happen?

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
When

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,280
you become

195
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,400
a hunchbacked old lady.

196
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Oh, like this?

197
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,880
Sweet tender tofu!

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,840
Have a taste of the sweet tender tofu!

199
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
Young man,

200
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,930
would you like some sweet tender tofu?

201
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Yes, please.

202
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,560
So yummy, so yummy!

203
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,000
OK, that's it.

204
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm going to throw it out.

205
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,520
Dad,

206
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,140
it took me quite a while to stick it together.

207
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,600
OK.

208
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
You can keep it for now.

209
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,680
Go.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
Wash your hands and let's eat.

211
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,960
OK!

212
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,720
Haichao!

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,640
Haichao!

214
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,500
Yes, Mrs. Qian?

215
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,080
Oh, my!

216
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
Why are you still in your apron?

217
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
You haven't changed your clothes yet.

218
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,680
Hurry up and get changed.

219
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
There's no need for that.

220
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,100
I got changed this morning

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,000
and it's clean.

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh, it's your first time

223
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
to meet her.

224
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,560
You should at least make a good impression.

225
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
The book itself matters, not its cover.

226
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,680
So be it.

227
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,120
OK, so be it.

228
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,600
Take the apron off.

229
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,050
Let's go now.

230
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
If she arrives first and waits for us,

231
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,120
it would be rude.

232
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,600
Yes, you're right.

233
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,160
Mrs. Qian,

234
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,440
where are we going?

235
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,640
Jianjian,

236
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
would you like to

237
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,880
go to the park?

238
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,960
I want to go fishing

239
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,880
and I want a water gun!

240
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,560
OK.

241
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,620
I'll buy it for you.

242
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Great!

243
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,400
Let's go.

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,280
My noodle dough is ready.

245
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Just go.

246
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,480
He Mei,

247
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
this is Li Haichao

248
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
that I've been telling you about.

249
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
One of you

250
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
runs a noodle restaurant

251
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
and the other sells cosmetics at a mall counter.

252
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
Both of you

253
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
work indoors.

254
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
How great that is!

255
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,980
Get to know each other.

256
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,320
Hello.

257
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm He Mei.

258
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,940
Hello, I'm Li Haichao.

259
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
This is Ziqiu.

260
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Ziqiu, say hello.

261
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,760
Hello.

262
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,520
Hello.

263
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
Come. Let's shake hands.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,860
You're so cute.

265
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,120
How old are you?

266
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,980
I'm 7 years old.

267
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,560
I see.

268
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,940
Let me introduce a little younger sister to you.

269
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,560
Jianjian.

270
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,240
Humph!

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,920
Jianjian!

272
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,520
Jianjian!

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,720
Leave it to me.

274
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,840
I'll take care of her.

275
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,280
You two have a talk

276
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,280
and get to know each other.

277
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,640
OK.

278
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,160
OK.

279
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Jianjian!

280
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Would you like to go out to play too?

281
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,160
Yes.

282
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Well,

283
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,040
go and play with Jianjian,

284
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,560
OK?

285
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,280
Go.

286
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,800
OK.

287
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Let's sit down.

288
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,800
OK.

289
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,680
She's young and childish.

291
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,740
It doesn't matter.

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,740
Have some tea, please.

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,640
Thank you.

294
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,640
Mrs. Qian said

295
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,740
that your wife died of an illness.

296
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,040
Yes.

297
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
It happened not long ago, didn't it?

298
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,760
My neighbors are just being kind

299
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,600
to help me.

300
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,040
I understand.

301
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,440
The older generation thinks

302
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,840
that it's better to

303
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,200
live together with someone,

304
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
which is also good for the children.

305
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,880
Yes.

306
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,770
Do you have any hobbies?

307
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,280
Hobbies?

308
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,440
I...

309
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,480
I...

310
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,680
I love cooking.

311
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,120
Cooking?

312
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes, cooking.

313
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
What else?

314
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,600
Well other than that

315
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,040
I don't have any other hobbies.

316
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,300
I've been quite busy with my restaurant.

317
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,500
What about you?

318
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
I love reading books,

319
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,280
Like

320
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,800
"Anne Karenina"

321
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,890
and "Pride and Prejudice".

322
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,880
I'm busy

323
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,280
and I don't have much time to read, either.

324
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,760
Oh.

325
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
Yes.

326
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,880
Oh,

327
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,490
since you're

328
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,200
so busy with your work,

329
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
where does your son eat?

330
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
He buys something to eat.

331
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
He eats outside?

332
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,900
That can't be nutritious enough, can it?

333
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,480
I feel bad about it,

334
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,760
but I don't have a choice.

335
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
I have to

336
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,920
work ten hours a day.

337
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,680
That's really exhausting.

338
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,210
You don't have time to cook.

339
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,180
How about this?

340
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
Take your son to my noodle restaurant

341
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,970
to have noodles.

342
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,880
You like kids?

343
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
Yes.

344
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,400
Of course!

345
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
Kids are fun.

346
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,880
They stay around you

347
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,340
and they're adorable.

348
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,440
Here. Take it.

349
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Three yuan, is it?

350
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Yes.

351
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
So expensive.

352
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,400
Can't it be cheaper?

353
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,530
No, it really can't.

354
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,700
Never mind.

355
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,320
Jianjian!

356
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,520
Why did you spurt water at your big brother?

357
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,920
He's not my elder brother!

358
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,380
I don't want a stepmother!

359
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,600
Don't you like Ms. He Mei?

360
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,480
She's so pretty.

361
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,840
Don't you want one more person to take care of you?

362
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,080
I don't want a stepmother!

363
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,960
You're a bad person! A bad person!

364
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,760
What makes me a bad person?

365
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
You're being unreasonable.

366
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
You bad person, I will take you down!

367
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Jianjian!

368
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,400
You bad person

369
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,570
I will take you down!

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
You bad person!

371
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,160
Stop it! Don't spurt water at him!

372
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,020
You bad person!

373
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,900
You bad person!

374
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,290
Stop it! Stop it!

375
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Look at you!

376
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,440
You got Ziqiu's clothes

377
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,240
all wet.

378
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,280
What if he catches

379
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,000
a cold?

380
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,069
We'll have to take him

381
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,760
to the hospital

382
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,890
and it'll cost a lot.

383
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,040
As a result,

384
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,640
we won't have the money to...

385
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,109
Ling Xiao,

386
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,490
let's play water gun together.

387
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,720
She's talking to you!

388
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,400
Say hello.

389
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,600
Ling Xiao,

390
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,480
hello.

391
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,280
Are you going out?

392
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm going to do some shopping.

393
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Did you take her

394
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,980
to play somewhere?

395
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,570
My father went on a blind date with a vixen!

396
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,680
She must be pretty.

397
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,440
It was just a date.

398
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Good for you.

399
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
Actually, pretty women

400
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,680
are hard to live with.

401
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,930
Then we're leaving now.

402
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,800
Ling Xiao!

403
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,600
Stop it, please.

404
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,840
Let's go home.

405
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,040
Let's go play at home.

406
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't spurt water

407
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,240
on Ling Xiao too!

408
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
You naughty girl!

409
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,680
You know,

410
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,800
his wife just died

411
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,880
more than a year ago

412
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,060
and he has gone on a blind date.

413
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,960
His wife died

414
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
of giving birth to their child.

415
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,600
How could he be

416
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,840
so heartless?

417
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,280
You didn't see

418
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
how smug he was

419
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
when his daughter mentioned that vixen.

420
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Unbelievable!

421
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,320
But I think

422
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,800
he's a good person.

423
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,380
Why are you eating so fast?

424
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,170
I'm on night duty today.

425
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,170
Have you been home for half an hour?

426
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,680
I've just got transferred here.

427
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,560
I have to get familiar with everything here

428
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,240
and I have a lot of work to do.

429
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,240
It's the same

430
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
wherever we live.

431
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,000
You don't want

432
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,240
to see me, right?

433
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,960
No.

434
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,840
How about

435
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,040
you get another wife?

436
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
Li Haichao

437
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
is having blind dates.

438
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,960
His dates are pretty,

439
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,820
so would you like to meet them too?

440
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,360
I dare not, honey.

441
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,240
You say, I work so hard

442
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,320
just for you

443
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,600
and our family.

444
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,440
For our family?

445
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,640
I can't see that!

446
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,650
Do you know what this is?

447
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,970
It's a welcome gift.

448
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Bingo!

449
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,050
Li Jianjian!

450
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,560
Here!

451
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,520
Set out!

452
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,120
Yes, sir!

453
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
Open the door for your father.

454
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
He must have forgotten his keys.

455
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,560
Ling Xiao,

456
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,000
this is our welcome gift for you.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
My father and I picked them in the mountain.

458
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,360
Go away!

459
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
What's wrong?

460
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,600
This...

461
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,940
Well...

462
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,760
Jianjian,

463
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,280
what happened?

464
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
He doesn't like walnuts.

465
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,780
Let's send him something else next time.

466
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Next time?

467
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
How about sweets?

468
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,890
Sweets are nice.

469
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
So are fried sugar pancakes

470
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,640
and sweet tender tofu.

471
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,680
Come on.

472
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,200
Enough sweets.

473
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,400
Your little teeth

474
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,640
are being eaten up by tooth bugs.

475
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,700
It doesn't matter.

476
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,680
I'll have some new teeth.

477
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,360
Xiao,

478
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,570
let's go downstairs

479
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,680
and apologize to Jianjian

480
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,760
after dinner.

481
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,400
She was being kind

482
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,040
to send us some mountain products.

483
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
Don't you think you were rude

484
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,080
to do that to her?

485
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,200
No need for that.

486
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
No need to apologize.

487
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,960
Chen Ting,

488
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,920
we're neighbors

489
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
and we meet frequently.

490
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,880
Besides,

491
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
they don't know what happened in our family.

492
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,160
You say,

493
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,200
isn't it a little bit unreasonable

494
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,680
to behave like this?

495
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,890
You think I'm being unreasonable, don't you?

496
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,200
No.

497
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
I mean,

498
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,320
people might think

499
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,120
we're being unreasonable

500
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,560
to behave like this.

501
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
They're being kind.

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So they can hurt me

503
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,080
brazenly?

504
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,320
It seems you're just fine

505
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,520
and I'm the only one who suffers, right?

506
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,120
I'll shut up! I'll shut up!

507
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,960
Don't yell in front of Xiao.

508
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,160
You want to be a good father now!

509
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,360
What were you doing back then?

510
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,000
It couldn't have happened

511
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,120
if you had cared about us

512
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,160
just a little bit more!

513
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,640
OK. OK.

514
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,480
Forget it.

515
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
We had agreed

516
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,240
not to mention it again

517
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,280
and live a good life together.

518
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,210
Did I bring it up?

519
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,320
Don't I want to live a good life?

520
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,840
I brought it up. I'm sorry.

521
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,680
My fault.

522
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,560
I shouldn't have brought it up.

523
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,400
I promise you

524
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,460
that I won't bring it up again.

525
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,800
Let's eat now

526
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
and I have to go to work after dinner.

527
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,080
Son, let's eat.

528
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,480
Go to work?

529
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,880
Just focus on your work!

530
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,120
No need to come home!

531
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,720
No need to eat!

532
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
Are you out of your mind?

533
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,320
Yes, I'm out of my mind.

534
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,480
Can I not?

535
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,000
That was my baby girl!

536
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,160
Do you think I'm not sad?

537
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,090
But we have to...

538
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,600
Let's eat.

539
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,860
...continue our life!

540
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,200
Hurry up.

541
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,000
Coming.

542
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,880
Haichao said that you didn't like him.

543
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,400
I knew it.

544
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,240
You have an eye for men.

545
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
Haichao's condition

546
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
is not the best,

547
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,720
but he can

548
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
support a family.

549
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
The most important thing is that he's a good man

550
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,900
and lots of girls prefer men like him.

551
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,560
If you two get married,

552
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,680
you'll have both a son and a daughter.

553
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
How great is that!

554
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Let's see.

555
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I just passed by,

556
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,520
so I took my son to have some noodles here.

557
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,960
OK.

558
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,720
OK.

559
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,080
You two have a try

560
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
and we'll see.

561
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,690
This restaurant is not big,

562
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,320
but the business is great.

563
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
The clients are the neighbors here.

564
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
And it'll fly into

565
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
Jianjian's mouth.

566
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,560
Hello!

567
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,600
Come inside and have some watermelon in a while.

568
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,480
Come in.

569
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,480
Oh, my!

570
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,200
I've bought a watermelon.

571
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, you're back.

572
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
That's my frog.

573
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,960
Well,

574
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,080
here you are.

575
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,410
I don't want it anymore!

576
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,620
What are you doing, Jianjian?

577
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,840
How could you talk to Ziqiu like that?

578
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
How could you hit him?

579
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,930
You know,

580
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,160
he is our customer.

581
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Haven't I told you

582
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,770
what the customers are?

583
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,320
The customers are always right.

584
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,400
How could you hit him?

585
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,080
Besides, how many frogs

586
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,720
have you broken

587
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,680
this month?

588
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,000
I won't have money to buy you another one if you break this one.

589
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,160
Look how sweaty you are!

590
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,840
Don't be angry,

591
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,400
or you will sweat more.

592
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
Come, cool down

593
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,140
and don't be angry.

594
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,810
Have a piece of watermelon.

595
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,600
Come.

596
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,520
Come.

597
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,360
Have some watermelon.

598
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,640
Thank you.

599
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,600
Ziqiu, have a piece.

600
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,800
Thank you.

601
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,170
You're welcome.

602
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,140
She's younger than you

603
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
and you're older,

604
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
so will you forgive her?

605
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,320
I shouldn't have played with her toy.

606
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,440
Sorry.

607
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,360
Oh, my!

608
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,840
What a good boy!

609
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,400
You'll surely become a great young man.

610
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,530
I want to reward you,

611
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,520
so what would you like to eat for lunch?

612
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
I'll cook for you.

613
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,720
Nothing spicy.

614
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Nothing spicy.

615
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,200
Oh, I see. So that's it?

616
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,320
Don't touch him!

617
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,560
What's wrong?

618
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,200
I won't break him

619
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
by touching him, right?

620
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,480
Don't be angry.

621
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
I'll touch your face too.

622
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
Kids are kids.

623
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,520
So how about this?

624
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,760
I'll cook some cold noodles

625
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,440
for you.

626
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,680
Are there any types of food that you really don't like?

627
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,940
I don't like scallion.

628
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,880
OK, got it.

629
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,120
Got it.

630
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,540
OK, how about this?

631
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,400
Jianjian,

632
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,000
you play with Ziqiu

633
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
and don't fight anymore, OK?

634
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,600
I want to go out to play.

635
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,240
You...

636
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,520
But...

637
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,930
Fine, just go ahead.

638
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,210
Don't go too far.

639
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,840
This kid.

640
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,760
OK, I'm going to make the noodles.

641
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,480
Mrs. Qian, please take care of them.

642
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,120
If you want some more sunflower seeds,

643
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,920
they're in the counter.

644
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,360
Just help yourselves.

645
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,120
I know.

646
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,160
You just go ahead

647
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
and leave it to me.

648
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,970
Don't worry.

649
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,280
His eyes are like brass bells,

650
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,600
showing lightning cleverness.

651
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
His ears are like antennas...

652
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,320
Would you like some of it?

653
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,200
Brother, would you like to watch

654
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
"Black Cat Sheriff"?

655
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,680
I'm not your brother.

656
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,240
Go away!

657
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
Brother, would you like to watch

658
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,280
the kittens at Doudou's?

659
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
His pet Dahuang

660
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,740
gave birth to a litter of kittens.

661
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,960
Sheriff! Sheriff!

662
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
This is White Dove! This is White Dove!

663
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,440
We've found the monster's nest!

664
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,980
You say that again!

665
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
Sheriff! Sheriff!

666
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,120
This is White Dove! This is White Dove!

667
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,920
We've found the monster's nest!

668
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,040
Sheriff! Sheriff!

669
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,960
This is White Dove!

670
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,600
This is White Dove!

671
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,660
We're coming soon!

672
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,400
Why do they fight every day?

673
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,560
You say,

674
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,920
will they break

675
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,440
our ceiling one day?

676
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,500
Can't you stop thinking about it?

677
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,920
And they might fall into our home!

678
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,960
I can't!

679
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,680
I can't eat or sleep!

680
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,800
I can't control myself!

681
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,600
Brother,

682
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
would you like some watermelon?

683
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,560
It's very sweet.

684
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,010
Oh, there're so many customers today.

685
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
There're many customers every day.

686
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Heping, come.

687
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,120
Come and sit here.

688
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,720
Sit here. Sit.

689
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,920
Mrs. Fang, Mrs. Qian.

690
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,400
Are you having lunch?

691
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Nobody comes home

692
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,480
for lunch today,

693
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,140
so we came out to have noodles.

694
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Won't you go home for lunch, either?

695
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,160
I have some work to do in the station,

696
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,280
so I'll eat quickly

697
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,740
and go back to the station.

698
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,080
Heping, you're here.

699
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,240
Your noodles.

700
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,200
Thank you.

701
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,320
And yours.

702
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,530
Thank you, Haichao.

703
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,050
Shredded cucumber.

704
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,360
You give us free cold dishes every time.

705
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,240
Can you make money like this?

706
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,120
Yes.

707
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
What would you like to have?

708
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,640
The same, cold noodles with chicken shreds.

709
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,560
With extra noodles.

710
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,120
OK!

711
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,680
Please wait for a moment.

712
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
I say, Heping.

713
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,200
Yes?

714
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Married couples

715
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
do argue,

716
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,800
just like our teeth bite our tongues sometimes,

717
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,960
but it hurts

718
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,280
our feelings.

719
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
You're a good man,

720
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
so be nicer to Chen Ting.

721
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,440
Well, even you

722
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,080
know what happened

723
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,200
in our family.

724
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,080
This building is not soundproof.

725
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,840
If you break a bowl,

726
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
everyone in the building can hear it.

727
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,320
You still have a kid at home,

728
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,580
so pay attention to it.

729
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,080
OK.

730
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm sorry

731
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,400
to have troubled

732
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,640
you guys.

733
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,880
In fact,

734
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm trying to

735
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
avoid

736
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,560
the conflicts.

737
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
She's in a bad mood now

738
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,600
and she finds everyone annoying.

739
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,360
So I should

740
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,000
avoid showing up in front of her.

741
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,280
That's not a proper solution.

742
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,680
Be careful.

743
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,730
Maybe she's preparing a big move against you at home.

744
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,240
You have to communicate with her and admit your mistakes.

745
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,970
I'm not good at communication.

746
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,480
I don't know what else

747
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
to say to her.

748
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,440
I've apologized

749
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,300
and said everything that I could.

750
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,420
It might be fine in a while.

751
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,880
Don't avoid her,

752
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,440
or she might be really disappointed at you.

753
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,000
Communicate with her

754
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,280
and don't make it worse,

755
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,440
otherwise you might

756
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,760
get into a real trouble.

757
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,320
Yeah.

758
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,440
You men

759
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
are really careless.

760
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,680
Yes.

761
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,240
Your noodles!

762
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,450
With extra noodles.

763
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:49,840
OK.

764
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,160
Tell me if you want more.

765
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,400
It's your first time here,

766
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,200
so this meat dish is on the house.

767
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,400
I can't accept it!

768
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,480
I can't have it for free.

769
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,960
Haichao's sliced boiled pork with garlic sauce

770
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,840
is great.

771
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,240
Yes!

772
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,970
Have a taste.

773
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,280
OK, I'll have a taste.

774
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
What do you think?

775
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,260
It's great.

776
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,220
Please enjoy it together.

777
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,200
Jianjian,

778
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,440
don't just eat the meat.

779
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,970
Finish the vegetables too.

780
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,680
Heping,

781
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,280
you have only one child

782
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
and he must be lonely.

783
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,160
He doesn't have even a playmate.

784
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,000
But now

785
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,400
Jianjian lives downstairs,

786
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,120
so they can be each other's

787
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,920
playmates.

788
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,840
Jianjian could be Ling Xiao's little sister,

789
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,360
right?

790
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,320
Chen Ting, please calm down!

791
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
What made you become like this?

792
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,400
Have I changed?

793
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,880
But you haven't!

794
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,520
You are always so busy!

795
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,560
Do you even care about me?

796
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,160
Do you know how hard it is for me?

797
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,840
Ling Xiao,

798
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,680
why are you sitting here?

799
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,080
It must be uncomfortable sitting here.

800
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,760
How about

801
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,120
coming to my home?

802
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,400
Jianjian is watching cartoons right now

803
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,840
and I'll cook

804
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,500
some salt and pepper shrimps.

805
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,520
Thank you uncle.

806
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,800
But I've already had dinner.

807
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,400
I see.

808
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,880
But even so,

809
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,920
you can't be comfortable sitting here.

810
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
The mosquitoes here might bite you.

811
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,080
OK then.

812
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,360
Go on reading.

813
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,380
How about this?

814
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,000
If you want to come,

815
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,380
just knock at the door.

816
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,560
Unfortunately,

817
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,840
the power is off.

818
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,720
The people's living standards are better now,

819
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,360
so every family is air-conditioned,

820
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
but the transformer can't stand it.

821
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,920
If only there are two households

822
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,710
turn on the air conditioners,

823
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,190
bang,

824
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
the power will be off!

825
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,100
And there's nothing we can do.

826
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,440
Don't stand there. Please be seated.

827
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,880
Make yourself comfortable.

828
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,440
OK.

829
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Thank you.

830
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,760
Use the fan.

831
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,840
OK.

832
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,920
It's awesome of you to live your life like this

833
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,600
when you're raising your kid

834
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,159
all by yourself.

835
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,670
I'm flattered.

836
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,320
I just want to run

837
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
the noodle restaurant

838
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,810
and take good care of my kid.

839
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,520
Speaking of running a noodle restaurant,

840
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
it's not that hard

841
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
but not that easy either.

842
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,520
The most important thing is to make good toppings

843
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,980
and knead dough properly.

844
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,120
Generally,

845
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,800
I go to work at 3 or 4 o'clock

846
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,210
to make the toppings

847
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,660
and to knead dough.

848
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
When it's open,

849
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,640
the chef

850
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
just need to boil the noodles,

851
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,800
so it doesn't matter if I'm there or not.

852
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,760
After it closes,

853
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,720
I will

854
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
tidy up everything

855
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,380
and that's all.

856
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,120
The neighbors here

857
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,720
know my condition

858
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,720
and they come to my restaurant a lot.

859
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,240
You know,

860
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,680
if you like noodles...

861
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm too wordy.

862
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,880
Please have some fruits and tea.

863
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,570
You're amazing.

864
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,440
But I'm not.

865
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,720
I can't even take good care of myself.

866
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,840
Don't you

867
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,080
have some family members here?

868
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,900
Do you take care of Ziqiu all by yourself?

869
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
My father passed away very long ago

870
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
and my mother lives in the countryside.

871
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,450
Only after divorcing my ex,

872
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,320
did I realize that I was pregnant.

873
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,180
I insisted on giving birth to him,

874
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,040
so it had nothing to do with his family.

875
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,120
You're really

876
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,560
so brave.

877
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,160
It has nothing to do with bravery.

878
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,840
If I had known that it would be so hard,

879
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,170
I wouldn't have done it.

880
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,880
He has suffered a lot

881
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,200
living with me,

882
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,000
and so have I.

883
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,480
You regret it?

884
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,560
It's not too late yet.

885
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,320
Let me take care of Ziqiu,

886
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,620
if you're willing.

887
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,080
I like kids.

888
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
But you won't.

889
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,080
They're doing it again. See?

890
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,600
This...

891
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,320
Well,

892
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,160
the couple upstairs

893
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,760
quarrel a lot.

894
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,000
And they smash things when they quarrel.

895
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,040
I'm used to it now.

896
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,400
So the little boy

897
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,280
sitting outside just now

898
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,200
is their son?

899
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,320
Yes, he is.

900
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,480
When the parents quarrel,

901
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,680
the children suffer.

902
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,900
What a poor kid!

903
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,560
Yes.

904
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,720
Great.

905
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,360
I'll move it closer to you.

906
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,680
Is this OK?

907
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,760
Be seated.

908
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
I heard that your parents fought a lot.

909
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,080
Do they hit you?

910
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Zhu Peng,

911
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,480
he doesn't talk.

912
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,640
He is dumb.

913
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,600
So you are dumb!

914
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,960
You dumb!

915
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,520
So can you talk?

916
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,600
You dumb!

917
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,960
You dumb!

918
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,640
Don't go!

919
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,040
Did I let you go?

920
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,720
You Pigsy!

921
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,400
Li Jianjian, you hit Zhu Peng!

922
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm going to tell his mother!

923
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
Look at what your daughter

924
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,680
has done to my son!

925
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
But Jianjian has lost

926
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,400
some hair

927
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,120
at this place.

928
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
And her face is swollen too, right?

929
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
Kids fight and it's inevitable.

930
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,760
And Ziqiu's eyes,

931
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,880
look how dangerous this is!

932
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,400
But she shouldn't have bitten others!

933
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,760
Besides, your daughter

934
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,680
started it!

935
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,440
He bullied Ling Xiao!

936
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,040
Peng,

937
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,840
you're in second grade, right?

938
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,920
Look how tall and strong

939
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,480
you are right now!

940
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,340
You're already a young man

941
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,760
and a young man should protect

942
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,680
the weak and the young

943
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,040
in this residential quarter, right?

944
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,480
Yes.

945
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
It doesn't matter. They're just kids.

946
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,700
It's normal for them to fight.

947
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,680
Wait, I'll get some tincture of iodine

948
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,800
for Peng to get disinfected.

949
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,680
No need.

950
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,130
We have some at home.

951
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,900
How dare you bully others?

952
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,120
I'm going to give you a hard lesson about it.

953
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,560
Let's go.

954
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
Don't. Don't.

955
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,960
Peng.

956
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,570
Listen to me.

957
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,560
Come to

958
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,280
my noodle restaurant for noodles

959
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,320
with your mother

960
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
when you have time

961
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,600
and it's on the house.

962
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,280
Thank you.

963
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,680
Since you've said it,

964
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,360
I'll accept it.

965
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
You're welcome.

966
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,400
We're neighbors.

967
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,880
Come.

968
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,120
Don't spank him.

969
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,240
Oh, fine.

970
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
That's it.

971
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,680
The two of you,

972
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,740
wash your hands and let's eat.

973
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,120
It's Ziqiu's first time

974
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,600
to fight with

975
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,260
other kids.

976
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,360
I'm sorry

977
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,980
that he was affected by Jianjian.

978
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
I think it's good.

979
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,890
That's what a boy should do.

980
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,800
You're right.

981
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,210
Sit down.

982
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,250
Sit next to your mom.

983
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,400
Here.

984
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,760
Thank you.

985
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,400
Here, Ziqiu.

986
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,560
Thank you.

987
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,120
You're welcome.

988
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,480
Take them.

989
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,840
Why the long face?

990
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,680
Should you have bitten others?

991
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,800
Are you a puppy?

992
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
You got into trouble

993
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,560
and that's fine,

994
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,840
but you even got Ziqiu into this.

995
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,360
Look at

996
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,560
his eyes.

997
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,960
How dangerous that is!

998
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
He did it on his own!

999
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,840
I did it on my own.

1000
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
You'll have only vegetables today.

1001
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,160
Now eat.

1002
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,200
Jianjian,

1003
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
tell me honestly.

1004
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,000
Have you bitten anyone else?
