00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,940
Episode 19

4
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,030
Here are your cakes.

5
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,079
Thanks.

6
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Please enjoy.

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,540
Why are you still here?

8
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,240
I paid for the coffee.

9
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,940
Just leave!

10
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Take care. They may sue you for sexual harassment.

11
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,880
No.

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
Girls.

13
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
There is a pervert over there,

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
drawing you secretly.

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,530
Shall I call the police?

16
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,000
Is your waist is so slender?

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Your legs are really long.

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,480
Are you that pretty?

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,210
We look so good in this drawing.

20
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,960
Sir, are you a painter?

21
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,520
No, I do human sculptures.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,920
Then you are the artist.

23
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm still unworthy of being called an artist.

24
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,720
Are you taking us

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
as your models?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Your girls have good physical conditions

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
with standard body proportions.

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,680
Really?

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
Why are you following me?

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,760
Brother Ziqiu!

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,890
Who's your brother?

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,079
I'm telling you,

33
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,040
as long as I'm here,

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,520
you are not going to be

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,780
a part of the Li family!

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,320
You are not acting like a brother,

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,560
but a jealously husband.

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Whatever you say.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,840
Anyway, I don't agree.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,480
What if Li Jianjian gets married in the future...

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,079
Sorry,

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,040
our Li Jianjian

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,960
doesn't have to get married.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,160
I can take care of her.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,520
All men are the pits!

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
Then you are the pits, too.

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
Having been fed by the Li family for so many years,

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
you just left with your rich father

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,690
as soon as he came to you.

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,520
Li Jianjian told you so?

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,680
Isn't that obvious?

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
You know nothing!

53
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,440
Ziqiu!

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,730
You are here.

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,160
You idiot!

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
Li Jianjian, come with me.

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,080
What's up?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,040
Li Jianjian, let's see

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
what kind of boyfriend you are dating with.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
He seduces women at all times.

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,370
Take a look. Take a closer look.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,480
He's even chatting with the girls!

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm telling you,

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,960
when you were not here,

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
he kept staring at their bottoms

66
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,760
and faces

67
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
and drawing them.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,620
How could you date with such a man?

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
What's wrong?

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,320
What's wrong?

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,159
Just break up with him!

72
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,720
You airhead!

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
And you ask me what's wrong!

74
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,050
Don't touch my head.

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
OK, I won't touch your head.

76
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm telling you, do you understand

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
you can never believe

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,720
a man's promise?

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,040
Why are you staring at me?

80
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,120
Why are you talking

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,440
like Mrs. Qian?

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Like Mrs. Qian? You little airhead!

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Just break up with him!

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,840
Hurry up and break up with him!

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Don't touch my head!

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,300
I'll hit you! I'll hit you!

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,620
Don't touch me!

88
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,000
What do you do, Tang Can?

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,850
She runs an online shop.

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,760
These days,

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
young people are not willing to work for others.

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
They prefer to start their own business.

93
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Her online shop is doing very well

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,480
and she's very busy.

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,960
I told her not to come since she was busy.

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,020
But she still came.

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm not busy every day.

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,840
Playing mahjong with you

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,370
makes me relaxed and happy.

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
You honey-lipped girl!

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,010
I really don't understand.

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,920
My son Zhuang Bei

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
is just a legal assistant

104
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
who doesn't make much money,

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,080
but he's busy all day!

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,200
A future lawyer

107
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,720
will make lots of money one day.

108
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,480
Even a part of his income

109
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,360
will surpass

110
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
my son's salary.

111
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,920
He's an engineer.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Lawyers are no match for engineers.

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Character eight.

114
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,000
Character eight? I form a pong!

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
You are obviously

116
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,159
doing the pair!

117
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,960
Tang Can,

118
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,360
how could you give her the character eight?

119
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,680
I'm very happy today.

120
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,720
So glad that Zhuang Bei has a good friend like you.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,580
And you even play mahjong with me.

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
Zhuang Bei was my senior at school.

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,120
I think he's a very kind person.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,920
Right?

125
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
Everyone in our neighborhood

126
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
praises my son

127
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,480
Zhuang Bei.

128
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
He's my eldest son.

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,000
I just hope him

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
to live a happy life.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
I wish my mom

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
would think the same.

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,690
What's wrong with your mom?

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,440
She has never satisfied with me.

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,570
And we always quarrel with each other.

136
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
I may not be able

137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,120
to live up to her expectations.

138
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,400
What does she expect of you?

139
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,260
She wants you to get married soon?

140
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,000
Previously,

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
she wanted me to make more commercials.

142
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,080
And now,

143
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
she may hope me to make less trouble.

144
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,500
You don't understand.

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Let me tell you,

146
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,000
a mom always focuses

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,930
all her attention on her children.

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,640
She just hopes her children to live well.

149
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,840
What a mom fears most?

150
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,600
She fears most that her children may take a wrong path.

151
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,480
Therefore,

152
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,640
you should try to understand your mom.

153
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,880
I knew a mom

154
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,760
would think over problems

155
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,560
from another mom's point of view.

156
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,360
Of course.

157
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,400
We are all moms.

158
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,400
All right, Auntie!

159
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,320
You are beautiful,

160
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,050
so everything you say is right.

161
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
You are so honey-lipped.

162
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
Let's make an appointment next time.

163
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,120
No problem.

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,650
Just contact me in advance.

165
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,610
The taxi is here.

166
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
Auntie, I'm leaving now.

167
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,160
All right.

168
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,600
Goodbye!

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,040
You asked me to go out sketching.

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,080
So why are you eating food

171
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,340
by yourself beside me?

172
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
See? You also keep sighing.

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,050
When you grow up, you'll be faced with a lot of family issues.

174
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,340
What happened?

175
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,520
It's not a big deal.

176
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
My brother

177
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,560
will go back to Singapore the day after tomorrow.

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,320
I was wondering

179
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,280
whether I should

180
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,960
get some souvenirs for him to bring back?

181
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,760
Then you can

182
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,600
just ask him.

183
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,340
How can you ask about it directly?

184
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,120
If you ask,

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,560
it seems that you don't want to buy souvenirs.

186
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
And you know,

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
my brother's mother

188
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,000
is really a difficult person.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
As long as she's not satisfied with your gifts,

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,000
she'll probably

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,040
throw them out!

192
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,170
She did that before.

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,880
Are you worrying that

194
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,920
she may not let your brother go back here?

195
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
That's impossible.

196
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,400
My brother is an adult now.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's just he has a biological sister younger than him.

198
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
I don't know how difficult she is right now.

199
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,559
Biological sister? So what?

200
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,880
When boys grow up,

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,460
they always follow around nominal sisters.

202
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,809
My brother doesn't have a nominal sister.

203
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,160
Listen, we are on a date.

204
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Why are you

205
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,640
keep talking about Ling Xiao

206
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,480
and Ziqiu?

207
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
Can we only

208
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,680
pour out our grievances to each other,

209
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,600
draw pictures

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
and see art exhibitions together?

211
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Can't we talk about something else?

212
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,140
About what?

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
Let's do what a couple should do

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
on a date.

215
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Stop, stop, stop!

216
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
What's the matter? I can't kiss you?

217
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,240
It's so sudden.

218
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm not mentally prepared

219
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,480
at all!

220
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,560
Both love and kiss

221
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
happen naturally.

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,720
Our lips also have

223
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,850
their own thoughts.

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
But my brain doesn't allow

225
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,000
my body parts to mess around.

226
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,760
All right.

227
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,560
Then give the command

228
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
to your brain.

229
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
You do it. You kiss me.

230
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,320
They didn't even give you water

231
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,200
when you were with them?

232
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,640
I didn't want to drink too much water

233
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,280
and go to the bathroom again and again.

234
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
These women sat there for three hours

235
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,360
to play mahjong

236
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
without even moving their asses!

237
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,120
They didn't even pee!

238
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,740
How much money did you win?

239
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,980
I lost 300 yuan.

240
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Did Zhuang Bei's mother

241
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,450
give you back the money?

242
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,120
Why should she?

243
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,680
It's mahjong. What one gains, the other loses.

244
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,760
If I win next time,

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,130
I won't give the money back to her, either.

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,560
You are being silly for men again.

247
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
What do you mean by "again"?

248
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,360
You have a history.

249
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
Your ex-boyfriend

250
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,800
owes you 25,000 yuan

251
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,320
and he hasn't pay the debt now.

252
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Last year,

253
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
he wanted to borrow another 5,000 yuan from you

254
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,280
so that his current girlfriend could have an abortion.

255
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,600
If Li Jianjian

256
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
hadn't found it,

257
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
you could have rounded the debt

258
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,920
up to 30,000 yuan!

259
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,170
Why do you mention that scumbag again?

260
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm a different person now.

261
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
I almost forget it if you don't mention this.

262
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,680
Has he returned the money to you?

263
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Don't be angry if I tell you.

264
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,280
Tell me.

265
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,920
He blacklisted me.

266
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,420
I guess he won't return the money.

267
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Look at you!

268
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
You look so pretty and clever.

269
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
Anyone who doesn't know you

270
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
would think you are taking money

271
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
from men to spend!

272
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
You silly girl!

273
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,000
From now on,

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
don't tell me if you spend money on men,

275
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
because it makes me so angry!

276
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,640
Why are you putting snacks

277
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,080
into the gift box?

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
You know, Ling Xiao will go back to Singapore

279
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,640
the day after tomorrow.

280
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,080
My mom got these snacks,

281
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,240
but she has never eaten them.

282
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,400
In case they go out of date,

283
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,000
I want to give them to Ling Xiao,

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
so that he can bring them back as a souvenir.

285
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
But it's inconvenient to carry these small boxes.

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
I just spent some money on men,

287
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,720
but someone

288
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
are taking things from her parents

289
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
to help out her man!

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Don't talk nonsense!

291
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,840
It's just they may go out of date.

292
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
I don't want to waste them.

293
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,240
Don't you think so?

294
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,480
What are you doing?

295
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Qi Mingyue,

296
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
you even wear perfume!

297
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,560
I sprayed some perfume this morning.

298
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm back.

299
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
Jianjian, come here!

300
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,000
You see, Mingyue has packed a lot of snacks

301
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,260
for Ling Xiao to bring back to Singapore.

302
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,360
Does it look nice?

303
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,960
Let me bring it to my brother.

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,260
This silly girl really can't take a hint.

305
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,540
What are you carrying?

306
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,360
Qi Mingyue prepared this for you

307
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,800
to take to Singapore.

308
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,760
What's up?

309
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Isn't it for me?

310
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,400
Do you want me to help you pack up?

311
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,700
You don't know what I want to take.

312
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,120
You'll be away for only two days.

313
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,180
Do you have to use such a big suitcase?

314
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll just go with the bag.

315
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,040
I knew it!

316
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,120
The suitcase is too big.

317
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,920
It looks like you are moving out.

318
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
When I come back,

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,560
I'll bring you

320
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,880
the pineapple tarts and nougats

321
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
next to my school.

322
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,890
Pineapple tarts and others don't matter.

323
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,560
Have you booked your return flight?

324
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,440
If you book it before leaving

325
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,360
and the tickets are sold out, it will be too bad.

326
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,020
I booked it.

327
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Do me a favor

328
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,770
and check out the ticketing information.

329
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
How's it? Is there anything wrong?

330
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,800
No.

331
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
Nothing is wrong, of course.

332
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,560
What could possibly go wrong

333
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,880
with the airline's ticketing?

334
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,540
No problem.

335
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,160
Pack your bag.

336
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
I'll call you when dinner is ready.

337
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,120
Sure.

338
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,690
Go. Let me drive you to the airport.

339
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,280
I can take a taxi.

340
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,760
It doesn't matter.

341
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll go to the TV station this afternoon.

342
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,560
And I'm here waiting for you specially.

343
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,960
He didn't have a crush on anyone

344
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,440
during high school?

345
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,280
He wasn't acquainted with any junior girl

346
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,480
two years behind him?

347
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,080
Did Ling Xiao tell you anything?

348
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,800
He seems to have a crush

349
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,900
on one of his juniors by two years.

350
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,600
His junior?

351
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,120
She was his junior by two years

352
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,400
and they knew each other.

353
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,060
Who else could that be but you?

354
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
Now let me ask you.

355
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,960
Mingyue,

356
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,240
do you have a crush on anyone?

357
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,920
Who's him? Do I know him?

358
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,160
You think your mom don't know

359
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,690
what kind of person you are?

360
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,520
You are dilatory and introverted,

361
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,200
having no vision at all.

362
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,240
Even if you meet

363
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
a good young man,

364
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,560
you may not even have the nerves

365
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,090
to ask for his phone number.

366
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
I know.

367
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Leave Li Jianjian to me.

368
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,140
I'll watch her for you.

369
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Thank you. See you later.

370
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,840
Ling Xiao.

371
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,880
I was waiting for you to say it.

372
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
But I think

373
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,000
it's not bad if the girl

374
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,480
break the ice first.

375
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,080
I don't want to waste time

376
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,650
in putting out feelers.

377
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,440
Putting out feelers?

378
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,120
I don't want the ambiguous relationship any longer.

379
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,280
This is my answer.

380
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,120
Qi Mingyue.

381
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,640
I know. Let's talk about it when you are back.

382
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,560
Go. Just go!

383
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Just go!

384
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,780
Ling...

385
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,120
Drive the car away immediately after the passenger gets off.

386
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,200
Sorry. I'm sorry.

387
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,400
Honey, have some coffee.

388
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,609
Thank you, darling.

389
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,280
Good morning.

390
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:21,829
Morning.

391
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,359
Morning.

392
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,520
Li Jianjian, that's a designer bag!

393
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,369
Ziqiu gave it to me!

394
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,800
Damn rich people!

395
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,800
By the way,

396
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,840
has the advertising agency

397
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,600
decided how we should make

398
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,480
their Galloping Horses?

399
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Don't mention it.

400
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,720
I've gone there for three times.

401
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Yesterday, they suddenly told me

402
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,200
they didn't want Galloping Horses any more.

403
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,460
Then what do they want?

404
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
They want Ten Thousand Galloping Horses,

405
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,000
which should be vast and mighty, advancing one after another.

406
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,130
And not a single horse shall be missed!

407
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,240
I did the math.

408
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
If both of us don't eat, drink

409
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,520
or do anything else,

410
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,840
we can make a horse one day

411
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,360
And 365 horses

412
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,840
a year.

413
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,600
So it will take us 27 years and three months

414
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,480
to make 10,000 horses!

415
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Are they going to

416
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,560
spend their lives with horses?

417
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,000
In addition, they'll only give us 50,000 yuan

418
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,060
and a project duration of two months.

419
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,440
Forget it.

420
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,720
Return their deposit.

421
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
Why should we return the deposit?

422
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,760
We've bought the wood

423
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,640
for making Galloping Horses.

424
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,120
The supplier won't take it back.

425
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
It's OK. Put it in the warehouse.

426
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,640
We'll use it later for sure.

427
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,370
Hey, Boss...

428
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,640
Hello. Delivery? Hello.

429
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,820
All right. I'm going downstairs.

430
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,120
Is she stupid?

431
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,200
The client keeps changing their mind.

432
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
We shouldn't return the deposit.

433
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,520
She's an artist.

434
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,280
Artists need bread, too.

435
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,840
No wonder our studio

436
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,480
earns so little

437
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
every month.

438
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,080
When could we get rich?

439
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,960
By the way, I heard from Shuran

440
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,080
that Miss Li's adopted brother Ziqiu

441
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,880
was born with a silver spoon.

442
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
He's very rich.

443
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Maybe one day,

444
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,340
she'll turn up her nose at this chicken feed.

445
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,460
What is this? How large is the box!

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,000
The 21st anniversary of my mom's death is coming.

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
I want to buy some paper money

448
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
and burn them for her.

449
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
Isn't this feudal superstition?

450
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,200
When you are dead, you are dead.

451
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,920
And you don't need any money.

452
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,840
Everyone burns something

453
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,760
at the anniversary of a loved one.

454
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,160
They just want a placebo.

455
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,480
Go, go, go! Get a piece of wood.

456
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
You two...

457
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,360
You caught us.

458
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,400
Zhou Miao carved this for me.

459
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,080
We are in a relationship now.

460
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,770
I found out on the first day.

461
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,960
I really didn't have the idea

462
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,920
at the very beginning.

463
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
I just thought he was a student

464
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,560
and I should help him.

465
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,040
I don't want to listen!

466
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,680
Don't tell me. I don't want to listen!

467
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,560
Just listen to me!

468
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
I don't want to listen!

469
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,120
Listen to me!

470
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,760
Your cakes.

471
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,360
Thanks.

472
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Thank you.

473
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,800
Aunt He Lan?

474
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Aunt He Lan, you are here!

475
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,640
I was worrying you couldn't find the place.

476
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
Ziqiu.

477
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,040
You've grown up into a handsome man.

478
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,800
So nice.

479
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,120
So nice.

480
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,490
Aunt He Lan, what's wrong with you?

481
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,120
Shouldn't you be happy to see your nephew?

482
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm happy. I am.

483
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
Let's go upstairs and have a seat.

484
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,530
Aunt He Lan, come in.

485
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
Do I affect your business?

486
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,560
No.

487
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,440
It was a cafe before.

488
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,840
I just bought the place

489
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,970
and redecorated it.

490
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,680
We had a soft opening one month ago.

491
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,010
The business is not bad.

492
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,700
By the way, Aunt He Lan,

493
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,970
have a taste.

494
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
I made these cakes myself.

495
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,420
See how they taste.

496
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,280
You made them yourself?

497
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,920
Good. Very sweet.

498
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,560
You must have spent much money

499
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,300
in opening such a shop?

500
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,130
Not too much.

501
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,040
The rent, decoration cost and other expenses

502
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
reached about a few hundred thousand in total.

503
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,850
A few hundred thousand?

504
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,920
Seeing you've gone so far,

505
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm really happy for you

506
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,920
from the bottom of my heart.

507
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,960
Incompetent as I was,

508
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,200
I had to let others raise you

509
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,000
when you were young.

510
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,000
I just had no other choice.

511
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm so sorry for you.

512
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,280
Aunt He Lan, why are bringing this up again?

513
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,880
I lived well with my dad.

514
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,140
And I've grown up without any suffering.

515
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,720
Your dad really treats you well.

516
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,330
You did recognize Zhao Huaguang as your biological father,

517
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,240
but you can't

518
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
be ungrateful.

519
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,880
In the future,

520
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,260
you must take care of your dad.

521
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,800
I know. I know.

522
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,680
Ziqiu, this...

523
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,860
Hello, Dad.

524
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,280
Aunt He Lan

525
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,320
is in my shop now.

526
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
OK, OK. We are coming soon.

527
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,160
You are here.

528
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,040
Come in. Come in.

529
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,440
Now I just need to make a soup.

530
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,360
Haichao,

531
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,240
sorry for keeping you from your business.

532
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,080
No,

533
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,140
I've got a chef in the restaurant.

534
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,160
Well, Ziqiu,

535
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
Jianjian called me just now,

536
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,240
saying she would bring many things with her.

537
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,280
You go downstairs to pick her up.

538
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,800
Sure, sure.

539
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,280
Dad,

540
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,760
Aunt He Lan

541
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,490
brings us these wild duck eggs.

542
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,560
It's very nice of you.

543
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,120
I'll go downstairs.

544
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,760
Go.

545
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,480
You really don't have to

546
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,410
bring these heavy things with you.

547
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,680
These eggs were not laid

548
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,240
by ducks that eat feedstuffs.

549
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
I asked Liubao to pick these wild duck eggs

550
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,880
in the mountains specially.

551
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,740
They are tasty.

552
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,400
These are good things.

553
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,680
Come in. Have a seat. Have a seat.

554
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,810
Hurry up and come in.

555
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
The lunch will be ready

556
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
in ten minutes,

557
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
so I don't make tea for you.

558
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,930
Here, drink some water.

559
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,040
Ziqiu has been a good boy since childhood,

560
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,100
doing homework without being asked.

561
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
Yes.

562
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,760
But,

563
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,840
it was not good for him to become thoughtful

564
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,900
at such a young age.

565
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,970
That made him suffer a lot with grown-ups.

566
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
This is all my elder sister's fault.

567
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,080
Never mind. Forget it.

568
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
He Mei

569
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,240
has never

570
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,680
contacted you, right?

571
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,760
No, she hasn't.

572
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,840
When she left,

573
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,250
she sent us a letter,

574
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,400
telling us to see her as a dead person.

575
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,160
She has a strong character.

576
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,320
Even if she doesn't live well,

577
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,300
she would rather hang herself

578
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,080
than come to us brazenly.

579
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Don't say that.

580
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
Frequent shifts make a tree dead but a person prosperous.

581
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
I guess she lives well.

582
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,320
Why do we keep talking about her?

583
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,680
Ziqiu won't be happy to hear this.

584
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,480
Right. Let's not talk about her.

585
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Haichao,

586
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,760
don't blame Ziqiu.

587
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,160
You are bringing

588
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,960
the conversation back to Ziqiu.

589
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
Ziqiu left with Zhao Huaguang

590
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
when he graduated

591
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
from high school.

592
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,840
He did that just for his study.

593
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,120
You see, he left and came back.

594
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,360
It means he has a conscience.

595
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,880
As the saying goes,

596
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,440
a man will love his adopted parents more than his biological parents.

597
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,240
You are right.

598
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,240
Anyway,

599
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
I was only glad

600
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,880
when Ziqiu got the chance to study abroad.

601
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,600
Besides,

602
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Zhao Huaguang is Ziqiu's biological father

603
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
at any rate.

604
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,760
It's good that

605
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,860
he has one more father to love him.

606
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,760
Haichao,

607
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,600
you are such a good man.

608
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,520
Everything happened

609
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,080
because we were incompetent at that time.

610
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,720
Don't say that!

611
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,760
You don't have to dwell on

612
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,820
the past problems.

613
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,820
Forget it. Just forget it.

614
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,080
Well, how are your families?

615
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,400
What happened? Everything alright?

616
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,840
Haichao,

617
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,360
my husband

618
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,380
was diagnosed with gastric cancer in March.

619
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,920
He had an operation in the hospital last month.

620
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,840
Next week, he'll start the chemotherapy.

621
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,800
This is a big deal.

622
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,200
Why didn't you tell me?

623
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,600
I...

624
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm really ashamed

625
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,420
to trouble you guys again.

626
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,560
To be honest, Haichao,

627
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
I came to Ziqiu this time

628
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,960
not just to pay him a visit,

629
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,540
but to borrow some money from him.

630
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,120
I've borrowed money

631
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,850
from every possible relative.

632
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,320
Now they are even avoiding me

633
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,450
because I've borrowed too much money.

634
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,320
I really have no other option.

635
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,480
Have you told Ziqiu about this?

636
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,720
I find it too hard to tell him.

637
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,960
Great. You didn't tell him.

638
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,920
That's great.

639
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,200
It's not easy for Ziqiu

640
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,360
to come back and start a business.

641
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,490
He's got many things that costs money.

642
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,800
Don't worry.

643
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,860
How about this?

644
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,640
I still have some spare money.

645
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,040
Tell me how much you need.

646
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,720
No, Haichao.

647
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Why not?

648
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,240
This is about saving a life.

649
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
Just tell me how much.

650
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,660
I need 20,000 yuan.

651
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Is it possible?

652
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,400
If not, you can lend me less.

653
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,040
It's OK. I'll get back the money for financial products.

654
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,560
Dad.

655
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,100
Just leave it to me.

656
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,760
I have money.

657
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
No, you don't.

658
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,120
You've just come back to start your business.

659
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Dad, it's OK!

660
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,160
Ziqiu,

661
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,120
I really have no other option.

662
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,520
Aunt He Lan, don't say that.

663
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,080
It's OK.

664
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,840
By the way,

665
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,760
when will Uncle

666
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,800
start the chemotherapy?

667
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,920
We've booked the ward bed.

668
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,760
The chemotherapy will begin in next week.

669
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,360
All right.

670
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,120
I shall visit and look after him

671
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,850
by that time.

672
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
I can also help, Aunt He Lan.

673
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,930
Please feel free to call me.

674
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,240
Thank you, Jianjian.

675
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
What a good girl!

676
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,080
-Just like me. -Just like my mom.

677
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,520
Like your mom? Come on!

678
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,980
Your mom was so beautiful.

679
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,360
So I look like her!

680
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,560
I'm beautiful too.

681
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,640
You are beautiful?

682
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,560
Dad, you see?

683
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,240
Dad, am I?

684
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
Aunt He Lan, I look pretty, right?

685
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,730
Change your shoes quickly!

686
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,160
Hurry up! Let's have lunch.

687
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520

688
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
Please wait a moment.

689
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,560
Continue or not, please select.

690
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,760
Please select a service.

691
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,520
Please type the amount.

692
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,840
Please wait a moment.

693
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,420
Thank you for your use.

694
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,560
Please get your card back.

695
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,720
Hello, sir. Take a seat, please.

696
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,240
What type of service do you need?

697
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,040
I want to withdraw cash.

698
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,640
All right.

699
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,900
Aunt He Lan,

700
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,920
I bought

701
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,600
some royal jelly and albumen powder

702
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,320
for Uncle.

703
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,440
Nourish him with these things by that time.

704
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,920
And I put the money

705
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,720
in this bag.

706
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,080
Take it.

707
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
Thank you, Ziqiu.

708
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,720
No problem.

709
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,760
This is the receipt for 20,000 yuan.

710
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,480
I've written it. Take it.

711
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,760
Aunt He Lan, I don't need the receipt.

712
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
When the ducks

713
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
can be sold,

714
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,320
our financial situation will get better.

715
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,240
By that time,

716
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,900
I'll return the money to you as soon as possible.

717
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Fine, Aunt He Lan.

718
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,400
By that time,

719
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,040
you just return 20,000 yuan to me.

720
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,320
Nothing less.

721
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,800
Here's the bus.

722
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,280
Aunt He Lan,

723
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,880
when Uncle starts

724
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
the chemotherapy here,

725
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,440
don't forget to tell me.

726
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,520
I shall pay him a visit.

727
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,640
Get in the bus. Get in.

728
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,320
Go back.

729
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,920
OK.

730
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,050
It's OK. Let me watch you get in the bus.

731
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,360
For some people,

732
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,560
life is too difficult.

733
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,440
As the promotion has ended recently,

734
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,400
it's normal

735
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,480
to have less customers.

736
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,880
I hope everyone keep working hard.

737
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,640
Don't let up.

738
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,540
Come on.

739
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
Go! Go! Go!

740
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,140
OK, you are dismissed.

741
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Boss,

742
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
we just got paid today.

743
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,200
So we are going to have dinner and sing karaoke together.

744
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,460
Are you coming with us?

745
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm not going today.

746
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,720
Later, I have something to do

747
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,580
with my sister.

748
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
You guys have fun.

749
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,840
I wish I had an elder brother

750
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,760
like our boss.

751
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,100
Our boss has a sister complex.

752
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Don't you know that?

753
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
I know!

754
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,480
You know nothing.

755
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,640
There is no blood relationship

756
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,120
between our boss and his sister.

757
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,280
Our boss is a foster son.

758
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Don't talk nonsense!

759
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,640
It's true.

760
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,200
His lawyer friend said so.

761
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
Our pay day is also coming

762
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,160
in two days.

763
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,720
You situation is not that bad,

764
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
since you have only one employee in your studio.

765
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,760
Both you and your senior

766
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,820
are owners, right?

767
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Don't mention it.

768
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,320
We didn't hire

769
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,120
an employee.

770
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,920
We got ourselves a boss!

771
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,120
He either asks for leave or comes late.

772
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,520
My senior thinks I don't know that

773
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,880
she often help the guy with his work

774
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,680
after she finishes her own work.

775
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,290
Something must be wrong with her mind.

776
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,820
Love is all for her.

777
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
If you are not the same with her,

778
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,460
just break up with Shuran.

779
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Here we go again.

780
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,160
I'm upset now.

781
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,600
Stop nagging.

782
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Why are you upset?

783
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,140
I don't know if Ling Xiao has got home.

784
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,520
The plane landed

785
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,480
an hour ago,

786
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,640
so he should be at home right now.

787
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,360
Coming!

788
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,440
You are back.

789
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,320
Mom.

790
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
The food is ready. We are waiting for you.

791
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,320
Come in.

792
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,840
Chengzi, your brother is back!

793
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,000
Let's have the meal.

794
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Chengzi!

795
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,280
Come on.

796
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,000
Chengzi!

797
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Why did you lock the door?

798
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Open the door!

799
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,320
Don't burst into my room.

800
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
Can you do that?

801
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,680
What do you mean by saying so?

802
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,680
Can't I...

803
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,880
Can't I

804
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
enter your room?

805
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,020
Your brother is tired.

806
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,410
Don't let him serve you.

807
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,600
Say thank you.

808
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,280
Thank you.

809
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,000
Where's your luggage?

810
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
Did you leave it outside the door?

811
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
I have no luggage.

812
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,240
No luggage?

813
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,340
Let's have the meal first.

814
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Why didn't you bring your luggage with you?

815
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,320
Answer me. I'm asking you.

816
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,560
Do you want us to eat or not?

817
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm talking to your brother!

818
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,980
You are insane.

819
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,080
Is your dad sick?

820
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,560
No.

821
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,680
Ling Heping told you

822
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,640
not to come back?

823
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,150
But why didn't he

824
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,760
tell me

825
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,000
when I called him?

826
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,610
It has nothing to do with my dad.

827
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,159
This is not for Li Jianjian, right?

828
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,960
Are you crazy?

829
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,630
you can think about

830
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,400
your relationship later.

831
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
This is about your future.

832
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,960
How could you quit

833
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
such a good job without hesitation?

834
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,480
You know how difficult it is to get the job!

835
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,000
You just quit it?

836
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,440
I've already found a job

837
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
at home.

838
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
At home?

839
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,360
What do you mean?

840
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,630
This is not your home, right?

841
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,320
I've been with you for so long

842
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,210
and this is still not your home, right?

843
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Don't answer the phone!

844
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
Mom, stop it! What are you doing?

845
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,320
Mom, don't be like this! Mom!

846
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,210
He didn't answer the phone.

847
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,800
I could get through a moment ago.

848
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,530
Why couldn't I get through now?

849
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Maybe he has a bad connection at home?

850
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,120
Sorry,

851
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,180
The number you dialed is out of...

852
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,360
I was wondering

853
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,490
how Ling Xiao would talk to his mother.

854
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,800
Me too.

855
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,280
Why don't you make a phone call and ask him?

856
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,680
I called, but I couldn't get through.

857
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,340
I called him a couple of times.

858
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,640
Haichao, I want to ask you something.

859
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,240
You have to be honest with me.

860
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,640
Over the years,

861
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,920
have you always been

862
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,180
thinking about He Mei?

863
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,080
Be serious.

864
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,600
I am serious.

865
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,640
I thought it over.

866
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,920
You two are really well matched.

867
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,200
You see,

868
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,640
you are like a mother hen

869
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,370
who worries about everything.

870
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,240
While He Mei

871
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,400
leaves everything to others.

872
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,440
I'm so serious.

873
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,720
Come on!

874
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,480
She and Zhao Huaguang are well matched.

875
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,800
Don't mention Zhao Huaguang.

876
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,580
He's nothing but a rogue who lives off women.

877
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,400
I wonder

878
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,160
what He Mei was thinking at that time.

879
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,680
You see,

880
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,920
she asked you

881
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,320
to persuade Ziqiu to recognize his biological father.

882
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,960
This is...

883
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,370
In addition,

884
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
you didn't tell Ziqiu

885
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,080
about He Mei's return at that time, did you?

886
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,680
How should I say to him?

887
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,200
He Mei's attitude

888
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,720
would only hurt him again.

889
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
Why should I?

890
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,000
How about this?

891
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,600
Can you do me a favor

892
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,720
and ask about He Mei's location?

893
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,560
What do you mean?

894
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,360
No, you misunderstand me.

895
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,360
I saw Ziqiu kept the makeup mirror

896
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,440
his mother left him.

897
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,840
So I think

898
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
he may want to

899
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,200
meet his mother all the time.

900
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,480
Besides, He Mei

901
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,120
returned me the money

902
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
last time.

903
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,320
I can't tell Ziqiu about it.

904
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
So I always feel sorry

905
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,920
in my heart.

906
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,120
You...

907
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,700
You are like the Virgin Mary as they say on the internet.

908
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,320
What Mary?

909
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,680
Virgin Mary.

910
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,320
What's that?

911
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,200
It means

912
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,360
you are a nice guy and a pushover.

913
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
You are right.

914
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,000
You can't always be the Virgin Mary.

915
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,720
Right.

916
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,720
Fine. I'll take your advice.

917
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,320
That's the right thing to do.

918
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,640
I'll return

919
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,520
your board expenses.

920
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,050
You may go to the next door and have your meals.

921
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,700
No, no! Bro!

922
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,600
How about this? I apologize.

923
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,280
My fault.

924
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,240
I'll ask around her location for you right now.

925
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,410
Shell the beans.

926
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,480
I told Ling Xiao my feelings today.

927
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,620
You told your feelings...

928
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,680
Your feelings!

929
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,960
When?

930
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,440
When I drove him to the airport.

931
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,520
What a good time!

932
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,600
I just felt

933
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,200
it was not going to work

934
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,720
if we continue this ambiguous relationship.

935
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
You know,

936
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,720
Ling Xiao is cool

937
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,800
and shy.

938
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,240
If I had waited for him to express his feelings,

939
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,600
how long could I have waited?

940
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,400
So I spoke out my feelings first.

941
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,720
Stop writing! Are you that busy?

942
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,720
What did he say?

943
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,440
I told him to give me an answer after he comes back.

944
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,120
But I think,

945
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,640
I may have scared him.

946
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,600
Scared him?

947
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,280
Are you talking about Ling Xiao?

948
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,040
You are upset?

949
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,280
Why?

950
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,340
I can't get through to my brother.

951
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
I knew it!

952
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,860
Everything was fine before he came back.

953
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,280
After he came back,

954
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,960
Li Jianjian was really under the thumb.

955
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,680
He's only been away for one day,

956
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,600
and you are so upset.

957
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,650
What a disaster!

958
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,480
Who's a disaster?

959
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,320
He's just been away for one day.

960
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,250
It doesn't mean he won't come back.

961
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,440
And you!

962
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,880
Why don't you fall in love with someone else?

963
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,960
Does it has to be a nerd with a sister complex?

964
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,880
Just wait to be jealous of your sister-in-law

965
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,040
in the future!
