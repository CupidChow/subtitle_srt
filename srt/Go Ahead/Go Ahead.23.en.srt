[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,020
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,980
Episode 23

4
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,960
Have some tea first.

5
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
They'll be here soon.

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,360
Thank you, Aunt.

7
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,160
This is it?

8
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,960
Yes, come on.

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,080
Xiuying.

10
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,200
Come on.

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,440
Have some tea first.

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,900
Coming.

13
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
There you are, Can.

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Hello, Aunt.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,160
She's busy and I asked her not to come.

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,920
But she said Zhuang Bei had no time to accompany me,

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
so she has to do it.

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,880
I like playing mahjong.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
Besides,

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,600
you said

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,640
that you would make delicious food for me.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
All right.

23
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,210
Let's play mahjong.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
Sit in that seat as usual.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Come.

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,760
How many rounds are we going to play today?

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,200
You know what,

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm very,

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,880
very happy today.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,160
When I played mahjong

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
with them

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,200
before,

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,680
they were like two leading roles

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,120
in comic dialogue

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,040
and I was like a supporting role.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,079
But this time, I was the leading role.

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll return the necklace to you.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
No need, Aunt.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,660
I especially bought this for you.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
I'll discuss this

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
with Zhuang Bei.

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,640
Besides, they will

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
definitely tell everyone about it

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,600
in your residential quarter,

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
so I think you should wear it.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
You're right.

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,370
You are quite considerate.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,080
I've been wanting to ask you since the last time we met.

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,280
You're so beautiful

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,560
and kind-hearted,

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,920
so why don't you do something better

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,840
than running errands like this?

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
To be honest with you, Aunt,

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm experiencing life now.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm an actress.

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Really?

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,560
What have you played?

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,079
I played a lot of roles when I was little.

59
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,340
Some are widely known,

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,280
like Memory of My Father, Spring Grass

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
and Traditional Chinese Medicine Family.

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,400
I've watched all of them.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,079
Those movies were made a dozen years ago.

64
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,160
What roles did you play?

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,120
I played

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,640
the heroine in Memory of My Father

67
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
when she was little.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,040
In Spring Grass, I played

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
the little beggar

70
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,880
who goes begging

71
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,360
with the heroine when she was little.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,280
In Traditional Chinese Medicine Family,

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,140
I played the youngest daughter of the leading role.

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,760
I remember that.

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,420
The girl with big eyes,

76
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680
she looks very cute,

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
just like a doll.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
You did watch them!

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,480
Yes.

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
Actually, I did a lot of commercials

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
during my junior middle school and high school days.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll tell you one

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,160
which you definitely know.

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,080
That is

85
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,540
a commercial of ice cream,

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
which has a yellow cover,

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,640
and I hold the ice cream like this in it.

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,070
Yeah, the girl

89
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,600
in red...

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,120
Tang Can.

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,720
Zhuang Bei?

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,840
Didn't we agree to meet in the restaurant?

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,600
I know it's hard

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,480
to take a taxi near my home.

95
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,080
Get in.

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,409
I'm leaving now.

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,480
Don't forget to turn off the lights

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,640
and lock the door before you leave.

99
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,040
Mr. He,

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,200
a madam wants to meet you.

101
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Sit down.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
You were just as tall as my waist

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,240
when I left.

104
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
No.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
I was as tall as your chest.

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,440
Really?

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
I might have got it wrong.

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,450
You didn't get it wrong.

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,850
You just don't remember it.

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Is Zhao Huaguang kind to you?

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,460
You were married with him,

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,930
but you didn't tell him that you had a baby.

113
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,500
So you must be clear what kind of person he is.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
How did he agree

115
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,100
to let you come back and live with Li Haichao?

116
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,810
That's impossible.

117
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,920
His family needs someone

118
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
to inherit the family property.

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,140
You came back on your own, didn't you?

120
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
He can't stop me.

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
He's not

122
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
a good man,

123
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,760
but he's a rich man.

124
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,340
I don't want his money!

125
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Unlike you.

126
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Why did you want to see me?

127
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
Li Haichao

128
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,080
must have told you

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,810
about my situation now, right?

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,720
Yes.

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
But I want to

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
make this clear with you personally

133
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,340
and put an end to it.

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
I think,

135
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,360
when I abandoned you

136
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,840
the other day,

137
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,320
I had put an end to our relationship.

138
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
That's for you,

139
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,440
but not for me.

140
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
I have a question

141
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,170
which has been troubling me

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,920
for so many years.

143
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,960
You ask it.

144
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,500
When you went to Shenzhen,

145
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,280
you said you would come back to get me

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,610
after you settled down.

147
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,000
But why did you

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
write a letter saying

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,680
that you didn't want me anymore?

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,159
I was too positive about it

151
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,760
when I first got to Shenzhen.

152
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I thought I could find a way out

153
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
once I got there.

154
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,760
I was not well-educated

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,880
and I shared an apartment

156
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,600
with a dozen of people

157
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
at that time.

158
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,920
I couldn't even take care of myself back then,

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,780
so how could I take care of a child?

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,100
So I was a burden to you?

161
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Or did you decide to leave me to my dad

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
for my own good?

163
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,600
Does it matter to you?

164
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,760
Anyway,

165
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,600
I just want you to tell me the truth.

166
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,200
The truth is

167
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,030
that I just couldn't

168
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,000
take care of you anymore

169
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,240
at that time.

170
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,409
That's why I abandoned you.

171
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,760
I was in no position to think about it

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
and I didn't have the time to,

173
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,160
so I just did it by instinct.

174
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,010
What else could I have done?

175
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
So when you abandoned me,

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,580
it was for our own good.

177
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,080
Yeah, it was good for both of us.

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
It was a right choice.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,600
OK.

180
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,570
I've got an answer from you.

181
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,010
Now I can put an end to it.

182
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,040
By the way,

183
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
my dad has told me

184
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,890
that you've returned the money

185
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,880
and you have another son.

186
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,520
As you see,

187
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm already a grown-up.

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,160
I have important family members too

189
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,680
and my career.

190
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
You don't need me,

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,690
and I don't need you either.

192
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,180
You didn't take care of me before,

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,240
so I won't take care of you in the future.

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,040
Don't worry.

195
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,740
I have another son,

196
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,320
so I don't need you to take care of me.

197
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,120
OK, that's fine.

198
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,580
Take this back.

199
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,360
Thank you

201

Mingyue!

228
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,730
Li Jianjian!

229
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,280
What's wrong?

230
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,840
My knee hit a stone.

231
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,440
Get up.

232
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,000
No, no

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
I can't get up.

234
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
My legs are numb.

235
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,690
Why did you crouch here?

236
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,480
I've been standing here,

237
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
waiting for you for over an hour.

238
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,800
And I'm exhausted.

239
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,410
Who asked you to stand here?

240
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,600
You didn't answer my calls

241
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,960
and you didn't reply to my messages on WeChat,

242
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,440
so I had no choice but waiting for you

243
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,100
at the gate of your apartment.

244
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,440
Don't move.

245
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,120
Don't move.

246
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,640
My legs are numb. I can't move.

247
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,200
Stand up.

248
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,920
My legs are numb.

249
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,880
What's going on here, Mingyue?

250
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,800
My classmate's legs are numb, Aunt.

251
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
You are out for a walk?

252
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
Yeah. Take your classmate back.

253
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,560
OK.

254
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,280
Goodbye, Aunt.

255
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
Get off me.

256
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,400
To your home?

257
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,680
No way.

258
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,760
Don't move.

259
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,520
Give me a moment.

260
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,440
That hurts.

261
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,820
Hold still.

262
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,800
Don't move away.

263
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,040
Ling Xiao told you?

264
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,280
I saw the message

265
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
you sent to him on WeChat.

266
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,760
Why did he show you

267
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,080
the message I sent to him?

268
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Or you can even read

269
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,880
whatever messages

270
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,080
on his mobile now?

271
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,120
No, it's not like that.

272
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,160
His mobile was broken,

273
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
then he bought a new one.

274
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,880
While I was helping him

275
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,000
install the Apps,

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,400
I read the message by accident.

277
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,960
All right,

278
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,520
he showed me the message.

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,330
What do you mean by this?

280
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
I helped you

281
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
get back together,

282
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,400
But now you just

283
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,800
watch me making a fool of myself

284
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
without telling me?

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,480
Are you on purpose?

286
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,280
Are you making fun of me?

287
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,360
Mingyue!

288
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,000
We've been friends for years,

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,560
and you should know me better than this.

290
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,000
I would never do that to you!

291
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Li Jianjian!

292
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,600
I've been thinking about it these days.

293
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
I think

294
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
that I was just an idiot

295
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,800
to help you two get back together.

296
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,880
How could you two need my help with it?

297
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,480
Now the two of you

298
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,720
are just lying to me together.

299
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
No,

300
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
it's not what you think.

301
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,320
I didn't find it out

302
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,680
until you did.

303
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,320
I've never expected

304
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,080
that both of my elder brothers

305
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,480
would be in love with me.

306
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,370
He Ziqiu is in love with you too?

307
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,120
Yes.

308
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
This is absurd, isn't it?

309
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,880
I wonder what he thinks.

310
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,880
Li Jianjian,

311
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,200
you're here

312
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
to show off.

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,960
You know clearly

314
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,200
that I had a crush on He Ziqiu

315
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,080
when I was in high school!

316
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,560
Are you here to show off?

317
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,720
You are particularly happy

318
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,640
to see me like this?

319
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm not happy.

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,760
If I'm happy,

321
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,800
I wouldn't have been here waiting for you

322
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
for over an hour.

323
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,440
How could you say that?

324
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
How could you think of me like that?

325
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,920
I've never been

326
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,180
so humiliated before.

327
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,480
No,

328
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
you can't do this.

329
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,800
The three of you

330
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
can't do this.

331
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Well, are you crazy, Qi Mingyue?

332
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,560
You're the one who's crazy!

333
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't want to talk to you again!

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,520
Do you think I want to?

335
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,580
You came here to see me.

336
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,010
The one who came to see the other is a puppy.

337
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,560
It doesn't matter.

338
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,720
Your mother just doesn't want

339
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,760
to be embarrassed.

340
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,280
You didn't see how boastful those women were

341
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,480
when they talked about their children.

342
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,980
It was not easy for your mom

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,930
to have hanged in there for so long.

344
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
By the way, did you lose money today?

345
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,240
My mom said that you lost money the last time.

346
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,160
You don't earn much,

347
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
and I can't let you lose money like this.

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm lucky today and I won some money!

349
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,480
Besides, when playing mahjong,

350
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,120
it's normal to win or lose.

351
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,960
OK.

352
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,240
You know what,

353
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,480
my mom likes you a lot.

354
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,480
She even wants

355
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
to switch us.

356
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,560
No one likes me.

357
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,720
Well, my mom is definitely willing to do so.

358
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,640
You are such an excellent lawyer,

359
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,280
and she'll be happy about it.

360
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm telling you,

361
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,520
you are fooled.

362
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,280
In the movies and TV plays,

363
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,349
those lawyers

364
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,400
can easily earn lots of money

365
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,000
at a young age.

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,130
But that's not true.

367
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,880
Look at me,

368
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm as busy as a bee every day.

369
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,160
But I make very little money. My master gets most of it.

370
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,619
I just make some hard cash.

371
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,960
But you have a stable job,

372
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,500
and you are hard-working.

373
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,640
Unlike me.

374
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,819
What's wrong with you?

375
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
Every parent is worried

376
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,970
that their children can't do well.

377
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,560
Really?

378
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,320
Ling Xiao and Ziqiu's parents are special cases

379
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,520
and are not included .

380
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
Well, I'm a special case too.

381
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,520
Why?

382
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
My mother wanted me

383
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,640
to do more commercials before

384
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,520
to make her proud before.

385
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,360
Now she just wants me not

386
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
to embarrass her no matter what I do.

387
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,080
I think your mother just doesn't know

388
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,400
how to express herself.

389
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,660
In the eyes of a parent,

390
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,040
their children are young,

391
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
naive and lack of social experience,

392
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,080
but they do everything for our own good.

393
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,880
So I should live my life

394
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
the way she wants?

395
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,880
That's not what I meant.

396
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,840
I mean,

397
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,080
they want nothing but good for us.

398
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,880
Sometimes

399
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,360
we should put ourselves

400
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,560
in their shoes.

401
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Sorry, I,

402
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,560
I shouldn't have said so much about your life.

403
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,520
No. I think you are right.

404
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,080
You don't have to walk me home.

405
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
Don't you still have to deal with a case?

406
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,280
Go back home.

407
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
It's fine.

408
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
Since I've got here,

409
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,200
I want

410
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
to talk about something with Ziqiu.

411
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,360
Well, Mingyue just bought some good tea.

412
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll make a cup for you.

413
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:33,960
OK.

414
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,040
What has Mingyue been busy with lately?

415
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,480
She hasn't replied to my messages on WeChat.

416
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,720
What do you want to see her about?

417
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,800
Last time I asked her

418
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,840
to inquire about the TV station recruitment.

419
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,480
I want to thank her for her help.

420
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,610
She's been at her parents' these days.

421
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,640
She's not here?

422
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,800
Don't mind it.

423
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,040
That is just a piece of cake for Mingyue.

424
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,800
Tang Can.

425
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
It's late now,

426
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
so I think I should go back

427
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
and deal with my case.

428
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,080
OK.

429
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,440
Well, go upstairs.

430
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
I've got to go.

431
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,520
Goodbye.

432
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Bye.

433
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,640
Well,

434
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,840
he said he wanted to see He Ziqiu,

435
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,920
but he just wanted

436
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,000
to walk me home.

437
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,880
Li Jianjian?

438
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Li Jianjian!

439
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,400
What happened?

440
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,680
Who bullied you?

441
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
Let me see.

442
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
My baby girl...

443
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,280
Let me see.

444
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,720
What happened? Who bullied you?

445
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,080
Why are you crying like this?

446
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,340
I feel so sorry for you.

447
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Girls like us might bleed,

448
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680
but never sheds tears.

449
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
Don't cry.

450
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,960
Who bullied you?

451
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,640
Tell me

452
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,200
who bullied you,

453
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,530
and I'll go beat them up.

454
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,880
Anyone home?

455
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,640
Come on out! Now!

456
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,610
Anyone home?

457
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440
Are you deaf?

458
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Can't you hear your sister

459
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
crying so loudly?

460
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Were you dead?

461
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,080
Go now!

462
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,600
What's wrong?

463
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,640
Come here.

464
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,600
What's wrong?

465
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,840
Don't cry.

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,680
Why did you hit me?

467
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,740
You take care of it.

468
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,080
Alright.

469
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,560
Tell me. What happened?

470
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
Mingyue...

471
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,840
She called me a puppy.

472
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,240
You went to see her?

473
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,400
It's all your fault.

474
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,200
Jianjian,

475
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,420
let's talk over there.

476
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Let's go.

477
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,960
Here. Put this on your eyes.

478
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,020
Otherwise they'll swell tomorrow morning.

479
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,640
Better now?

480
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,240
Right now,

481
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,400
Qi Mingyue must be feeling embarrassed.

482
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,860
When she calms down later,

483
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
I'll apologize to her properly.

484
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
You don't like her.

485
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,280
It won't help even if you apologize.

486
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
I can't control

487
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,360
who I like.

488
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,560
Look at this.

489
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,650
Look how hard you bit me.

490
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,040
Are you a dog?

491
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,640
Does it hurt?

492
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,920
Yes. Rub it for me.

493
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,440
Well,

494
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,640
why did you mess with me

495
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,840
while I was mad?

496
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,810
You brought it on yourself.

497
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,520
Your hand is cold.

498
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,560
I was holding this.

499
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,560
Don't move.

500
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,520
Do you want me to rub it or not?

501
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,960
Yes.

502
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm home.

503
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
Ziqiu.

504
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,360
Li Jianjian, did you cry?

505
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,240
No.

506
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,450
It's fine. She had a fight with Qi Mingyue.

507
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,000
You always fight

508
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,530
and then get back together.

509
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
You girls are unbelievable.

510
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,520
Well, I met Aunt He today.

511
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Aunt He?

512
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,900
The one who almost became your step-mother.

513
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,740
Haven't you told her about it?

514
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
I haven't got the chance to.

515
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,280
Mr. Li told me today that

516
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,810
he had found Aunt He Mei.

517
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,440
So how is she?

518
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,200
Did she say anything?

519
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,460
She's pretty well.

520
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,400
She came back and she has run a beauty salon

521
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,660
for two years already.

522
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,700
She got married

523
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
and has a four-year-old son.

524
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,160
If dad had not gone to see her,

525
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,280
she probably wouldn't

526
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,160
have come to see me at all.

527
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,000
I talked to her today,

528
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,260
mainly to tell her that

529
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,090
I'm pretty well.

530
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
And since she's married,

531
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,960
we should take good

532
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
care of ourselves,

533
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,090
and we'll just be strangers to each other.

534
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,880
Why are you staring at me like that?

535
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm fine.

536
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,440
She abandoned me when I was little.

537
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,560
But I survived.

538
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,320
I don't need her.

539
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,300
I'm going to take a shower.

540
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, give me

541
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,090
a massage on my shoulder in a while.

542
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,720
Ziqiu.

543
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,960
Ziqiu, I've got you some chocolate.

544
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,620
Sweets will make you feel better.

545
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
I'm leaving now.

546
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
I've brought only one piece.

547
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,760
Mom is the best in the world.

548
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,640
Children are treasure in their mothers' eyes.

549
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,560
When we're in our mothers' arms.

550
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,080
we're the happiest.

551
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,320
Thank you all.

552
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,720
Now, let's welcome Wang Doudou

553
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,320
to present us "My Great Mom."

554
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,960
My great mom

555
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,560
is back home from work.

556
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,600
She must be so tired after a day's work.

557
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,240
Mom, mom, sit down.

558
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,720
Mom, mom, sit down.

559
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,720
Have a cup of tea.

560
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,880
You ugly pig!

561
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
He Ziqiu is abandoned by his mother!

562
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,120
He Ziqiu is abandoned by his mother!

563
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,040
He Ziqiu is abandoned by his mother!

564
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,960
He Ziqiu is abandoned by his mother!

565
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,680
He Ziqiu...

566
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
♫Those dreams full of love♫

567
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,920

569

593
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,960
Jun,

594
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,560
I remember your English

595
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,820
is pretty good, right?

596
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,560
You can handle travel.

597
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,200
What about business negotiation?

598
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,880
I mean dealing with

599
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
a foreigner.

600
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,360
Do you have any friends

601
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,920
who are good at English?

602
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,600
OK. No problem.

603
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,520
It's OK.

604
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
I've got to go now.

605
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,560
Who else do I have?

606
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,680
Juan,

607
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
should I clean the raw material room?

608
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,880
Think about

609
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,520
which one of your friends

610
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,580
is good at English.

611
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,040
Miss Li's brother, Ziqiu

612
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,600
studied abroad, right?

613
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,880
Oh, yes.

614
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,920
Good morning.

615
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,360
Jianjian,

616
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,200
well, our interpreter can't come

617
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,440
because he has things to handle.

618
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,160
Call your brother

619
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Ziqiu, who

620
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,840
studied abroad

621
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,320
and ask him to be our interpreter.

622
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,560
I don't think it's necessary.

623
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,240
Our customer will bring

624
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,520
his own interpreter.

625
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,520
His interpreter will certainly

626
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,080
help his own boss only.

627
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,520
What if

628
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,400
he fools us

629
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,960
because we don't understand English?

630
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,160
It's all about money.

631
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,040
In a business negotiation, we have to know ourselves and our counterpart.

632
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,880
But I'm not sure

633
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,360
if Ziqiu has free time now.

634
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,400
Ask him.

635
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,680
Come on. Call him.

636
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,760
Hi, Ziqiu.

637
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,480
Are you in the shop?

638
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,780
You haven't left home yet?

639
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,720
Then, can you come

640
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,920
to my studio

641
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
and do me a favor?

642
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Excuse me.

643
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
What's wrong?

644
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,040
Isn't there going to be a business negotiation?

645
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,600
Am I being

646
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,720
weird?

647
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,600
No, not at all.

648
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,000
It's very good and very impressive.

649
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,040
Don't move.

650
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,000
Let me take a picture.

651
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,040
There's no need for that.

652
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,280
Pretty cool.

653
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,320
I'm impressed.

654
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Really?

655
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,100
Thank you. I'm flattered.

656
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,360
We're not flattering you.

657
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,280
If you go on the street,

658
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,540
even strangers will be impressed by you.

659
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
You're being overly exaggerating.

660
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,680
Get back to your work.

661
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,380
Please, be seated.

662
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,920
Here, right?

663
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,520
Yes, yes.

664
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,810
Jianjian, sit here.

665
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,340
Even your sofa is so esthetic.

666
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,440
So, let me walk you through

667
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,360
our process.

668
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,120
OK.

669
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,080
When our customer is here,

670
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,520
introduce us first

671
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,880
and then

672
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,760
our studio's

673
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,880
main business scope.

674
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,760
No problem.

675
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,860
I've written it down. Please read it.

676
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,920
There's so much.

677
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,640
OK.

678
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
It seems... not complicated.

679
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,440
The most important thing is

680
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,960
to help us

681
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,320
get a good price.

682
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,560
My ideal price and the lowest price

683
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,720
are both written here.

684
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,520
You can improvise.

685
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,920
Our top priority is to strike a deal.

686
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,120
OK?

687
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,960
OK.

688
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,920
The war is coming.

689
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,320
I'll go and fix my makeup.

690
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,560
What?

691
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,580
Smell my hairs.

692
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,540
Does it smell good?

693
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,040
Try again.

694
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,800
Yes.

695
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
I haven't washed my hairs for three days.

696
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,080
He Ziqiu,

697
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,120
I'll kill you.

698
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,200
How can you use violence here?

699
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,960
Stop.

700
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,440
I'm thirsty. Get me some water.

701
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,400
How dare you...

702
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,090
How can you beat your interpreter?

703
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,040
Your book here seems

704
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,170
quite interesting.

705
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,540
Perplexed by My Brother's...

706
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,300
What are you doing?

707
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,400
Well... don't touch Du Juan's book.

708
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,880
Du Juan's book?

709
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
It's OK. I'll just take a glimpse.

710
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,120
Why?

711
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,920
This is for girls.

712
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,720
You think it's suitable for you to read it?

713
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,080
Why can't I read

714
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,880
a comic book for girls?

715
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,440
Of course not.

716
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
You're not a girl.

717
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,720
You're a businessman now.

718
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,800
A businessman! A...

719
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,960
What's the problem?

720
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,120
Stop it.

721
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,490
The customer is coming.

722
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,679
All right.

723
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,320
Thanks for coming.

724
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,250
You're welcome.

725
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm just so glad to

726
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,530
reach a consensus with you.

727
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,120
Your business philosophy

728
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,630
and our creative ideas are

729
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,920
in perfect harmony.

730
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
So I believe our cooperation will be

731
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,920
very pleasant.

732
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,040
Mainly because I like

733
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,280
Li Jianjian's work.

734
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,710
The first time I saw it,

735
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,080
I wanted to put it on

736
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
my porch cabinet.

737
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,159
That's great.

738
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
See you next time.

739
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,150
Bye.

740
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,960
Thank you. Thank you.

741
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

742
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,480
Bye.

743
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,360
What did he say?

744
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,120
What does it mean? What does it mean?

745
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,000
He said that

746
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,760
he likes your works very much.

747
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
When he first saw it,

748
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,360
he wanted to

749
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,680
put it on his porch cabinet.

750
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,560
Yes!

751
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,120
I'll treat you to a hair salon, Ziqiu!

752
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,680
Cheers!

753
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,400
Bottom up!

754
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,970
Don't drink too much. You have work to do this afternoon.

755
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,880
I'm just happy!

756
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,720
I'm very full.

757
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,240
You're so calm!

758
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,480
Right now, when I think of

759
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,600
Two Boys and A Girl

760
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,760
becoming an artwork

761
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,720
that is to be sold all around the world,

762
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,480
and if it goes popular,

763
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,200
we'll make so much money.

764
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,320
It can't be that much. You're just too excited.

765
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
So, you have to work harder.

766
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,010
Participate in more competitions

767
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
to win more awards.

768
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
OK, Miss Goose Killer.

769
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,600
Oh, my golden-egg-laying goose!

770
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,600
This is a great chance.

771
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,840
We should take this chance

772
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,360
to make our studio much well-known.

773
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,960
We can say

774
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,560
"Born in the 1990s,

775
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,320
the vanguard artist

776
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,240
Li Jianjian's copyright of a work

777
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,800
was bought by a Dutch company Maciel

778
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,640
at a high price,

779
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,680
and her works have become popular domestically and internationally.

780
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,340
No. That's too exaggerating.

781
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,650
No, it's not.

782
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,690
I agree with you.

783
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,880
A lot of things

784
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,340
depend on promotions now.

785
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,760
If those vanguard artists hadn't

786
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,560
been promoted,

787
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,760
we wouldn't have known them, right?

788
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,440
Oh, our senior schoolmate,

789
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,340
whose pseudonym is Yufei,

790
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,280
is so amazing.

791
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,960
I think he was a student of sculptures enrolled in 2003.

792
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,000
Now, in France,

793
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,880
he has not only exhibited his own works,

794
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,400
but also become an exhibition planner.

795
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,160
It's said that he's so well-connected

796
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,360
and he has lots of influential friends.

797
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,200
You know what?

798
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,040
Both Yufei

799
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,160
and Li Jianjian

800
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,400
are Mr. Peng Yulin's students.

801
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,480
They learned from

802
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,920
the same master.

803
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,520
And they're so close.

804
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Peng Yulin?

805
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,400
Isn't he our school's

806
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,600
honorary professor?

807
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
He's willing to teach talented students.

808
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,480
It's just

809
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,200
that you're not talented enough.

810
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,600
I read on the newspaper

811
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,080
that one of his works was

812
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,810
auctioned over 4 million yuan.

813
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
See?

814
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,760
Well, how I wish

815
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,440
Mr. Peng were my grandpa!

816
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,960
Miss Li, he's your teacher,

817
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
and you should ask for his help.

818
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,560
Ask him to recommend you

819
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,120
into some artists' circles

820
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,360
so you can know some awesome people,

821
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,040
and your works will

822
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,880
certainly be sold at higher prices.

823
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,680
This world is all about

824
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,440
connections and promotions.

825
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,480
Works are the most important,

826
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,920
instead of other things.

827
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,200
Right now, in this world,

828
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,620
without good connections, you can't get anywhere.

829
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,320
That's for incompetent people.

830
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,380
Our studio relies on our great works.

831
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,120
You're wrong.

832
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,680
It's also a kind of competence

833
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,360
to be well-connected.

834
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,520
I agree with you.

835
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,760
I think

836
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,640
being well-connected

837
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,970
is a kind of competence,

838
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,960
and so is

839
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,080
being lucky.

840
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,040
But

841
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,080
different bosses

842
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,720
have different business philosophies.

843
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,650
It's great that you have this idea.

844
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,560
If you want to make it

845
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,020
by currying favor with influential people ,

846
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,120
you should work

847
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,080
in a studio that

848
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,880
shares this business philosophy,

849
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,320
instead of staying

850
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,240
in this studio.

851
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,680
Right?

852
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Well, that's not what I meant.

853
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,240
I just want

854
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,480
to help our studio.

855
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,320
That's right.

856
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,160
He's not good at expressing himself.

857
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,320
I know. I didn't mean any offence.

858
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,440
Li Jianjian is

859
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
an honest person.

860
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,920
Ever since she took a fancy to wood carvings,

861
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,440
she has never stopped getting injuries on her hands.

862
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,880
And she's got all the long-time calluses on the fingers.

863
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,200
I don't think

864
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,080
you have a sculptor's hands.

865
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,280
I'm saying this for your own good.

866
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,880
After all, your development might be limited

867
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,810
if you stay here.

868
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Ziqiu, here, have some meat.

869
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,360
Thank you for the help.

870
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,960
Thank you.

871
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,730
OK. Thank you very much.

872
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,880
Jianjian,

873
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,080
don't you have to register your copyright

874
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,960
this afternoon?

875
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
You said it's necessary for the contract.

876
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,770
I know. I remember that.

877
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,600
You guys go back.

878
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
I'll see Ziqiu off.

879
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,320
We'll go to your shop next time.

880
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
OK. I'll buy you a cup of coffee then.

881
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,680
OK. Bye.

882
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,480
Bye.

883
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,480
Why does she want to be someone like that?

884
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,360
She always

885
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,000
dates scums.

886
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,640
No one warned her before?

887
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
She tends to lose her wit when in love,

888
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,200
like a wild and unbridled horse.

889
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,520
No one can stop her.

890
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,160
But except for that,

891
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,690
she's really a good person.

892
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,880
I don't think

893
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,040
this relationship will last for a few months.

894
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,520
Don't mind it. Just let her do whatever she wants.

895
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,320
Let's go then.

896
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,480
Today, you did a really great job!
