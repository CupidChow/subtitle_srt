1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,940
Episode 39

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't feed them so much. They'll over-eat.

5
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
You don't avoid him anymore?

6
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,810
You even caught up with him.

7
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Don't talk nonsense.

8
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,760
I just apologized to him.

9
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
He just told me that

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,640
he loved me back then.

11
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
I made such a scene.

12
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,540
Now you've realized you made a scene?

13
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,090
What's this for?

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
You covet my beauty?

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,840
Congratulations, actress,

16
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,640
on your success in the audition.

17
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Well,

18
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm so talented

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,160
that even the good heavens wanted me to be an actress.

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Then you have to quit the current job as soon as you can.

21
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,340
I already have.

22
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll go home tomorrow

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
and tell my parents about this.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm full of energy now.

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
I can fight against my mother

26
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,120
for another century.

27
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,080
Alright.

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,440
Stop talking about fighting every day.

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,080
It hasn't done you any good so far.

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,210
Have a calm and rational talk with her.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,200
OK.

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,120
Ms. Jin.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Mom.

34
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
Mingyue, I'm going to take a shower.

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
OK.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,740
Your mother is staying here tonight?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,560
My dad went home to pack up today.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,600
My mother didn't want to stay at home.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,320
So I brought her here.

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
Your dad went home to pack up?

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,020
What happened?

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,620
They got divorced.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,260
Wasn't it just a fight?

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,360
Mingyue,

45
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
do you hate me too?

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,080
Sometimes.

47
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Do you hate me as well?

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
You're my life.

49
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
It's hot. Don't hug me.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just want to.

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,530
I'm your little cotton padded jacket.

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
You are a little cotton padded jacket in summer

53
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,760
and a little popsicle in winter.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Mom,

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,160
you'll have me in the future.

56
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
You're also my life.

57
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Coming.

58
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,680
Chengzi?

59
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,600
Mingyue,

60
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,480
this is a gift from my mother.

61
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,360
Thank you.

62
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,520
We will

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,000
drop by your place this evening.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,720
Is it OK?

65
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
OK, I'll tell her.

66
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,760
You slept there last night?

67
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,320
No!

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
Yeah.

69
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,000
But it's not like

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,860
what you think.

71
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,080
Seriously!

72
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,200
You kid, don't let your imagination run wild.

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,760
Don't tell your mother

74
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,960
when you go back home.

75
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,080
I really just

76
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,280
had a chat with your older brother.

77
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,240
Didn't you notice that

78
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,960
your older brother's state of mind

79
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,120
is much better?

80
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,159
So, that's all because

81
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,560
you talked to him?

82
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,360
Yes, he can fall asleep much easier now.

83
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,159
Then you can talk with him

84
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,280
any way you like.

85
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,400
We really just

86
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,360
had a chat.

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
I beg your pardon?

88
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,400
Say that again!

89
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,520
Ziqiu.

90
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
Come in and talk to me.

91
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,010
Explain what you mean by "just a chat."

92
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,040
Take this one as well.

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,560
Thank you.

94
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
I've got to go.

95
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,680
OK.

96
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:18,960
Bye.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,480
Bye.

98
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,200
Just a chat.

99
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,490
It's so hot. Why don't you wait inside?

100
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,690
It's not so hot. I just got here.

101
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Let's go inside. It's hot.

102
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,980
You just said it's not hot.

103
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,160
These are all foods.

104
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,360
I mean books on cooking.

105
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,760
Yeah.

106
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,650
In fact, you can learn to make soup.

107
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
It's easy.

108
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
And Ziqiu likes soup.

109
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,810
What does Li Jianjian like?

110
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
She likes sweet food.

111
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,440
She likes sour and sweet dishes.

112
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,380
What about you?

113
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Me? I'm not picky.

114
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,880
I can eat anything.

115
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
Then, please give my dishes

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
a try when I finish cooking.

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
OK, no problem.

118
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,280
Happy families are similar.

119
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,520
Unhappy families are different.

120
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,960
That's the first sentence here.

121
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

122
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
This is the first sentence

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,840
at the beginning of the book.

124
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,280
When I was young,

125
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,520
I felt the same way,

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,760
thinking that

127
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,220
I was the unfortunate one.

128
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Now I'm old,

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,800
and I see I was so wrong

130
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,240
and had such a bad judgment about men.

131
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,360
You're not old. You're still young.

132
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,000
I am old. I have gray hairs already.

133
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
You still look good with gray hairs.

134
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,560
Your previous relationship with the teacher

135
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,090
has indeed influenced you.

136
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,440
You began to like reading famous works.

137
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
I really didn't

138
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
have a relationship with Ms. Zhang.

139
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,060
Seriously!

140
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,160
We are just friends.

141
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,400
I picked this book because you said that

142
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,560
you like reading famous works.

143
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,840
So I picked this book

144
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,280
and flipped through the pages.

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,960
I didn't expect you

146
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,080
to read out the first sentence.

147
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,560
I don't understand much.

148
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,080
It is full of words.

149
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,560
And my eyesight isn't very good.

150
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,890
And the book is so thick.

151
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,440
It's OK.

152
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,690
You were teasing me?

153
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,360
I just...

154
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,970
I thought you were serious.

155
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,560
Now I realize

156
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,040
my judgment about men in the past

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,880
was bad.

158
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,360
A serious man is better.

159
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,600
That scared me.

160
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,890
Let's go.

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
What are you doing?

162
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,640
We should know when to stop!

163
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,360
What an embarrassment it'll be

164
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,480
to be caught by them!

165
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,320
Are you stupid?

166
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,640
We can say it's just an encounter.

167
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,300
Encounter?

168
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,800
It's embarrassing to

169
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,920
encounter your parents on their date!

170
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,000
What's more, their flirting

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
is really disgusting!

172
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,880
Disgusting?

173
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,160
That's a sweet thing.

174
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,120
I don't feel that way.

175
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,920
Let's just go.

176
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,640
No. I want to take a look.

177
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
Don't you need to go to the studio?

178
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
I don't want to.

179
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,720
It's so depressing there.

180
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,450
Don't worry.

181
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
I will go to the hospital this afternoon

182
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,080
to visit Zhao Huaguang's father.

183
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,640
I'm sure

184
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,120
I'll get the picture for you.

185
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,360
Just go to the studio.

186
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,620
But I want to see them on a date.

187
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,480
No!

188
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,880
Let go of me.

189
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
Stop messing around.

190
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,560
Sorry. Sorry.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Dad.

192
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,520
You're here too.

193
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,160
What a coincidence!

194
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,530
What a coincidence!

195
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,480
It's destiny.

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,330
It's a little undercooked.

197
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,640
It would be better if it was cooked

198
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,480
for another half an hour.

199
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,740
It was your mom.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,280
She wanted to buy

201
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,160
a cooking book.

202
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,090
I happened to have free time today.

203
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,100
So I went with her to the bookshop.

204
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,680
OK.

205
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,880
What?

206
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,520
Say something.

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,730
I don't know what to talk about.

208
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,880
Aunt

209
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
we didn't actually think

210
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,960
you were on a date.

211
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,520
We just...

212
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,920
We are actually on a date.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
What's your opinion?

214
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
Please…

215
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Let's eat. Let's eat.

216
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,840
Thank you.

217
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,720
Eat!

218
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,740
Seriously, Ling Xiao.

219
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,920
Ziqiu and I caught them on a date.

220
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,680
Then we ate together.

221
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,980
In the end, Ms. He Mei admitted it.

222
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,240
OK, OK!

223
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,880
I'll tell you all the details when I'm back home.

224
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,080
I’ll hang up now. Bye.

225
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
What's the big deal?

226
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,400
They just took a walk in the bookshop.

227
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,840
That wasn't a walk in the bookshop.

228
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
It was a date.

229
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,380
You're not happy with our dad dating?

230
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,040
Once they get married,

231
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,000
we'll be really connected.

232
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm not as excited about it as you are.

233
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't care.

234
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm used to it anyway.

235
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,400
But I care.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,040
I'd been really worried about

237
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,840
his lifetime happiness.

238
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,120
He didn't like anyone

239
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,580
who was introduced to him.

240
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
He's in his 50s.

241
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,640
If he doesn't find

242
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,320
someone to marry with now,

243
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,780
a couple of decades later,

244
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,720
he'll have to do it on the other side.

245
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,840
What are you talking about?

246
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,560
Shut up!

247
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,240
Where are you going now?

248
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,900
Going home?

249
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,840
I'm going to the studio.

250
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,040
You said you didn't want to go to the studio.

251
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,880
Now I feel like

252
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,610
I can overcome any difficulty.

253
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,960
Isn't it just slander?

254
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,180
It's not a big deal.

255
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,240
I'll go now. Call me if there's anything.

256
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,960
OK. See you later.

257
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,680
Bye bye.

258
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,240
Juan.

259
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,560
I told you.

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
I needed time to think.

261
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,050
Why did you keep calling me?

262
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,300
I was not in the mood

263
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,160
to do anything else

264
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,420
without you by my side.

265
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,560
Have you decided yet?

266
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,880
I called Jianjian.

267
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,280
She will be here any minute.

268
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,480
Let's talk to each other face-to-face.

269
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,400
Juan,

270
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,300
it must have been hard for you, right?

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,500
Your eyes are puffy after crying.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
You're so kind-hearted.

273
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
It must have been hard for you

274
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
to make such a choice, right?

275
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,440
Don't worry.

276
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
No matter what happens in the future,

277
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
I will be there for you.

278
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,940
Get me some water, please.

279
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,240
OK. I'll make you a cup of coffee.

280
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,810
Good afternoon.

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Have you had lunch?

282
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,880
I came here after lunch.

283
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,160
No appetite.

284
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,100
Take a seat.

285
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,500
Zhou Miao, bring a chair here.

286
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,490
Have you found the picture?

287
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,480
Can you find it?

288
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,960
Maybe.

289
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Zhou Miao, what do you think?

290
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,200
In my opinion,

291
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,460
plagiarizing once

292
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
isn't so serious.

293
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,120
Just don't do it again.

294
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,360
Miss Li is so talented.

295
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,960
She will certainly

296
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,890
create better works in the future.

297
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,930
I personally think that

298
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Juan shouldn't be

299
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
involved in this matter.

300
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
You're responsible for the contract violation.

301
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,720
And you should

302
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,360
take sole responsibility for this.

303
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
Don't involve other people.

304
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,260
That's my opinion.

305
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,400
You called me to come back in such a hurry

306
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,060
just to have me listen to this?

307
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,000
I need you

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,160
to listen to it

309
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,920
in person.

310
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,760
OK.

311
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,970
Go ahead.

312
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
After a night's reflection,

313
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
I now officially inform you:

314
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,000
Zhou Miao, you are fired.

315
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,280
What?

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Are you kidding me?

317
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
And I officially inform you:

318
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm breaking up with you.

319
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,840
You don't have to return

320
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,970
anything I gave you.

321
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,360
Please pack up your things

322
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
and get out of here right now!

323
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,840
I don't want to see you again.

324
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
And please shut your filthy mouth up!

325
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,200
Don't say another word

326
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
to slander Li Jianjian again.

327
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
Are you crazy?

328
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,760
I did this for your own good.

329
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
How can you be so ungrateful?

330
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,890
And you even wanted to break up with me?

331
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,770
You're lazy, you're sly, and you squander money.

332
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,280
You told me a university society was hosting an event.

333
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,040
But it turned out

334
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,800
you stayed up all night playing games.

335
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,600
Fine. I could forgive you.

336
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
Because I loved you.

337
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,120
But you really think

338
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,440
I'm a fool?

339
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,220
Now Li Jianjian is in trouble,

340
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,840
you even told me to stay out of it by stopping working with her.

341
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,300
What can I expect from you?

342
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,880
People like you run faster

343
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,920
than anyone else when in trouble.

344
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,160
I won't do it again.

345
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
I knew Li Jianjian has been

346
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,330
putting up with you.

347
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,400
Because I loved you,

348
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,480
she was willing to put up with you

349
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
for the sake of me.

350
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,520
You can do anything to me,

351
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,160
but you just can't slander her.

352
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,960
I do not allow you to slander her!

353
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,520
I didn't mean to slander Miss Li.

354
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
That's what

355
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,730
all the posts on the internet said.

356
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,120
I've realized I was wrong now.

357
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,680
I'll apologize to her.

358
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
OK?

359
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,520
No, thanks.

360
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,330
You have one minute.

361
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,440
Get out!

362
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,760
Don't be so heartless.

363
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,040
You have 30 seconds left.

364
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,290
I've worked 16 days this month.

365
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,040
You still owe me

366
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,280
half a month's salary.

367
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,880
And

368
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,930
return the necklace I gave you.

369
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,600
Get out!

370
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,720
Well, every time you fell in love,

371
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,160
you were always the one who wanted to break up first.

372
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,420
And you'd be the one who cried every time.

373
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,720
I loved him so much.

374
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,120
But he's just scum.

375
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,000
Now he has returned

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,240
to where he belongs.

377
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,640
Alright.

378
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
You should be happy. Why cry?

379
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,690
Don't worry.

380
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,600
I have a hunch.

381
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,400
For the next relationship,

382
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,860
you will find it in a garden

383
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,560
instead of a garbage can.

384
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,960
There'll be no next relationship.

385
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,480
What next relationship?

386
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,940
I don't want to be in a relationship anymore.

387
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,440
That's what you said last time.

388
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Who is he?

389
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,690
I don't know.

390
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,080
Is he that lad?

391
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,360
Exactly.

392
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,160
I guess

393
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
he's that lad.

394
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,860
That’s him?

395
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,210
He's the son of that wife of his.

396
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,120
He's such a big boy already.

397
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,480
Yeah. I haven't seen him before.

398
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,600
No one knows for sure.

399
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,530
We never saw him when he was little.

400
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,200
Who is he?

401
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,040
Isn't he...

402
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Yes, he is.

403
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,280
Is that him?

404
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,960
I don't know.

405
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,360
Yes, that's him.

406
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,360
Well, I...

407
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm going outside.

408
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Keep an eye on him.

409
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
OK, OK.

410
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,720
Let's go.

411
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,010
Smoking is not allowed inside.

412
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,530
And it's not good for your health, either.

413
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,970
The money you sent me before

414
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,280
is on this card.

415
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,340
The password is the first six digits of the card number.

416
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,010
Take it back.

417
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,120
It's for you. Keep it.

418
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,380
I don't want it.

419
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,740
My father always taught me

420
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,530
not to take other people's things.

421
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,160
Have you got the picture I want?

422
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,560
Do you always feel that

423
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,360
I abandoned you?

424
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,500
Not really.

425
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,120
After all, it's normal for you to treat me that way.

426
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,770
There's no bond between us.

427
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
No bond?

428
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
I'm your real father.

429
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,460
You think there's no bond between us?

430
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,300
You're my biological father.

431
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,850
But you never raised me.

432
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,200
You didn't meet me

433
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
until I turned 18.

434
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,780
It's not realistic to say that

435
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,760
we have a bond.

436
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Maybe I was just a tool for you

437
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,450
to carry on the family lineage.

438
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,650
Since I didn't take your last name,

439
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
you abandoned me.

440
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,040
Ziqiu,

441
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,040
it's you who never accepted me.

442
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,080
It's you who treated me as a non-family member.

443
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,040
You never wanted to accept your real family.

444
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,480
Did you know?

445
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,720
When I was a kid,

446
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,240
your grandfather was

447
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,810
very strict with me.

448
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,810
At home, if I dared to argue with him even once,

449
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,200
he'd tie me to the beam to beat me up.

450
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,520
A father is responsible

451
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,080
for disciplining his son.

452
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,640
And a son must

453
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,690
take care of his father.

454
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,900
The Chinese tradition is that

455
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,160
if you spare the rod, you spoil the child.

456
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,840
Ziqiu,

457
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,880
I never beat you, right?

458
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,640
Forget it. We have different ways of thinking.

459
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,200
We can't talk.

460
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,660
It doesn't make sense.

461
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
Why can't we be close?

462
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,160
Because you're always trading with me.

463
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,160
You paid me

464
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
to take your family name.

465
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,560
When I asked you to help me find the picture,

466
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,620
you told me to come and visit grandpa.

467
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,480
We have totally opposing values

468
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,810
and a lot of resentment,

469
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,440
and we can't even establish

470
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,640
the most basic trust.

471
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,410
We are always on guard against each other.

472
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,400
Ziqiu,

473
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,820
in fact, I just want you to be an obedient son.

474
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,800
My father never asked me to be obedient.

475
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,480
But this time,

476
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,400
I've seen

477
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,530
another side of you.

478
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,020
You are a very good son,

479
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,820
who is very competent.

480
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
You indeed made a lot of effort

481
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,330
and made grandpa proud.

482
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,640
Otherwise, while he's ill now,

483
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,520
there would not be so many people willing

484
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,050
to come and take care of him.

485
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
I even felt, for the first time, that

486
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,810
you being my biological father

487
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,720
isn't that bad.

488
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
I hope grandpa will

489
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,080
recover soon.

490
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,760
According to the agreement,

491
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,440
you help me find the picture,

492
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
and I will visit him when I have time.

493
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,620
If there's nothing else, I should go now.

494
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,960
About my picture...

495
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,800
Well, try to find it as soon as you can.

496
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,640
Take care.

497
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,380
Never mind.

498
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,740
We don't have to see each other again.

499
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,380
All have been settled now.

500
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,920
Zheng Shuran,

501
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,820
I've sent you the picture.

502
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,570
We're depending on you now.

503
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,600
Dramas?

504
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah.

505
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,640
The original actress

506
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,280
had an accident

507
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
and broke her leg,

508
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,560
so I had a chance to take her role.

509
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,640
Mom, dad,

510
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,920
I really have

511
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,120
tried hard to work there

512
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,160
recently,

513
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
but I feel that

514
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
I have no energy every day,

515
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,220
and it's very boring all the time.

516
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,210
But now that I can be an actress,

517
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm completely

518
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,560
full of energy.

519
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,400
I feel alive again.

520
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,720
I really, really

521
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
like acting.

522
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,600
Good, good!

523
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,000
Well...

524
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
Why are you still like this?

525
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,600
How many days have you spent there working?

526
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,040
I thought you have

527
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,960
stopped being unrealistic.

528
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,440
I've done nothing wrong in wanting to be an actress.

529
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,160
And I won't change my mind.

530
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,660
I didn't have a chance in the past.

531
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,240
Now I have.

532
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,400
Although it doesn't pay as much,

533
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,200
and life will be a little harder,

534
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,360
it doesn't matter.

535
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,010
Haven't you two told me?

536
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,400
We have our own car

537
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
and house.

538
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
And you don't expect me

539
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,880
to earn a lot of money for the family.

540
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,540
Yes, right.

541
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Right?

542
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,720
OK.

543
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,080
We don't expect you

544
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,610
to earn a lot for the family.

545
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,600
But next year,

546
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,800
you will be 27 years old.

547
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
How can you still live in your dream?

548
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640
I asked a fortune teller.

549
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,880
He said you'd have no luck

550
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,120
to become a popular superstar.

551
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,320
But if you get married

552
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
before the age

553
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,040
of 28,

554
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,800
it will be good for your marriage.

555
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,680
You went to see a fortune teller again?

556
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
I told you not to do that.

557
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,860
That is superstition!

558
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,080
I did this for her, OK?

559
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,240
Mom,

560
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
did the fortune teller tell you

561
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
why I didn't have the luck to be a star?

562
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,880
It's not in your destiny.

563
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,360
Back in your senior high schooldays,

564
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,960
when Director Zhou was choosing the female protagonist,

565
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,520
everyone thought that

566
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,400
you had 50% chance to be chosen.

567
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,040
But

568
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,640
he picked someone who was not as good as you.

569
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,800
It just proved that you're destined to fail.

570
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,920
She wasn't not as good as me.

571
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,800
And I wasn't not as good as her, either.

572
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,760
It's just that the director thought

573
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,800
she's more suitable for that role than I was.

574
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,360
Yeah.

575
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,880
More suitable?

576
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
If it makes you feel comfortable

577
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,680
thinking that way,

578
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
then so be it.

579
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,330
When I failed the audition,

580
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
an agency

581
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,760
offered to work with me?

582
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,690
What did you say?

583
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,560
You said you could also get me dramas to play,

584
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
promote me,

585
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,760
and help me look good,

586
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
so there's no need to pay others to do it.

587
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,480
Then what happened?

588
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,400
That agency

589
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
developed into a successful business!

590
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
All the actors and actresses who signed contracts with them

591
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,360
are well known now.

592
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,240
Well, back then,

593
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,200
how...

594
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,520
could I have realized

595
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,160
what an agency was, right?

596
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,280
Right. She couldn't have.

597
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,520
Back in my senior high school days,

598
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,320
when I wanted to take part in the entry examination for the Central Academy of Drama and Beijing Film Academy,

599
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,720
you solicited a drama for me.

600
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,800
You said that it was written by some famous director and screenwriter,

601
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,080
and I would definitely become popular.

602
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,440
You said getting in an academy was to get popular.

603
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,000
Of all those people they auditioned,

604
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,400
not many of them could be popular.

605
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,130
You told me to seize the chance.

606
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,000
But for that drama,

607
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,160
I missed the art exam

608
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,700
and went to a third class university.

609
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,040
In the end,

610
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,640
that drama was not even aired.

611
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,100
Well...

612
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,600
Yeah.

613
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,400
So this shows you that

614
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,530
you're not destined to be popular.

615
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,440
I also used to think that

616
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,160
acting was for becoming popular.

617
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,360
But now that I'm an adult,

618
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,440
I've finally realized that

619
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,400
I just want to be an actress.

620
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,560
Bluntly speaking,

621
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,120
as you didn't graduate from junior high school,

622
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,880
and I got distracted from school because of acting,

623
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,720
we both suffered from

624
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,980
the lack of education.

625
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,640
So now,

626
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
you're determined to be an actress?

627
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,200
I'm determined to be an actress.

628
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,760
You...

629
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
Please! Enough!

630
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,120
It wasn't easy for her

631
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,600
to go back on the right track.

632
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
I think this is the right track as well.

633
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,440
Can, I decide to support you.

634
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,360
If you want to act, do it well.

635
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,360
Don't listen to the fortune teller.

636
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,620
That is superstition.

637
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,240
But you have to understand your mother.

638
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,640
Our relatives

639
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,680
said something bad behind our back.

640
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,660
Your mother just doesn't like their gossip.

641
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,130
I don't agree with this.

642
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,880
It doesn't matter whether you agree or not.

643
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,640
I hope

644
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,240
every time I see my daughter,

645
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,010
she'll be as happy as she was

646
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,560
in her childhood.

647
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,880
You...

648
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm sorry, dad.

649
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,360
I've made mom angry again.

650
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,540
I'll talk to her when we get back home.

651
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,600
You have tight rehearsal schedules.

652
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,860
Take care of yourself.

653
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,320
When I have free time,

654
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,180
I'll make soup and bring it to you.

655
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,280
Come on! What are you doing?

656
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,050
I'm putting on my shoes.

657
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,280
I've got to go.

658
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,400
But today,

659
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,920
the things you said

660
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,650
have bothered her all the time.

661
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,720
Don't talk about them again in the future.

662
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
When we get back home,

663
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,320
she'll be sad for quite a few days.

664
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,450
I didn't mean to mention those things.

665
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,080
OK.

666
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,080
Focus on your dramas.

667
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,530
Go for it!

668
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,280
I will!

669
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,440
Bye.

670
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,520
I can do it!

671
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,680
I have a hunch that

672
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,320
some beautiful girls will invite me to dinner tonight.

673
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,520
We're not in the mood.

674
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,480
Neither of you read the forum?

675
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,200
What's there to read?

676
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,920
The whole world is slandering us.

677
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,640
You didn't check your phones either?

678
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,960
Those schoolmates just keep

679
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,600
questioning us.

680
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,880
They don't even listen to our explanation.

681
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,960
Most of them probably just want to have fun.

682
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,560
Maybe you should have a look.

683
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,630
I spent a whole night

684
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,560
digging for his dirty history.

685
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,520
If you don't,

686
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,929
my work would be in vain.

687
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
My goodness!

688
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,630
Yufei is a habitual plagiarist!

689
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,710
On the internet,

690
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,630
he has long been suspected of plagiarism.

691
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,280
Due to plagiarism,

692
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,440
he was forced by some foreign niche artists

693
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,190
to sign compensation agreements in private.

694
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,760
Few people

695
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,880
really know him abroad.

696
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,800
I spent two days

697
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,440
looking for his dirty history.

698
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,190
Zheng Shuran, you've saved us.

699
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,600
You're the real keyboard warrior!

700
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,670
Are you sure that's a compliment?

701
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,440
What made you want to

702
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,970
dig into his dirty history?

703
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,330
He obviously copied your idea.

704
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,480
Plagiarism is

705
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,720
not occasional.

706
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,800
If he plagiarized your work,

707
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
he could certainly copy others.

708
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,640
But

709
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,760
just because he's dirty doesn't mean I'm clean.

710
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,400
Can you be patient?

711
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,800
Keep reading.

712
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,620
The picture behind "Two Boys and A Girl"!

713
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,440
Ziqiu found the picture!

714
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,520
As soon as he got it,

715
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
he sent it to me.

716
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
Like you said,

717
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,200
just because Yufei's dirty doesn't mean you're clean.

718
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,800
But I was determined to show that you're clean!

719
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,360
Thank you so much!

720
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,610
You're a legend!

721
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Don't mention it.

722
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,200
Oh my goodness!

723
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,020
My tears are bursting out.

724
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,000
She doesn't need

725
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,130
to be this grateful!

726
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,700
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

727
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,840
About Mr. Li and Ms. He Mei,

728
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,800
let's talk about it when I get home.

729
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,280
I still have some appointments

730
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
with my patients.

731
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,100
You're inviting Zheng Shuran to dinner?

732
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,960
That's the right thing to do.

733
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,000
Have fun.

734
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,920
My mom invited me to her house warming meal tonight.

735
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Don't worry. I won't argue with her.

736
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,280
Talk to you later.

737
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
My colleague is here.

738
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,810
See you at home tonight.

739
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:11,880
Bye.

740
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,250
Is being in a relationship so good?

741
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,160
I've been single for too long,

742
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,600
and I'm withering.

743
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,520
I want a man, too.

744
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,780
Isn't Dr. Song wooing you?

745
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,770
He's three years older than me.

746
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,500
I prefer younger guys.

747
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,900
I'll stop teasing you.

748
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,920
Can you finish work at regular time today?

749
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,580
How much longer should I wait?

750
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,840
Why would you wait for me?

751
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,640
Your mother invited me

752
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,100
to her house warming meal.

753
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,610
Didn't she tell you?

754
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,040
After dinner,

755
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,840
let's cook

756
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,440
some of these rose-petal-filled dumplings,

757
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,920
OK?

758
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,380
It's the brand Sinian Huaxianzi, right?

759
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,370
It's pretty delicious.

760
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,840
Let's buy some fruits as well.

761
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,560
There seems to be no fruit left.

762
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,690
Go buy some from the fruit shop nearby.

763
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,680
I'll text my older brother

764
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,760
and ask him to buy some fruit

765
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,800
he likes.

766
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,450
That's not such a good idea.

767
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
We don't want to be inhospitable, do we?

768
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,960
Mom, for the house warming meal,

769
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,680
instead of inviting Li Jianjian and Ziqiu,

770
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,880
you invited his female colleague

771
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,560
to come.

772
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,600
What are you up to?

773
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
What's wrong with

774
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,880
inviting your older brother's female colleague?

775
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,640
In fact, I don't think

776
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,840
Li Jianjian is such a bad person.

777
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,000
She is very nice.

778
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,960
And she's really nice

779
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,090
to my older brother.

780
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,120
By the way, buy a watermelon.

781
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,920
Ling Xiao likes watermelon.

782
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,720
And feel free to buy some other fruits.

783
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,480
Mom, what you're doing will upset Ling Xiao.

784
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,760
There'll be a fight again.

785
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't you want him to be happy?

786
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,040
Buy some drinks, too.

787
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
You like Coke, right?

788
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,650
Buy yourself some Coke.

789
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,760
Let Ling Xiao

790
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,880
live his life the way he wants.

791
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
Mom, stop pushing him, please!

792
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,920
Are you done talking?

793
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Will you go food shopping?

794
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,180
If you don't want to go, I'll do it myself.

795
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,240
I'll go now.

796
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,040
I'll be back soon.

797
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,000
Make it quick.

798
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,520
Ling Xiao?

799
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,220
You've finished work?

800
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
Dr. Feng?

801
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,680
I cleaned your teeth once.

802
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,720
Your name is...

803
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,020
Qi Mingyue.

804
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,240
Yes, Qi Mingyue!

805
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,100
Nice to see you.

806
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,000
Hi.

807
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,120
My mom invited Miss Feng

808
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,280
to have dinner at home.

809
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,480
A house warming meal.

810
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,040
OK. You guys go ahead.

811
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,760
I'm going to buy some stuff at a convenient store.

812
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,160
Bye.

813
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,720
Bye.

814
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,320
Coming.

815
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,600
Ling Xiao.

816
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,040
Hi, Chengzi.

817
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,000
Remember me?

818
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,640
I'm your brother's colleague.

819
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,040
Yes, Dr. Feng.

820
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,200
Come on in.

821
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,600
Come on in.

822
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,600
No need to change your shoes.

823
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,480
Hi, Ms. Chen.

824
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
I don't know what flowers you like.

825
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,840
So I just picked some randomly.

826
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,570
Lily is good.

827
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
It implies something nice (Good match for a century).

828
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,040
I'll put it here.

829
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,760
OK, OK.

830
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,600
No need to change shoes.

831
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,680
Come on in.

832
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,060
You ran into a traffic jam?

833
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,960
I guess the traffic is busy now.

834
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Here, take a seat.

835
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,520
The dishes are getting cold.

836
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,640
I don't know what you like.

837
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,560
So I prepared some homemade dishes.

838
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,720
I usually order takeaways

839
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,560
at work.

840
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,420
So homemade dishes are very good!

841
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,100
Great! Make yourself at home.

842
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,880
Have you had these before?

843
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,680
I wanted them to be an after-dinner dessert.

844
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,400
But Chengzi

845
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,040
insisted that you try

846
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,560
these rose-petal-filled dumplings now.

847
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
You tried these before?

848
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,400
I know these.

849
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,320
These are rose-petal-filled dumplings of the brand Sinian.

850
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
The wrap is made from lotus root starch.

851
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,600
There really are rose petals in the fillings.

852
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,160
And they even give out a rose scent when boiled.

853
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
And they're delicious.

854
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I bought a lot

855
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,080
and put them in my fridge, too.

856
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,400
What a coincidence!

857
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,840
So, let's eat.

858
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,800
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

859
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,730
You're welcome.

860
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,800
No one else is invited?

861
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,680
You invited just me?

862
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,800
Among his colleagues,

863
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,240
I'm only familiar with you,

864
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,370
and we tend to have good time together.

865
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,480
Here.

866
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,200
Come on. Let's eat.

867
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,380
Is Li Jianjian not coming either?

868
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,200
She is eating out tonight with her friends.

869
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,560
Don't wait. Let's eat.

870
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,040
Well, may I

871
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,160
use your washroom?

872
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,730
It's over there.

873
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
That door over there.

874
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,400
OK.

875
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:48,880
OK.

876
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,090
What's the matter with you?

877
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,130
You've put on this grumpy face as soon as you got back.

878
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,520
I just like chatting with her

879
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,120
and enjoy being with her,

880
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,160
so I invited her

881
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,400
to have a meal at home.

882
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,690
You don't have to explain to me.

883
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,640
You can do whatever you want.

884
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,880
But whatever you do

885
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,280
has nothing to do with me.

886
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,120
You won't like

887
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,320
whatever I do anyway,

888
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,080
because your heart is with someone else's family.

889
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,410
Think however you want,

890
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,040
as long as

891
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000
you don't arrange such boring events again.

892
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,130
I have a girlfriend.

893
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,720
But I don't like her.

894
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,460
I didn’t force you to like her.

895
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,640
I tried.

896
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,240
But I really couldn't.

897
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,620
Anyone will do.

898
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,320
Anyone except for her!

899
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,520
I just can't accept her.

900
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,840
You don't have to accept her.

901
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,920
I hate her.

902
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,960
What happened to Ling Xiao?

903
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,200
Nothing.

904
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,440
He suddenly got something to attend to.
