00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,860
Episode 13

4
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,880
I want to go to the toilet.

5
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,000
Let' go.

6
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,640
I can go by myself.

7
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,340
It's fine for me to go with you.

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,040
No need.

9
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
We shouldn't go to

10
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,160
the toilet together at this age.

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
You're occupied, right?

12
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,880
In fact…

13
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
I'm fine.

14
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,410
Li Jianjian,

15
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
come to Room No. 5.

16
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,280
Go.

17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,240
Coming.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,450
You want to run away.

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,560
Come back.

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,720
Qi Mingyue, let me go.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm not going. I'm not.

22
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,360
Hurry up.

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,720
Don't force me.

24
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Go in.

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Sorry, doctor.

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Come and lie down.

27
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,360
Turn around and open your mouth.

28
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,740
In fact, it doesn't hurt much.

29
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,770
Open your mouth.

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,160
It hurts.

31
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,800
There are two decayed teeth.

32
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,960
The one with a bigger cavity

33
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
has exposed the dental nerve.

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
Now food impaction

35
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,240
caused inflammation.

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
First, clean it and eliminate inflammation.

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,040
You should receive root canal therapy

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,400
after the inflammation is eliminated.

39
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,130
Don't worry.

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
I'll be very careful.

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,250
Take it easy.

42
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,480
Look. Is the light over your head

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
like a rabbit hole?

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,070
Alice went to

45
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,870
another world

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,480
going through that bright hole.

47
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,720
OK.

48
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
Don't eat too hot and

49
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
spicy food later.

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
By the way, eat fewer desserts.

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Clean your teeth carefully.

52
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
I prescribed mouthwash for you.

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Come back when the inflammation is eliminated.

54
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Thank you, doctor.

55
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,010
Li Jianjian.

56
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,760
What?

57
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,880
♫You’re, you’re♫

58
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,120
♫You are everything in my life♫

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,680
You can't even

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,400
recognize my voice.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,720
♫You’re, you’re♫

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,560
♫Never let go♫

63
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,120
♫You help me up when I fall down♫

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
I, I can do it by myself.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
Thanks.

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,960
You're still afraid of visiting a dentist,

67
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,159
though you've grown up.

68
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,120
I won't leave.

69
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,730
I'll always be with you.

70
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,120
Mingyue should have told me

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,680
it was you,

72
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,280
so I would have taken it easy.

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,220
I asked her not to tell you.

74
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,160
Unexpectedly, you couldn't recognize me.

75
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,290
Have I changed a lot?

76
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,600
No.

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
I was too nervous.

78
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,570
I didn't expect that it was you.

79
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,920
You look cool in doctor's overall.

80
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,040
Thank you.

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
You are more and more beautiful.

82
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
Come on.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,920
I was

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,640
thought to be a kid.

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,240
I had to show my ID card

86
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,720
when I went to bars.

87
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,240
I think you're

88
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,490
the most beautiful.

89
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,920
Thanks.

90
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,080
Thank you.

91
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,320
By the way,

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
as you came back,

93
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,580
your dad is very happy, right?

94
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Yes.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,320
You didn't tell my dad that

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,850
Ziqiu has come back, right?

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,400
No.

98
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
He wants to surprise him, right?

99
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,180
I wonder what he is going to do.

100
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,500
He always thinks too much.

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,370
Go about your business.

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,920
Don't, don't delay your work.

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Don't worry. I get no appointment

104
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
as I just began to work here.

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,860
It doesn't matter.

106
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,840
Well.

107
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,880
It's late.

108
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,210
I'm going to the studio.

109
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
It's almost noon.

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,380
Why not have dinner together?

111
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,040
No.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm not very well.

113
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
I can't have things.

114
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Contact with me on WeChat.

115
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,140
Ling Xiao, contact with me on WeChat.

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,770
I visit you personally.

117
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
Are you moved?

118
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,540
Don't bother visiting me.

119
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm here to see

121
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,890
your working environment.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What do you think?

123
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,840
Usmile.

124
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,540
Nice environment.

125
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
It's really

126
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,680
a high-end private dental hospital.

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
It even launched own-brand

128
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,820
electric toothbrush.

129
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,020
Do you earn a lot

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
working here?

131
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,880
Not bad.

132
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,760
Isn't income a privacy matter abroad?

133
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,320
Yes,

134
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,970
but we are brothers.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,600
By the way,

136
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,320
Li Jianjian messaged you again

137
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
after going back yesterday, right?

138
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,960
You're not anxious at all.

139
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,880
Li Jianjian acted

140
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,480
as if nothing had happened

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
after she saw us coming back.

142
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,900
What should she do?

143
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,960
Ask you to

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,240
take her to a cybercafé?

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
The key is

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,580
she didn't look happy.

147
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,960
What is the surprise you're preparing?

148
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
Why don't you go home?

149
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's talk about it later.

150
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,530
You'll know by the time.

151
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,090
You dare not go back, right?

152
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,040
You must be joking.

153
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I'll go back,

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,560
but I'm busy doing business, OK?

155
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,970
Did your dad give you money?

156
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,560
Li Haichao, but not

157
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,210
Li Hai chao is my dad.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
You get what you need

159
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,480
from Zhao Huaguang,

160
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
but you never accept him.

161
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
Anyway, Zhao Huaguang

162
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,040
can't control me now.

163
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,370
I can do whatever I like.

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm not going to

165
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,200
leave this time.

166
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,240
I'll be filial to my dad

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,380
and going to take care of Li Jianjian.

168
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,240
How so?

169
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,760
Just like before.

170
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,490
It's almost nine years.

171
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,080
She isn't a little girl anymore.

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,240
Everything has changed.

173
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,970
Even so, I'm still her brother.

174
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,520
We aren't

175
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,080
her brothers.

176
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm her neighbor,

177
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
while you were brought up by her dad.

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,520
It was fine in the first two years after we left.

179
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,280
However,

180
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,080
we seldom contacted with each other later

181
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,880
except sending holiday wishes.

182
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,320
We called but we didn't know what to say

183
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,780
except telling each other

184
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,300
to take care and eat well repeatedly.

185
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,570
We couldn't meet each other

186
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,920
or help each other.

187
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,410
Let's make an alliance.

188
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
What?

189
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,880
Don't pretend.

190
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,840
She always does what you say

191
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,040
since childhood.

192
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm sure you've

193
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
figured out a plan to

194
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,800
take her back.

195
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
I have no plan.

196
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,120
You'd better be mature

197
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,320
and adjust your mind.

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,440
It needs to take

199
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
time to nurture relation.

200
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
According to what you said,

201
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,740
certainly you have a plan.

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,560
Fine.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm going to work.

204
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,080
You won't make an alliance with me, right?

205
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Fine.

206
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
But, listen.

207
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,120
I've got an excellent plan

208
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
in my mind.

209
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,050
Don't beg me crying by the time.

210
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,400
Go back early.

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,130
Mr. Li misses you very much.

212
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,490
I'm leaving.

213
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Take care.

214
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,640
Hello.

215
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,040
So fast.

216
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,720
OK.

217
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,050
I'll be right there.

218
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
Hello, Ms.

219
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm Miss Qi, contacting with you

220
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,400
to do cleaning at 11: 30 a.m.

221
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,120
Right.

222
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,880
The one for deep cleaning of new residence.

223
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,760
Are you here?

224
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,160
OK.

225
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,080
I'll wait for you there.

226
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,040
Thank you.

227
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,120
The door is unlocked.

228
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,800
He has moved in?

229
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,880
How strange!

230
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,880
Ah. Ah.

231
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,600
What are you doing?

232
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
How did you get in?

233
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
I entered the password and came in.

234
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Tell me

235
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,520
how you came in.

236
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,280
The same way as you did.

237
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,410
This is my house.

238
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,080
Nonsense.

239
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,640
I rent it.

240
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,840
But I bought

241
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,640
the pillows,

242
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,840
the slippers

243
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,640
and the wallpaper.

244
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,120
Are you mistaken?

245
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
The house was

246
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
rented to others

247
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,040
3,000 yuan a month,

248
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,100
but you asked me to get it from others.

249
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,160
You spent 4,000 yuan

250
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
renting a two-roomed flat.

251
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,800
You can live in downtown with the rent.

252
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,720
It's worth living in a house

253
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,920
facing Li Jianjian's.

254
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,050
That's how the rich spend their money.

255
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,960
By the way,

256
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,660
the owner reminded me.

257
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,480
If the former tenant

258
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,960
comes to you,

259
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
tell him you're a relative of the owner.

260
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,760
As you return to work here,

261
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,240
the owner rents

262
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,100
the home to you.

263
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,970
Understand?

264
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,040
Yes. Enjoy it.

265
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
You're annoying.

266
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,640
Yeah.

267
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm a relative of the owner.

268
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,080
As I return to work here,

269
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
he rented the house to me.

270
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,840
Relative?

271
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm the nephew of the owner.

272
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,580
Didn't he tell you?

273
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,660
How about calling and asking him?

274
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,480
Hello, owner.

275
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,840
I am…

276
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
Hello. Miss Qi, right?

277
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,960
I was just about to call you.

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
I can't rent that house

279
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,960
to you.

280
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,440
One of my relative came to work here

281
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,160
from other place all of a sudden.

282
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,080
As my house

283
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
was available,

284
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,840
I rented it to him.

285
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,240
Please

286
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
tell me your account number.

287
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,160
I'll return

288
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,960
the deposit to you immediately.

289
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
We came to an agreement.

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,960
How can you break it?

291
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
I'm very sorry.

292
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm in a meeting right now.

293
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,100
That's all.

294
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,760
I…

295
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
Has she left?

296
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,040
No.

297
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,820
Come on.

298
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,600
I've told you

299
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,120
clearly.

300
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,380
Why are you still here?

301
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
Well.

302
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
Let's discuss.

303
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
I wanted to rent this house long before.

304
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
It's really

305
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,520
important to me.

306
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,840
Can you move out?

307
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
I'm familiar around here.

308
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,480
I can help you rent a house.

309
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,600
Why must you live here?

310
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,160
This house is important to me.

311
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,090
It's close to the subway entrance.

312
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,570
I'll tell you the truth.

313
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,680
I rented the house

314
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,280
for the boy on whom I have crush.

315
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,240
I helped him contact with the owner.

316
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,720
I must finish

317
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,320
the important task.

318
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
He'll move in tonight.

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,640
If I screw it up,

320
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,320
I can't face him.

321
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,840
My love comes to an end

322
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,800
before starting,

323
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,880
right?

324
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,570
It has nothing to do with me.

325
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Sir,

326
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm 25 years old,

327
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,680
but I haven't dated a boy.

328
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,960
My mom made me blind date.

329
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,760
I've decided

330
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,400
to cook for him every day

331
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
as long as he lives here.

332
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,200
Come out

333
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,130
and listen to me.

334
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,840
Calm down.

335
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,120
Listen.

336
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,640
I'm naked.

337
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm going out now.

338
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm going out.

339
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,400
Don't move, or I'll go out.

340
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,640
Well. I'm going out.

341
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,880
I'm going out now.

342
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,160
Du Juan,

343
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
I found the café.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,600
It seems to be

345
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
a new café.

346
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
It's near

347
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,160
our high school.

348
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,920
The boss saw your work

349
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,120
in the exhibition hall.

350
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
Have a good talk.

351
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,440
OK.

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,960
That's all. Bye-bye.

353
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,280
Excuse me?

354
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,720
Ah.

355
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,040
Ziqiu.

356
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,320
Can't you just tell me what you think

357
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,480
instead of scaring me?

358
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't want to scare you.

359
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm here to

360
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,540
prepare a surprise

361
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
for you.

362
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,240
Come on.

363
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,400
There was lightning and thunder outside.

364
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
I didn't expect it to rain.

365
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,240
What I imagined

366
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,840
was that

367
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,050
you would see

368
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,840
all these

369
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
when you came in.

370
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,240
Do you like it?

371
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,040
Don't you think

372
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,080
it looks like a scene

373
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,210
from a horror movie?

374
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,640
No.

375
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,560
I think,

376
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
I think it's romantic.

377
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,800
Why did you cheat me?

378
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,440
You even made

379
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,600
a block booking.

380
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,920
I didn't cheat you.

381
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,920
I want to make your wood carving

382
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,480
the treasure of my café.

383
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm running this café.

384
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,080
Me.

385
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,250
I'm the manager.

386
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,680
Why didn't I contact you

387
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,600
when I came back three months ago?

388
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,080
Because I was

389
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
preparing for opening.

390
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,360
I want to

391
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,240
call you and dad

392
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,720
before opening

393
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,080
and tell you there are

394
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,600
free coffee and cake coupons,

395
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,920
so you'll be

396
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,440
very surprised to find that

397
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,200
I open the café,

398
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,040
right?

399
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,520
Good idea.

400
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,200
Yeah.

401
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,880
But my dad is too busy

402
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,280
to come here.

403
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,680
But you'll be here

404
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,360
for free cake coupons.

405
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,120
I'll hang up

406
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,360
as soon as

407
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,840
I hear that.

408
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,720
I see.

409
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,560
Yes.

410
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,640
There are so many sales calls

411
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,360
these days.

412
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
That's what liars do.

413
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,410
Only idiots will come here.

414
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,720
But you wanted to be

415
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,040
the manager of

416
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,880
a dessert store

417
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,120
when you were a kid

418
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
to have cakes and milk tea

419
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,300
as you wish, right?

420
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,640
Come on.

421
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,970
Have a taste.

422
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,000
I made it.

423
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,540
Come on.

424
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,360
I went to see a dentist today.

425
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,560
I can't eat it.

426
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
I specially made it for you.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,760
Have a taste.

428
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,810
Here you are.

429
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,200
No.

430
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,840
One bite.

431
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Just one bite.

432
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
Have a taste.

433
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,540
Is it tasty?

434
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,680
Well. If you like it, take another bite.

435
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,010
Well.

436
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,920
Come on.

437
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm really sick.

438
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,280
Take another bite.

439
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,320
I can't eat any more.

440
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm sick.

441
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,920
Sorry.

442
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,920
No.

443
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,850
I should apologize.

444
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,800
You have prepared all these,

445
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,280
but I'm really sick.

446
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,800
By the way,

447
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
where are you going to

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,330
place the wood carving?

449
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,200
Reception.

450
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,770
It is in plain sight.

451
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,040
I tell you what,

452
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
forget the wood carving.

453
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,200
I'll carve a three-legged cicada for you

454
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
with another good piece

455
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
of wood material.

456
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
It means good luck.

457
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
You'll make it for me?

458
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,520
Yeah.

459
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,780
You prepared cakes for me, right?

460
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,240
The rain has stopped.

461
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,440
I'll go back to the studio.

462
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,360
Leave later, OK?

463
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,400
No. I'm occupied.

464
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,360
I'll walk you to the door.

465
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
No need. Just stay here.

466
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,000
Go back to your business.

467
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm leaving.

468
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,160
Take care.

469
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
See you.

470
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
What's going on?

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,520
He didn't even answer the phone.

472
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,840
He is so shameless.

473
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,400
Who?

474
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,280
The owner.

475
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,360
Our owner is good.

476
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,760
I don't mean ours.

477
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,440
Which owner do you mean?

478
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,520
Did you meet your boyfriend's parents

479
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,120
by dressing like that today?

480
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,640
They asked me to dress like that.

481
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,840
Well.

482
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,420
Do I look great?

483
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,440
Tang Can,

484
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
I'll tell you something.

485
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,960
Today I took Li Jianjian

486
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,280
to see a dentist.

487
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,120
The dentist is

488
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,720
Ling Xiao.

489
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Ling Xiao?

490
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,200
You mean

491
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,330
curve wrecker Ling Xiao in Singapore.

492
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,260
You've always been in touch with him?

493
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
He came back today.

494
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,160
He works in a dental hospital.

495
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,120
Why didn't Li Jianjian go alone?

496
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Why should you take her there?

497
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
If she has known it was her brother,

498
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,010
she wouldn't have gone.

499
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
Even so,

500
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,560
you needn't bother.

501
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
He is ungrateful.

502
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,880
All are ungrateful,

503
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,360
including the one went to Britain.

504
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,080
He is ultimately ungrateful.

505
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,560
He betrayed them.

506
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
You don't know what happened,

507
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,640
so don't be so outraged.

508
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,920
They have a complex family.

509
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
He's not what you imagine.

510
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,440
Don't speak for others, OK?

511
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,480
We should hit him

512
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,800
whenever we see him.

513
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,920
He is just a bit cold,

514
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,850
but not an enemy.

515
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,240
Tell me

516
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
where Ling Xiao works.

517
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
I'll hire 10 amateur actors online

518
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,720
to stop him at the gate of his hospital

519
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,250
and confess to him by turns.

520
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,440
Confess?

521
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm going to piss him off.

522
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,840
Forget it.

523
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,200
You said you would hit him

524
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,880
whenever you saw him, right?

525
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
He is coming.

526
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
Would you like to change

527
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,920
your professional clothes?

528
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,480
It'll be difficult for you to hit him dressing like that.

529
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,880
Why is he coming here?

530
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,900
Would you get changed?

531
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,240
No.

532
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,400
I'll wear whatever I want

533
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,880
in the house I rent.

534
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,640
I'm polite to him

535
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,880
as I dressed like this.

536
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,320
I'll ignore him

537
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,320
when he is here.

538
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,000
OK.

539
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,210
You're so great.

540
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Ling Xiao,

541
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,440
come in.

542
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,560
Jianjian hasn't come back yet,

543
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,880
but Tang Can is here.

544
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,160
Slippers.

545
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,800
OK.

546
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,480
Thanks.

547
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
Close the door for me.

548
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,120
Sorry.

549
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,560
Let me introduce.

550
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,610
This is Tang Can.

551
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,760
We were not good friends

552
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,680
when you graduated,

553
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,840
so you don't know her.

554
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
This is Ling Xiao.

555
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,090
Hello, Tang Can.

556
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,720
Hello.

557
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,460
I've heard a lot about you.

558
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Go to make tea.

559
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,940
The best black tea.

560
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,840
I'll sort things out.

561
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,700
Let me help you.

562
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,280
By the way,

563
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,000
you said

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
the house opposite isn't available.

565
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,920
What's going on?

566
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,200
The owner rented

567
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,440
it to his relative

568
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
coming here

569
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,400
instead of us.

570
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,080
The house opposite?

571
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,880
Isn't that my hero who rented it?

572
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,040
You agreed

573
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,320
to treat me to hot pot last night, right?

574
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,040
Why did you go to the toilet

575
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,800
when we were going to pay the bill?

576
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,240
No,

577
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,300
but you know

578
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,160
I suffer

579
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,320
gastrointestinal disorders,

580
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,920
right?

581
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,960
Fine.

582
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,330
It's my treat today.

583
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,050
Don't try to pay.

584
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,540
Eat whatever you like.

585
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,880
I know why the rich

586
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,480
are rich.

587
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,760
You're really stingy.

588
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,080
This is the celebration party you referred to.

589
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,360
Forget it.

590
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,840
I made a big table of desserts

591
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,080
for Li Jianjian,

592
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,370
but she took just a bite.

593
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,020
Fine. Let's forget it.

594
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,600
Come on.

595
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,240
Eat two strings of seafood first

596
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,040
as appetizer.

597
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,600
Seafood?

598
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,730
Isn't this seafood?

599
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,160
It's so fresh.

600
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,160
Well.

601
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Your sister doesn't lack money now?

602
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,680
If she really doesn't lack money,

603
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,610
what should I do?

604
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,800
I don't know

605
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,320
what she likes now.

606
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,800
You said Ling Xiao came back, right?

607
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
What about him?

608
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,800
It won't help.

609
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,720
She has been

610
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,440
closest to me since childhood.

611
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,520
She has nothing

612
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
to say to me,

613
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,680
let alone Ling Xiao.

614
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,280
Have you told her

615
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,540
you'll live opposite?

616
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,840
I have no time to tell her.

617
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,800
You should have gone home earlier

618
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,400
instead of preparing surprise,

619
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,040
so you might get help from your experienced dad.

620
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,560
Now you've trapped yourself.

621
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,680
You don't know.

622
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,360
It's exhausting to open a shop.

623
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,520
If I had told my dad,

624
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,080
he would have helped me

625
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,080
with decoration, procedures and others.

626
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,540
I don't want to bother him.

627
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,560
And

628
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,490
I haven't done anything for so many years.

629
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,330
I don't have the face to go back.

630
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,570
It smells great.

631
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm back.

632
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,800
Hi.

633
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,400
I met Ling Xiao today.

634
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,680
I knew that.

635
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,960
But you don't know that

636
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,720
I also met Ziqiu.

637
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
What?

638
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,120
Put it this way.

639
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,280
I met Ling Xiao

640
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,480
and Ziqiu yesterday.

641
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,760
Yesterday?

642
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,520
Ziqiu is the pervert

643
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,000
who felt my chest.

644
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,040
Pervert.

645
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
So dramatic.

646
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,440
He has become a pervert

647
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
after living abroad for years.

648
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,360
Oh, my.

649
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,820
It's a misunderstanding.

650
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,400
Ling Xiao rushed to the police station

651
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,520
when he knew what happened.

652
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,480
So we three

653
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,360
met

654
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,220
unexpectedly.

655
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,360
I thought it didn't matter

656
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,600
if we saw once in a while,

657
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
but I see them again today.

658
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,880
And he said

659
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
he would move to the house opposite.

660
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
It's great, right?

661
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
No. It's awkward.

662
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,400
Overwhelmingly awkward.

663
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,400
We don't even know what to talk about

664
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,930
when sitting together now.

665
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,240
Yeah.

666
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,160
I agree.

667
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,360
Shut up.

668
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,960
You're familiar with each other

669
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,720
as you often called, right?

670
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,080
No.

671
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,600
We just messaged on WeChat occasionally.

672
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,320
We just greeted

673
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,400
each other

674
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
and told each other

675
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,440
to take care.

676
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,770
It was just pretension.

677
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,200
We contacted in a formulated way.

678
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
We need to talk with each other

679
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
than just greeting if sitting together.

680
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
I can just listen to

681
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,600
my junior high school classmates'

682
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,360
conversations about their kids

683
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,440
when meeting them.

684
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,040
That's because

685
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,440
you don't live together.

686
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,040
It's better

687
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,880
as he came back, right?

688
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,920
But…

689
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,040
Let's put it this way.

690
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,120
For example,

691
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,600
you get two cans of

692
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,720
expired yellow peach,

693
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,840
but you find

694
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
they are edible.

695
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,800
However, you feel uneasy

696
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,600
when eating them.

697
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,200
Don't eat

698
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,680
expired food.

699
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,600
Oh, it's so confusing.

700
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,040
Don't kick me.

701
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,920
It hurts.

702
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,440
There is a gingival inflammation cycle.

703
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,600
Remember to gargle and take anti-inflammatory drugs

704
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,000
after eating these days.

705
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,440
Ling Xiao,

706
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,800
when are you going to move in?

707
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,320
The house I ordered was rented

708
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,920
to a relative of the owner.

709
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,210
A cool man moved in the house opposite.

710
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,760
Do you know him?

711
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,920
No.

712
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,480
But Mingyue

713
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,840
is so familiar with him.

714
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,560
She has seen

715
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,600
him naked.

716
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,720
No,

717
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,760
I haven't.

718
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,160
Don't talk nonsense.

719
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,400
You told me about that.

720
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,680
It's the most classic plot

721
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,400
even in idol dramas

722
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,000
to see a hero

723
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,480
taking shower.

724
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,040
No.

725
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,360
My story of meeting the man at the elevator

726
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,760
is inferior to it.

727
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,480
No.

728
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,440
I actually wanted to

729
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,720
drive him away.

730
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,400
Don't, don't do that.

731
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,260
Certainly relatives come first.

732
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
There should be other houses

733
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,420
to rent in this community.

734
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,210
But there isn't a suitable one.

735
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,720
Moreover,

736
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,240
it'll be more convenient if he lives opposite.

737
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,640
According to Qi Mingyue,

738
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,240
he lives

739
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,280
there alone

740
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,840
in a flat with two rooms.

741
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,480
It should be hard-pressed

742
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,360
for him to pay the high rent

743
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,690
as he just began to work.

744
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,280
You want to rent jointly.

745
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,920
Yes.

746
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,300
OK. I'll help you to convince him.

747
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,200
I'll go.

748
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,080
I won't give you a chance

749
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,240
to meet each other.

750
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm going to make up.

751
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,680
Don't bother in the evening.

752
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,000
I'll amaze him.

753
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,320
Sir,

754
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,640
hello.

755
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,880
Tang Can.

756
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,360
I never dreamed that

757
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
you were my neighbor.

758
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,160
Gosh.

759
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,500
How did she know it?

760
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,680
You looked familiar

761
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,120
when I saw you at the elevator last time.

762
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,820
I was too careless.

763
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
You look like

764
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,360
my next boyfriend.

765
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,600
Why are you attacking me?

766
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
It hurts.

767
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,520
He Ziqiu.

768
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,120
How come it's you?

769
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,120
The house was rented out,

770
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,000
but I asked my friend to

771
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
convince the owner

772
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,480
by paying a higher rent.

773
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Now that others paid him 3,000 yuan,

774
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,410
I pay 4,000 yuan.

775
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,800
If someone make troubles,

776
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
I'll tell him I'm a relative of the owner

777
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,200
and come to work here.

778
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,960
The former tenant

779
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,160
believed what I said.

780
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,760
It's great to be rich?

781
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,320
I want to be

782
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,480
close to Li Jianjian,

783
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,810
so as to take care of her.

784
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
I'm the former tenant

785
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
of the house.

786
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,360
What?

787
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,620
The girl this morning…

788
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,920
Thank God.

789
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,420
Luckily, it wasn't me.

790
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,720
I see.

791
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,200
The boy you mentioned…

792
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Shut up.

793
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,040
You even pretended to be a relative of the owner.

794
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,920
You're odious.

795
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,680
It has never been heard of before.

796
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,140
It's infuriatingly rude.

797
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,170
What's going on?

798
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,410
Why do you come in without consent?

799
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,490
I know the password.

800
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,440
Well.

801
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,880
I want to apologize for

802
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,560
spilling water on you.

803
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm sorry.

804
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,960
But I just want to

805
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,090
make it clear to you.

806
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,960
Don't tell Ling Xiao

807
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,800
whatever I said

808
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
to you today.

809
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,880
Why?

810
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,120
Tell him clearly

811
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,320
if you like him.

812
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,000
It's,

813
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,170
it's not the right time now.

814
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,200
Anyway, don't tell him.

815
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,040
If you tell him,

816
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,410
I'll, I'll tell them

817
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,800
you're physically defective.

818
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,200
You're starting a rumor.

819
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,800
Anyway, we're here alone.

820
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,280
I can say whatever I want.

821
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,960
I remember

822
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,560
you were kind in high school.

823
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,920
What do you want to do?

824
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,040
Ling Xiao.

825
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,280
May I come in?

826
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,630
Sure.

827
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,170
Have a good talk with Ling Xiao.

828
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,760
OK.

829
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,000
Go.

830
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,710
Not bad.

831
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,120
It's my house now.

832
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,250
Let's rent jointly.

833
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,280
If you beg me,

834
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,530
I'll think about it.

835
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:39,880
Please.

836
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,400
OK.

837
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,480
I'll move here a few days later.

838
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,440
I'll give you a hand with your luggage.

839
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,080
No need. There is not much luggage.

840
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,560
Wait.

841
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,600
We should ask the owner for the extra rent, right?

842
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,000
Sure.

843
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,710
He should pay for the price of

844
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,110
making you his "nephew."

845
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,400
He must return

846
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,130
the extra rent he asked for.

847
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,800
No. I'm not his nephew.

848
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,000
It's late.

849
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,320
Go home now.

850
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm not sleepy.

851
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,360
I'll be here with you for a while.

852
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,760
You're waiting for Ling Xiao.

853
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,240
Don't use me as an excuse.

854
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,840
No, I'm not.

855
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,680
As he returned,

856
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
I can see him

857
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,740
whenever I want to.

858
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
If you really want to see him,

859
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,090
don't let him live outside.

860
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,680
It's great to have him live at home.

861
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,080
You can see him every day.

862
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,100
I want him to live outside.

863
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,160
I've got used to

864
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,200
living alone.

865
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,560
His sudden invasion

866
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,080
into my life will be

867
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,960
an annoyance

868
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,560
to me.

869
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
Come on.

870
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,640
You are smiling

871
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,040
so happily.

872
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,620
Lift your feet.

873
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,320
Well.

874
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,960
I think it'll be great

875
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,960
for Ling Xiao

876
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,740
to marry Jianjian.

877
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,610
A good match.

878
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,520
Don't try to

879
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,800
arrange marriage for young people now.

880
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,320
I don't think so.

881
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,720
They deserve each other.

882
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,680
I can tell that

883
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,800
he likes Jianjian.

884
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,640
Do you want to

885
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,080
be a matchmaker

886
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,240
like Mrs. Qian?

887
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,000
I'll stick you a pad.

888
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,000
Mr. Li.

889
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,920
Hi.

890
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,560
Dad, why are you here?

891
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,120
You have to work

892
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,520
tomorrow morning, right?

893
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,880
Well. Well.

894
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,200
I wanted to go upstairs long ago,

895
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,240
but he asked me

896
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,920
to talk with him here.

897
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,840
Yes.

898
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,600
I'm so lonely that

899
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,240
I ask you to stay here with me.

900
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,480
Don't stand still.

901
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Go back

902
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
and rest earlier.

903
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,260
Go back.

904
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
I'll help with cleaning.

905
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,160
No.

906
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,160
I just cleaned it.

907
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,040
Don't step on it.

908
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,000
Go home now.

909
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,260
Yes. You standing here

910
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,360
may hinder him.

911
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,280
Go back now.

912
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,080
Take a shower.

913
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I'll go back soon.

914
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,120
OK. See you

915
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
You said he hindered me.

916
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,680
I didn't really mean it.

917
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,560
You have a low EQ.

918
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,200
Who are you talking about?

919
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,400
You have a low EQ.

920
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,920
Jump out of here.

921
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,080
Don't step on it.

922
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,360
That's how you deal with me.

923
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,980
Morning, Li Jianjian.

924
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,880
What would you like to eat in the morning?

925
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,940
I'll buy it for you.

926
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,080
No. It sounds too exciting.

927
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,520
Morning, Li Jianjian.

928
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,260
What would you like to eat?

929
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,520
I have no food at home.

930
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,740
What do you want to eat?

931
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,460
What would you like to eat?

932
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,290
What would you like to have?

933
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,620
What, what would you like to have?

934
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,660
What would you…

935
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,840
Are you asleep?

936
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,960
The pain is hidden under the skin.

937
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,360
When fate befalls,

938
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,120
make the bed for death

939
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,000
with mercy and peace.

940
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,720
Ah!

941
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,460
What are you doing?

942
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,680
Come in.

943
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,800
Ladies,

944
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,800
it's 1 o'clock in the morning.

945
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,000
You're ugly.

946
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,300
Go to bed early.

947
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,200
Will I miss him

948
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,520
regretfully?

949
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,160
You think too much.

950
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,360
Maybe he has been

951
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,440
married for five years

952
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,480
and has children.

953
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,840
Those who have appeared are not

954
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,360
those we want to meet.

955
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,660
Who don't you want to meet?

956
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,320
Don't be so harsh.

957
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,960
Finally they reunite

958
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,090
after so many years.

959
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,480
Come on.

960
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,760
We'll naturally part with

961
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,360
our siblings

962
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,760
when we grow up.

963
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,520
In particularly, after we get married

964
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
and have our own families,

965
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,080
we become relatives.

966
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,440
Is it necessary for them

967
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
to live near each other?

968
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,600
Yes.

969
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,400
Many people love

970
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,360
their siblings.

971
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,920
They help each other by living near each other.

972
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,080
Give me an example

973
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,960
of siblings loving each other

974
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,040
and taking care of each other

975
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,440
after they get married.

976
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
Come on.

977
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920
What did you say?

978
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,260
Give me an example.

979
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
You can't, right?

980
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,880
Even so,

981
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
there are no such siblings.

982
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,280
There are families

983
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,880
like that

984
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,760
of Li Jianjian's,

985
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
even if it's rare.

986
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,560
Don't be so arbitrary.

987
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,600
What matters isn't

988
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,400
my judgment,

989
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,840
but what she thinks about.

990
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
She has said nothing,

991
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,840
but you keep talking.

992
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,660
Are you going to be the Savior?

993
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,080
Li Jianjian,

994
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,960
do you also think that

995
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,760
I put my finger into your pie?

996
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
No.

997
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,520
Did you hear?

998
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,920
But I think what

999
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,380
Tang Can said makes sense.

1000
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,960
Did you hear?

1001
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
Don't sway.

1002
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
What do you think?

1003
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,240
Oh!

1004
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,760
We used to

1005
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,360
be good friends,

1006
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,880
but that was because

1007
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,360
we were kids.

1008
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,200
But later…

1009
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,400
When I was student,

1010
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,960
I did wish

1011
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,160
for them to come back

1012
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,130
even for just one time on holidays,

1013
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,660
but neither of them came back.

1014
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,560
Gradually

1015
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
I forgot them.

1016
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,840
Now they returned

1017
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,080
suddenly,

1018
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,560
I feel nervous

1019
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,320
and awkward.

1020
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,840
I feel

1021
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,600
they're strangers to me.

1022
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,920
It's not the same as before.
