1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,910
Episode 12

4
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Mingyue.

5
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,190
You called me?

6
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,490
I called you yesterday.

7
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,360
I had an interview in the mountains yesterday,

8
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
so the signal over there was weak.

9
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,060
Why did you get up so early?

10
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,700
The sculpture exhibition is held today.

11
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,960
I almost forgot it.

12
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,430
I'm very busy these days.

13
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
You have been on a business trip for a week.

14
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,690
Are you going to abandon us?

15
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,910
I'm back.

16
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,240
I'm going to get my new car

17
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,640
and then pick someone up at the airport.

18
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,000
You're a winner.

19
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Of course.

20
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,600
You can only envy me.

21
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,910
If you still have a toothache,

22
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,320
remember to take a painkiller.

23
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,580
And I'll take you to pull it out tomorrow.

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,930
No need. No need.

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,160
If you use the toaster,

26
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,470
keep an eye on it.

27
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,470
Don't forget that

28
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,670
its automatic pop-up button is broken.

29
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,720
Bye.

30
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh, no.

31
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,390
Oh.

32
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh my God.

33
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,960
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

34
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,159
Well,

35
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
would you like a chewing gum?

36
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,440
Excuse me. Excuse me.

37
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,070
Thank you.

38
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,250
Two bowls of beef noodles.

39
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,350
Waiter, give me some tissues.

40
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,070
OK.

41
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,690
Two bowls of beef noodles.

42
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,330
Two bowls of seafood noodles.

43
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,770
Noodles will be served.

44
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,000
Beef noodles.

45
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,480
Pork Noodles with Pickled Vegetables.

46
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,040
Thank you.

47
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,000
Pickles.

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
Please enjoy.

49
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,670
Haichao!

50
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,880
Mrs. Qian.

51
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,160
A bowl of pea noodles with more peas.

52
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,760
OK. I see.

53
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,420
You hang another banner here.

54
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,830
Jianjian is really promising.

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,640
She has won many awards.

56
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,200
What did she carve?

57
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,880
I don't know.

58
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,320
But she won the first prize,

59
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
and her wood carving is still on display today.

60
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,790
The first prize?

61
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,440
What's the bonus?

62
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,390
The after-tax bonus is over 20,000 yuan.

63
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,880
Oh.

64
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,950
So much.

65
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,270
Haichao,

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,440
anyway,

67
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,040
Jianjian's job

68
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,000
is insecure.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,530
Sometimes she is also idle.

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,600
It's better to be a civil servant,

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,390
right?

72
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,450
Yes, you're right.

73
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,600
Jianjian has moved out

74
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,760
for almost one year, right?

75
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,390
Yes,

76
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,440
one year.

77
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,510
Well,

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,270
I had told you that

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,270
your children would leave sooner or later.

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,670
Your three children stayed here,

81
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,320
but now

82
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,950
no one accompanies you.

83
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,180
The family is not complete at all.

84
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,270
When I meet a good woman,

85
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,790
I'll introduce her to you.

86
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,550
You should get married.

87
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,230
OK.

88
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,110
There are vacant seats inside.

89
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,040
Go in and have a seat.

90
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,440
OK.

91
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,920
Mr. Li,

92
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,950
your cell phone is ringing.

93
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm going to serve the noodles for you.

94
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
Hello, Heping. Go on.

95
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,450
Ling Xiao will come back today?

96
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,510
Well,

97
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,320
even if you're busy catching the suspect,

98
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,790
you can't forget it.

99
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,830
He hadn't come back for 9 years.

100
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,320
Ling Xiao.

101
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,550
Sorry. I'm late.

102
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,640
It doesn't matter.

103
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,240
Long time no see, Qi Mingyue.

104
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,250
Long time no see.

105
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,340
I almost couldn't recognize you.

106
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,200
Let's go.

107
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Sorry to bother you.

108
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,830
In fact, I can

109
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,690
go back by taxi.

110
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,040
That's okay.

111
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,600
It's been 2 days since my business trip.

112
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,670
I asked two days off,

113
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,510
so I'm idle.

114
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,120
I just bought a new car

115
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,270
and want to try it,

116
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,110
but I don't know whether you dare get in my car or not.

117
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,110
You bought a car? Congratulations.

118
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,440
Get in the car.

119
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,150
Man,

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,700
what are you doing?

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,240
Ling Xiao,

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
this is my car.

123
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,640
Sorry.

124
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,670
Sorry.

125
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,080
Your car is good.

126
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,110
Thank you.

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Your cell phone is buzzing.

128
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Why not answer it?

129
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,670
It's just a disturbance call.

130
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,320
OK.

131
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,820
It has changed a lot

132
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,710
over these years.

133
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,640
Yeah.

134
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,760
Bridges, roads and houses

135
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,880
are built everywhere

136
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,280
as urban fringe expands.

137
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,710
It has been many years since you left.

138
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm afraid that you can't

139
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,710
find the way home.

140
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,350
But don't worry.

141
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,640
You have much time to get familiar with it as you came back.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,570
I'll show you around this weekend.

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,200
No need.

144
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,670
Your greatest help to me is

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,930
renting a house for me.

146
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,480
Thank you very much.

147
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,080
After I settle down, I'll treat you to dinner.

148
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,520
We're old friends.

149
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,790
Don't mention it.

150
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,930
But I'd like to have a meal.

151
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,640
OK.

152
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,520
Go wherever you like.

153
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,000
OK.

154
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,040
By the way,

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,350
Li Jianjian's award-winning work

156
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,440
is on display today.

157
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,590
She is going to the exhibition.

158
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,050
I've kept a ticket for you.

159
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,910
Anyway, you came back

160
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,350
to surprise her.

161
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,230
How about…

162
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,880
No need.

163
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,400
I have other plans.

164
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,790
Send me home directly.

165
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,880
Well, OK.

166
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,400
Ling Xiao...

167
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,910
Do you mind if I take a nap?

168
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,280
I'm a little sleepy.

169
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,350
OK. OK.

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,080
Du Juan.

171
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,320
Well.

172
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:24,910
Do you want to listen to

173
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,040
these new comments?

174
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,760
If they're bad ones, forget it.

175
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,110
Come on. Be confident, OK?

176
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,030
You'll be a great artist in the future.

177
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,590
Listen.

178
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,640
They said

179
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,110
this work of art is so vivid that

180
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,760
it reminded them of

181
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
their childhood.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,080
They wondered if there were

183
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,440
prototypes of these figures.

184
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,080
Yes.

185
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,880
Forget it.

186
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,640
A work of one of my friends

187
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,550
was also awarded.

188
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,550
I want to find out where it is.

189
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,280
What's the name?

190
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,010
Dream Lover.

191
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,050
Dream Lover?

192
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,350
Over there.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,930
Don't hurry. Oh.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,730
Don't hurry.

195
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
You always said on the phone that you wanted to

196
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,110
have noodles I made.

197
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,030
Well.

198
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,420
Is it the taste you missed?

199
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,030
Yes, it is.

200
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
I really missed food you made

201
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
when I was in Singapore these years.

202
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm not bragging.

203
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,440
Only food I made

204
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,880
suits the tastes

205
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,640
of you three.

206
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,790
Yeah.

207
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,790
If you had told me

208
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,920
you’re coming back,

209
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,640
I would have made

210
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,770
all dishes you like.

211
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,910
I couldn't determine when to come back

212
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,280
and didn't want you to always think about it,

213
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,010
so I didn't tell you in advance.

214
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,720
You're so sensible.

215
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,470
How time flies!

216
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,200
You're grown up.

217
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
These years slipped

218
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
away so quickly.

219
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,670
Over these years,

220
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,550
without you and Ziqiu,

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,710
I've always

222
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,000
watched the door

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,660
standing behind the counter.

224
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,910
I always felt that

225
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,710
you three would run in quickly

226
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,550
as if you were still kids.

227
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,400
I'll settle down here

228
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,320
this time.

229
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,000
Your mom won't agree.

230
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,380
As you're all here,

231
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,550
it's impossible for me

232
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,010
to stay abroad all my life.

233
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,550
I got a job before coming here.

234
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,710
I'll start to work tomorrow.

235
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,110
You even got a job.

236
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,670
So great. Well.

237
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,050
I'll tell Jianjian about that.

238
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,880
She will be thrilled

239
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,880
to know you're coming back.

240
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,400
Jianjian.

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,640
Well.

242
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,230
Well, come back now.

243
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,520
Listen.

244
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,390
Where are you?

245
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,110
Police station?

246
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,320
As such a handsome

247
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,520
young man, you

248
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,670
even had cheek to molest.

249
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,800
You're ashamed now.

250
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,410
Don't cover your face.

251
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,960
Madam,

252
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,150
I've repeated it so many times.

253
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,080
I didn't molest.

254
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,710
You just admitted that

255
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,590
you felt

256
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
a girl's chest in the exhibition hall.

257
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,790
I didn't feel her.

258
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,520
I touched her

259
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,520
by accident.

260
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,440
I helped her

261
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,370
as she fell down.

262
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,230
We'll find out if you were intentional

263
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,560
in surveillance video.

264
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,200
If you are innocent,

265
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,710
you won't be wronged.

266
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,200
Sit here quietly.

267
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,400
The girl who called the police

268
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
will be here soon.

269
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,680
Madam,

270
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,400
please,

271
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,760
please release me now.

272
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,400
I can't

273
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,350
meet her.

274
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,300
Do you fear?

275
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,550
But you didn't fear at all

276
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,550
when you felt her.

277
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,550
Madam,

278
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,110
I was wrong.

279
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,640
I'll tell the truth for a lighter sentence.

280
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,320
Can I leave if I

281
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,000
pay a fine?

282
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,230
Right.

283
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,590
Tell the truth and you will receive a lighter sentence.

284
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,280
But as to how to

285
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,150
deal with it,

286
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,750
we'll discuss with the girl.

287
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,320
Don't move. Sit still.

288
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
Yes. He is here.

289
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,800
Let that girl come here.

290
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,840
OK.

291
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,440
Madam,

292
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,790
it is him.

293
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,910
He grabbed my chest

294
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,520
and even pinched it.

295
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,550
No, I didn't.

296
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,610
I thought it was your belly.

297
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,170
You shouldn't have felt me.

298
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,030
I used to…

299
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,400
You admit it.

300
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,470
Madam, did you hear it?

301
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,930
He is a habitual offender.

302
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,150
You pervert.

303
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,640
Show me

304
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,470
your face.

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,080
Catch the pervert.

306
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,590
He felt my chest.

307
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,280
Tell me.

308
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,960
Where and who have you molested?

309
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,520
How many victims have you molested?

310
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,590
I'll repeat it.

311
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,790
Tell the truth and you will receive a lighter sentence.

312
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,440
I didn't do that.

313
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,530
You deny it, right?

314
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,230
OK.

315
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
Let's talk about

316
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,430
your pinching her belly.

317
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,150
There used to be fat

318
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,440
on her belly when she was a little girl,

319
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,230
so I often…

320
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,240
Right.

321
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,090
It was interesting.

322
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,360
Why do you sound so familiar?

323
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,020
You heard me wrong.

324
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,110
Turn round.

325
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,790
No.

326
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,640
Turn

327
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,640
round.

328
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,760
Ziqiu.

329
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,010
You've lost weight?

330
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,069
No.

331
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,280
Over 100 jin.

332
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,730
You've gained weight?

333
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,470
No.

334
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,040
Over 100 jin.

335
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,920
OK.

336
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,830
When did you come back?

337
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,520
Why didn't you tell us?

338
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,400
I wanted to

339
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,520
surprise you.

340
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,160
But I didn't expect it

341
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
to be such a mess.

342
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,470
You did surprise me.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,400
Well.

344
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,190
I won't tell

345
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,470
my dad your coming back,

346
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,070
so you can surprise him.

347
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,680
As planned.

348
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,950
OK.

349
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,830
Li Jianjian.

350
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,800
He Ziqiu.

351
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,470
Well.

352
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,160
Why didn't you tell me before coming back?

353
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,760
You should be abroad, right?

354
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,470
You didn't tell me, either.

355
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,470
I just came back.

356
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,110
I kept it from you

357
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,430
to surprise

358
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,760
all of you.

359
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
What a coincidence!

360
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,160
Me, too.

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,070
Never mind.

362
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,800
You both surprised me.

363
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,470
How is your family?

364
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,710
How is your mom?

365
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,760
She is fine.

366
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,350
I'm fine.

367
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
I'm fine.

368
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,230
OK. OK.

369
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:56,740
All is well.

370
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,340
thats good

371
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,400
Oh, what a shame.

372
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,190
I'm occupied today.

373
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,830
Our toaster oven doesn't work.

374
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,520
Mingyue asked me to buy a new one.

375
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,160
I must go now,

376
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,310
or I'll be late for the mall.

377
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,640
Well,

378
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
How about treating you

379
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,920
to dinner another day?

380
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,800
You can go ahead.

381
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Bye-bye. I'm leaving.

382
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,160
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

383
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm late.

384
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,170
Bye. Bye.

385
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,470
Did your mom allow you to come back?

386
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,400
Did your dad allow you to come back?

387
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,830
After so many years,

388
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,280
you're still so bad at socialising

389
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Oh. Well.

390
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,160
I missed you so much, but you let me down.

391
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,640
Really?

392
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,720
Why can't I tell that?

393
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,280
You were too busy

394
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
to send me a message usually.

395
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,190
You, either.

396
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,430
I didn't miss you.

397
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,920
Are you going to leave again

398
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,880
or…

399
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,560
I've got a job

400
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,040
in a stomatological hospital.

401
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,840
How about you?

402
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,230
I came back to start my own business.

403
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,680
I feel

404
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,250
disgusting to watch the sea with you.

405
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,160
Me, too.

406
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
So I'm going home.

407
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,470
Are you going back with me?

408
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,280
No.

409
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,280
By the way,

410
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,400
don't tell my dad that

411
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,110
I came back.

412
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,520
I want to

413
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
surprise him.

414
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,360
Where are you going to stay?

415
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,920
I…

416
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,890
I forget it.

417
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,240
You have much money.

418
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,590
I'm leaving.

419
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,640
OK.

420
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
How about you?

421
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,590
I want to watch the sea

422
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,950
alone.

423
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,590
Then enjoy it.

424
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,330
Bye-bye.

425
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,800
Well. Eat meat.

426
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,250
I wanted to come back earlier,

427
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,430
but I was delayed

428
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,880
by my work.

429
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,160
Ling Xiao.

430
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,190
Well. Have more meat.

431
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,850
Never mind.

432
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,770
I know you're busy.

433
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
Let me drink with you.

434
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,040
You can drink.

435
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,310
I drank a bit when engaging in

436
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,400
social activities with my leaders

437
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,330
in the hospital.

438
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,280
You heard what he said.

439
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,520
He is grown up suddenly.

440
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
A young man.

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,800
But you should

442
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,760
drink less, dad.

443
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,470
You told me on the phone that

444
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,600
you got gout, right?

445
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Well. Look. Look.

446
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,520
He restricts me as soon as he comes back.

447
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,160
You need restriction.

448
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,190
Yeah. You're right.

449
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,850
Ling Xiao, restrict your dad.

450
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,400
You should avoid certain food because of gout.

451
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Don't eat seafood.

452
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,950
Don't eat shrimp.

453
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,830
In all conscience,

454
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,520
who bought seafood?

455
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,430
You bought it.

456
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,560
I bought for myself.

457
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,230
We bought it.

458
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,230
Don't eat.

459
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,160
Well.

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,760
It's late.

461
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,830
Why hasn't

462
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,960
Jianjian come back?

463
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,460
Don't wait for her.

464
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,430
She called and told me

465
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:34,920
that

466
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,950
she was going to come back,

467
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,880
but she was delayed by

468
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,110
a sudden order her studio received.

469
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,830
I see.

470
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,430
Ling Xiao,

471
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,640
ask Jianjian to show you

472
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,000
around her studio.

473
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,920
I visited it.

474
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,200
It's very artistic.

475
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,400
OK.

476
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
It's great that you're back.

477
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
It's great that you're back.

478
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,640
Only Ziqiu is absent now.

479
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,130
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

480
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,800
Maybe he'll come back

481
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,860
suddenly someday.

482
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,350
Come on.

483
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,680
Don't fool me.

484
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,700
Eat shrimp.

485
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,230
The shrimp is fresh. Fish ball.

486
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,030
Eat fish ball.

487
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,400
Here you are.

488
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,800
Dad, Mr. Li,

489
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,430
cheers.

490
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,000
OK.

491
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,050
Come on.

492
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,350
He offered a toast.

493
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,680
Certainly we'll drink.

494
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,570
Cheers.

495
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,800
Sir,

496
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,350
we're closed.

497
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,890
Come tomorrow if you want to have noodles.

498
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,590
I just came here for a look.

499
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,250
Never mind.

500
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,000
He has been here

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,230
for several times.

502
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,650
What did he look at?

503
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,890
Don't worry about my work.

504
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,940
The contract has been signed.

505
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,280
Eat hot pot?

506
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,470
OK.

507
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
It's your turn this time.

508
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
OK. See you later.

509
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,070
I think

510
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,510
I've seen you somewhere.

511
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,400
Me, too.

512
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,250
Don't look at them.

513
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,430
Sorry.

514
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,800
Hey, you…

515
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,070
Mom. Mom, open the door. Mom.

516
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,590
Hi.

517
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,040
I just called

518
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,350
to ask you

519
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:56,880
if you want to buy

520
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,190
any daily necessities.

521
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,830
Anyway, I'll go to

522
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,800
the supermarket later.

523
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,200
I can help you to buy them.

524
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,470
Don't stand on ceremony.

525
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,340
After all, we've been friends for so many years.

526
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,160
OK.

527
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,070
Go ahead.

528
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,210
Bye-bye.

529
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,680
Mom.

530
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,920
God!

531
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,350
I just met a man

532
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,640
at the elevator.

533
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,430
I also met one today.

534
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
It's different.

535
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,520
As God is my witness,

536
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,710
my very moment

537
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
came.

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
Can you speak in a normal way?

539
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,000
It's like the crush

540
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,160
between a man and a woman

541
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,350
in an idol drama.

542
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,920
I found his pen.

543
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,430
According to the plot,

544
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,030
it must be an important prop.

545
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,190
Maybe

546
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,110
it'll be

547
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,760
our love token.

548
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,570
What's the name of the man?

549
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,950
I don't know.

550
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,880
He ran away.

551
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,640
Well.

552
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,470
Did you give him your phone number?

553
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:07,950
No.

554
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,040
Then how are you going to meet him again?

555
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,830
In the dream?

556
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,480
I've observed everything.

557
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,540
Of four households on this floor,

558
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,420
two are owners,

559
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,430
and we and the household opposite are tenants.

560
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,190
The former tenant

561
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,070
moved last month.

562
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,470
The house was available.

563
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,280
I'm sure

564
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,520
he lives there.

565
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,800
I see.

566
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,710
The dirty clothes of you and Li Jianjian

567
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,520
in the past week have been cleaned.

568
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,450
Please air them.

569
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,900
That's your reaction?

570
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,430
Go.

571
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,920
God.

572
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,190
My little pity,

573
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,640
it's been

574
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,350
a bad day for you.

575
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,640
What did the dirty groundhog

576
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,800
do to you?

577
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,110
Drama queen.

578
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,070
You know it.

579
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,710
Du Juan posted

580
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,070
it on Moments.

581
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,580
What's the result?

582
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,430
They took him

583
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,230
into custody?

584
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,680
No.

585
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,280
He molested you. Why not?

586
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,400
No.

587
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,040
It's misunderstanding.

588
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,830
He felt your chest. No way.

589
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
He thought it was my belly.

590
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,310
Don't believe what he said.

591
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,160
You have a toothache. Don't eat candy.

592
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,470
These are sugar free lollipops

593
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,040
Tang Can bought for me.

594
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,440
Give it to me.

595
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,370
Li Jianjian.

596
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,920
This is for kids

597
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,560
for tooth decay prevention.

598
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Tang Can,

599
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,680
don't spoil her.

600
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,410
Look at the stains on her teeth.

601
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,230
I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow

602
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,680
and have your tooth extracted.

603
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,590
I agree.

604
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,710
Look.

605
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,800
I don't have a toothache at all.

606
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,280
I will take painkillers

607
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,880
if it hurts.

608
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,680
Li Jianjian,

609
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,680
you're not a kid.

610
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,080
Are you still afraid of visiting a dentist?

611
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,050
Let's talk about it later.

612
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,280
By the way,

613
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,470
do you know who I just met

614
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,330
at the entrance to the community?

615
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,880
Who?

616
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,000
The school fellow

617
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,160
of the basketball club

618
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,920
in our high school.

619
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,040
The gorilla.

620
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,230
Gorilla?

621
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,430
Why have I never heard of it?

622
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,070
You cared nobody

623
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,280
in high school.

624
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,800
Mom,

625
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
I am hungry.

626
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,350
What are we

627
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,560
going to eat tonight?

628
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,160
Soil.

629
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,010
Hang up the clothes

630
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,970
Air the clothes.

631
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,190
God.

632
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You eat hastily.

633
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,880
Well.

634
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,590
Great.

635
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,310
We have a good harvest today.

636
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,110
I'll reward you with a story.

637
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
What's the story?

638
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,800
I'll tell you the story

639
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
of three good friends, OK?

640
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,520
It's…

641
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,770
What is this?

642
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,470
Beans.

643
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,040
Right?

644
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,410
What's this? Corn.

645
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,400
What's this? Pumpkin.

646
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,330
Right. Pumpkin.

647
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,070
Why are they three

648
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,920
good friends?

649
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,760
The root of the bean

650
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,710
can work amazingly.

651
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,840
It keeps the nitrogen (dan)

652
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,310
in the field.

653
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,530
What's the effect of nitrogen?

654
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,400
It can

655
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,040
make corn grow tall,

656
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,160
so the thin stems

657
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,590
of beans

658
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,700
can climb along it.

659
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,190
Why is

660
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
pumpkin

661
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,820
their good friend?

662
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,280
Look.

663
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,680
The leaves of the pumpkin

664
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,560
are so big that

665
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,590
they can keep out the wind and rain.

666
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,830
That's why

667
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,310
they're good friends.

668
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,710
Tell me.

669
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,070
Who are they like?

670
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,450
They are like us.

671
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,520
Right.

672
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,950
They're like you three.

673
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,680
Dad,

674
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,640
why are there eggs (dan) in the soil?

675
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Idiot.

676
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,590
You don't even know that.

677
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,190
They are laid by chickens.

678
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,640
You two are idiots.

679
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
He meant a kind of nutrient.

680
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,560
Yes.

681
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,350
I didn't mean eggs.

682
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,400
Cluck. Cluck. Cluck.

683
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,070
I didn't mean eggs.

684
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,920
Hahaha, what a coincidence today!

685
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,110
Are you scared?

686
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,710
I'm so happy to see

687
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,760
you and Ling Xiao today.

688
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,830
Now you're…

689
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,830
Did you go home today?

690
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,680
Did you tell dad about

691
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,710
my coming back?

692
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,560
Your dad still looks the same.

693
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,830
He'll return to work

694
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,040
as soon as he is called.

695
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,370
Even his old age can't deter him from work.

696
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,830
Sleep in Ziqiu's

697
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,190
room tonight.

698
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,160
I often clean up his room.

699
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,090
It's very clean.

700
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,950
I'll clean up your room

701
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,410
when I have time tomorrow.

702
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,230
Mr. Li,

703
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
your shoulders often hurt.

704
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,040
I can do it by myself.

705
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,770
Don't worry.

706
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,080
I can do it by myself.

707
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,400
Mr. Li,

708
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,710
don't bother

709
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,640
clean up my room.

710
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,160
I asked my friend

711
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,310
to help me rent a house.

712
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,710
What?

713
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,370
Are you going to move out, too?

714
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,720
My house faces Jianjian's.

715
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,470
Well.

716
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,040
OK.

717
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,889
I can set my mind at rest.

718
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,840
Well. Did,

719
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,480
did you tell her when meeting her today?

720
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,000
I didn't have time to tell her.

721
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,389
She asked about my family

722
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,389
and then left.

723
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,150
Maybe

724
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,889
she isn't familiar with me.

725
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,429
Yeah.

726
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,840
You haven't met for so many years.

727
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,500
No wonder you're unfamiliar.

728
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,800
Think about it.

729
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,230
When you left,

730
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,690
she was just a little girl,

731
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,520
but she's a big girl now

732
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,429
I found that

733
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,600
she

734
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,320
did change a lot.

735
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,489
She is grown up.

736
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,230
Yes.

737
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,520
You're all grown up

738
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,320
but we're old.

739
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,040
Time passes so quickly that

740
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,710
you're all old enough

741
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,120
to get married.

742
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,470
You and my dad are still young.

743
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,280
Yes. We're young,

744
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,890
so we can help you with your kids in the future.

745
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,390
Mr. Li,

746
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,870
you and my dad

747
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,950
can remarry.

748
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,840
I don't know what your dad thinks about it.

749
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I…

750
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,360
Forget it.

751
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,130
It's great to be alone.

752
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,720
Let's talk something else.

753
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,470
You didn’t get a girlfriend

754
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,620
when you were abroad these years?

755
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,710
No.

756
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,540
I was too busy to study,

757
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
let alone have a girlfriend.

758
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,840
Yes.

759
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,230
You needed to…

760
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,130
That's all.

761
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,710
It's great that you're back.

762
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,360
Girls here are also great.

763
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,840
They are beautiful and sensible.

764
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,320
Right?

765
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,230
I agree.

766
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,520
Well.

767
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,470
OK.

768
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,840
Prepare to go to bed.

769
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,910
Mr. Li.

770
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,320
Yes?

771
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,870
Can I have a look at Jianjian's room?

772
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,150
OK.

773
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,320
Do as you like.

774
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,080
I'll go to bed.

775
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,390
OK.

776
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,080
♫Rainwater chases me into the window♫

777
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,040
♫I'm wet and heartbroken♫

778
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,950
♫The water keeps flowing without restraint♫

779
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,470

783

784

♫let me become a sea♫

785
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,730
Your dad is back.

786
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,840
Hello, dad.

787
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,760
Hello.

788
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,910
Ling Xiao,

789
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,150
did you sleep well

790
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,150
last night?

791
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,360
Yes.

792
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,070
Did you work late last night?

793
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,390
Yeah.

794
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,670
It was about eleven o'clock

795
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,400
after the dispute was settled.

796
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,120
It was troublesome

797
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,630
for me to come back,

798
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,160
so I slept in the station.

799
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,040
I was confused when I just came in

800
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,980
and remembered their childhood.

801
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,630
At that time, we had breakfast

802
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,300
as lively as fighting.

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,060
Well, here you are.

804
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,360
Yes.

805
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,330
Jianjian always lingered in bed,

806
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,950
but

807
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,800
when she was going to late,

808
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,000
she was so anxious.

809
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,670
Ziqiu was great.

810
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,950
He got up early

811
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,010
and helped with doing breakfast.

812
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,820
Do you still remember?

813
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,720
There was

814
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,690
always a stick here.

815
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,280
Bang bang bang.

816
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,760
Ziqiu's idea.

817
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,800
Now

818
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,470
I always think the knocking on the ceiling

819
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,200
is a signal for me to have a meal.

820
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,640
Ling Xiao,

821
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,430
you

822
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
need to stay here with Mr. Li

823
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,630
for several more days.

824
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,360
I haven't cleaned up your room.

825
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
I'll paste new wallpaper

826
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,390
and change

827
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,910
bed pad

828
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,350
and air conditioner.

829
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,810
No need, dad.

830
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,360
I'm going to move out.

831
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,080
What?

832
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,470
Where, where

833
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,390
are you going to move?

834
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,280
He told me.

835
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,840
He'll live in a house

836
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,970
facing Jianjian's.

837
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,120
Well.

838
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,230
He wants to live near

839
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,190
his friends for fun after coming back.

840
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,520
Well.

841
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,720
Just move.

842
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,430
OK.

843
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,080
Well, enjoy the breakfast.

844
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,910
I'll go to

845
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,840
the restaurant.

846
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,670
You don't eat?

847
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,240
I did when it was just ready.

848
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,120
He loves you so much that

849
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,250
he prepared crabs for your breakfast.

850
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,320
See you.

851
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,040
See you.

852
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,200
When, when will you move?

853
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,950
A few days later.

854
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,520
I need to clean up

855
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,630
the house first.

856
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,150
I'll help you.

857
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,800
Don't bother. I can do it by myself.

858
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,660
Alright. Enjoy it.

859
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,950
When

860
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,230
will you report to the hospital?

861
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
I'll begin to work

862
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
after reporting today.

863
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,320
You go today?

864
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,650
Play for a few more days.

865
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,670
I was informed to work since the 13th day this month,

866
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,390
but I couldn't decide the time.

867
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,520
I was late for a week.

868
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,280
Never mind.

869
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,080
As I come back,

870
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,630
I have more time to later.

871
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,670
Yes.

872
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,840
Enjoy the crabs.

873
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,840
OK.

874
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,150
Enjoy it.

875
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,120
I don't like crabs.

876
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,320
Mr. Li specially prepared them for you.

877
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,080
Hello, Miss.

878
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,950
Your teeth are sensitive

879
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,150
after tooth extraction.

880
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,430
It is recommended

881
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,120
to switch to Usmile to gentle mode

882
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,320
when brushing teeth.

883
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,870
If you feel sore gums,

884
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,600
please switch

885
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,670
to massage mode

886
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,040
to massage you gum,

887
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,810
so as to alleviate sensitivity and discomfort.

888
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,390
Thanks.

889
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,240
I want to go to the toilet.

890
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,360
Let' go.

891
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,000
I can go by myself.

892
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,700
It's fine for me to go with you.

893
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,390
No need.

894
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,710
We shouldn't go to

895
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,510
the toilet together at this age.

896
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
You're occupied, right?

897
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,230
In fact…

898
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm fine.

899
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,770
Li Jianjian,

900
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
come to Room No. 5.

901
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,630
Go.

902
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,600
Coming.

903
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,800
You want to run away.

904
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,910
Come back.

905
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,390
Qi Mingyue, let me go.

906
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm not going. I'm not.

907
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,710
Hurry up.

908
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,390
Don't force me.

909
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,150
Go in.

910
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,910
Sorry, doctor.

911
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,320
Come and lie down.
