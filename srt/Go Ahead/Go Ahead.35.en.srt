00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,020
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,860
Episode 35

4
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
But this bridge is just inconvenient for me.

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
As you can see,

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,080
this 3-room house with the area of 140 square meters

7
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
is north-facing,

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,720
and it’s newly-decorated for a newly married couple

9
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,800
who didn’t live here for long.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,920
So this house

11
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,320
is really a great choice.

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
But it is too big

13
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,920
and not many people want such a big house,

14
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,520
but I think it's just right for you

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,240
to live in.

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
The house is nice,

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,600
but it's better

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
if the rent is much lower.

19
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,920
Later I'll discuss it with the landlord

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,880
to see if they can lower the rent

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
if you can pay it annually.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,160
OK, that's great.

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,440
Thank you.

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,079
You're welcome.

25
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,200
OK, goodbye.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,160
See you.

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,280
OK.

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
This house is excellent.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Indeed, it is big enough.

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,800
When your brother comes to live with us,

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
there's enough room for him too.

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Well, you can live here yourself.

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,640
I'll return to Singapore on the weekend.

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,200
Now that your brother and I are here,

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
why do you return to Singapore yourself?

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,120
Then I'll go to Malaysia

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,650
to be with my grandparents.

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,280
Cut it out, OK?

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,650
Besides, I've been used to living here

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,000
since I was little.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,520
This is my home.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,260
What's wrong with you?

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
We've agreed

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,480
to come back to celebrate Ling Xiao's birthday

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,360
and sweep the tomb of my grandmother,

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
but why did you decide

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,180
to settle down here

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,000
after discussing it with uncle?

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,760
I just think

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,920
it is well developed here,

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
and it’s convenient to live here.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
Besides, you like this place,

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,480
don't you?

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
You were happy

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,100
to go fishing with your uncle, right?

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,280
You miss your brother a lot too, right?

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,400
I don't!

58
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,160
Can't you see

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
that he doesn’t want us here?

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
No.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,650
You are yelling at me again.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,120
I want to come back home, so what?

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
What’s wrong with it?

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,440
I want to stay with my family.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,000
So what?

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,520
And you

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,720
yell at me

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,620
and get angry with me all the time.

69
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,480
If we return to Singapore,

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,200
I have to tolerate it every day.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,280
I deserve

72
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
to be alone in Singapore?

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,640
In fact, I didn’t plan this.

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,320
After all,

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,920
I'm already used to the life

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
in Singapore.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
However, what your uncle said

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,159
does make sense.

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,159
As you are in China,

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
you will have to fly to Singapore

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,840
if something happens to me

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,320
when I'm old.

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,600
So I'd rather return to China now.

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,840
Indeed that's right.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
You can come back.

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
However, Chengzi will be in her senior year in high school

87
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,120
after this summer holiday,

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,680
and she will take the college entrance exam next year.

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,600
The education in Singapore

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
is different from that in China,

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,080
and she cannot transfer to a school here either.

92
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
There will be a great impact on her.

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
If you want to live here,

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
what’s she supposed to do?

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,840
So this is what you worry about?

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,400
I've already thought about it.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,120
Since she's on summer holiday now,

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,320
we'll be back to Singapore

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,450
when school starts.

100
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,920
Once the winter holiday arrives, we'll come here again.

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,760
And we'll be back to Singapore before school starts again.

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,800
As taking a plane is so convenient now,

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,920
It’ll take only a short time to go to and fro.

104
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,160
After taking the college entrance exam,

105
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,040
Chengzi can

106
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,940
apply for a domestic university.

107
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
There are a lot of excellent universities in China.

108
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,440
By then,

109
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
we'll move back completely

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
after I sell the house in Singapore.

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,040
It’ll take only a year.

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,960
You can move back

113
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,560
after Chengzi takes the college entrance examination.

114
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
You don't have to go travel back and forth.

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,159
It doesn’t matter,

116
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,220
Chengzi won't cause you any trouble.

117
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
Actually,

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
I just want to live somewhere close to you

119
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,920
so that I can often see you

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,880
and take care of you.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
We are family,

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,250
so we should live together.

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
Children

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,720
are the main concern of their parents.

125
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll go back to Singapore on this weekend, anyway.

126
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
OK.

127
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,010
You can live wherever you want,

128
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,520
but you shouldn't come back

129
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
until Chengzi takes her college entrance exam.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like you said,

131
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,880
children

132
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,010
are the main concern of their parents.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,080
Don't worry,

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,000
I won't cause you any trouble.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,320
You made up your mind

136
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,920
when I came back from Singapore

137
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
the last time, right?

138
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,760
Chengzi told me

139
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,320
that you bought a lot of things

140
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,050
and went to visit your friends.

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,250
So you were saying goodbye?

142
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,720
You asked me

143
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,760
to hang out with my friends, didn't you?

144
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
You told me

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
to go shopping, have some coffee

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,080
and go out in the sun.

147
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Anyway you don't believe

148
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,500
in whatever I tell you.

149
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,920
Yeah, it's my fault.

150
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,480
It's my fault.

151
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,440
I have bad luck.

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,120
I didn't even meet my mom for the last time

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
before she passed away.

154
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,440
I had a car accident

155
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
and lost my husband,

156
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,600
and I became what I'm right now.

157
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,130
I'm a burden to my children.

158
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,760
No wonder you despise me.

159
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Who despises you?

160
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Stop pretending to be pathetic!

161
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Chengzi!

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,960
This is

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,020
what you think too!

164
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,000
How hypocritical!

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Shut up!

166
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
Can't I even tell the truth?

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
You don’t let me tell the truth just because you don’t?

168
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,460
What brought you back, Jianjian?

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,000
Since

170
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,600
Ms. Chen Ting and Chengzi

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,360
are going back to Singapore soon,

172
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,800
I bought some local specialties.

173
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,960
But they were delivered to my studio

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,720
by mistake,

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,250
so I carried them back here.

176
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,159
I'm leaving.

177
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,520
You’re sweating.

178
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm going back to the hotel.

179
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
Mom!

180
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,100
Are you coming with me?

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,730
Then you just stay here.

182
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,980
I've made up my mind to come back to China.

183
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,570
If you don’t want

184
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
to see me,

185
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
it’s up to you.

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,800
Xiao?

187
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,580
Your mom and you sister have left?

188
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,120
I'm in a sweat. What happened?

189
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,280
What happened?

190
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Do you want me to hold you like a baby?

191
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,920
My mom wants to rent a house

192
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,520
in our residential quarter.

193
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,740
She wants to settle down here.

194
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
I didn’t see that coming.

195
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,850
She must have made up her mind long ago.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,520
So be it.

197
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,240
She can live

198
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
wherever she wants.

199
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,480
Besides,

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
It’s her hometown here,

201
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,880
and now you are back too.

202
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,840
But what about Chengzi?

203
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,140
She has to go to school.

204
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Chengzi, your brother is cooking.

205
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,740
I've made a glass of orange juice for you.

206
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
Chengzi?

207
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm back.

208
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Welcome back.

209
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,600
Get a bowl of rice for Mingyue, Jianjian.

210
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,280
OK.

211
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,640
No, thanks, I have no appetite.

212
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,600
Why?

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
You don’t feel well?

214
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,040
No.

215
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,020
My mom blacklisted my mobile number,

216
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,960
and my dad didn't answer my call.

217
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,440
I know that my mom

218
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,840
didn't allow him to do so.

219
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Would you like to go back home?

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,660
Forget it. I’ll give them some time to calm down.

221
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,820
I'm going to take a shower.

222
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,280
All of you are poor

223
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
and unfortunate.

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Xiao,

225
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,360
call Chengzi.

226
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
Has she got back to the hotel?

227
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,610
I called her, but she didn't answer it.

228
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Leave her alone.

229
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes,

230
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
being at this age,

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
she's right in the middle of her rebellious period

232
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,200
and she’s against the whole world.

233
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,530
We have experienced it.

234
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
Remember?

235
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,400
I always

236
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,440
went to the internet bar to play games.

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,680
Snacks were forbidden in the class,

238
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,320
but I insisted on bring them.

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
I always did the opposite

240
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,120
of what the teachers said.

241
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,650
Exactly.

242
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
At that time,

243
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,440
I got changed immediately after school.

244
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,680
I thought that the school uniform

245
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,000
was too ugly.

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, you were like a punk.

247
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
I just pretended to be.

248
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,000
The children nowadays

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,240
are much difficult than what we used to be.

250
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,000
They do short videos.

251
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,840
They just need more homework.

252
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,160
Indeed.

253
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
The children nowadays

254
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,320
could play with iPads at the age of two.

255
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,080
They have their own minds

256
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,360
very early.

257
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
Why are you

258
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
sitting here?

259
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,340
Watch out for the bad guys.

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,600
Go home.

261
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,640
What are you doing?

262
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,320
What are you doing?

263
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,400
Pal?

264
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,680
Pal,

265
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,240
are you OK?

266
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,160
Do you need me

267
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,840
to get a taxi for you?

268
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,440
No.

269
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
Thank you. Thank you.

270
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Someone will pick me up.

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
You don't need my help, right?

272
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,160
Thank you.

273
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,600
Thank you.

274
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,080
OK.

275
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,440
What's the matter?

276
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,800
It's already 10 p.m.

277
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,770
The hotel is right here.

278
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
Why don't you go back?

279
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,920
I had a quarrel with my mom.

280
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
She keeps all of my certificates,

281
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,080
so I can't book a room.

282
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,720
You see,

283
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,160
if I hadn’t

284
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,840
passed by after work,

285
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
are you going to sit here all night long?

286
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,320
Does your brother know this?

287
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Hello, Ling Xiao.

288
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,720
I’ve got your sister in my hands.

289
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Gosh! She's eating my...

290
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Forget it, forget it.

291
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,840
My fish...

292
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,720
She feeds too much!

293
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,380
Is she going to stay here tonight?

294
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,570
She will stay in my room.

295
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
This girl looks

296
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,360
hard to deal with.

297
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,040
But we can't kick her out.

298
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
Ziqiu brought her back.

299
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,840
Tonight let's go washing ourselves

300
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
in Tang Can's bedroom,

301
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,840
and leave her

302
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,140
the bathroom outside.

303
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,800
Well, go washing yourself first, Tang Can.

304
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,480
I have to change the water

305
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
in my fishbowl,

306
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,650
otherwise the fishes will die from overfeeding.

307
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Let's change the sheets and quilt cover.

308
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,520
I'll sleep with Mingyue tonight.

309
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,080
Sleep with me tonight.

310
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,240
No.

311
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,320
What’s wrong?

312
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,580
What are you thinking?

313
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,560
If the two of you

314
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
sleep together tonight,

315
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll call my dad

316
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,960
and tell him about this.

317
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,440
Ling Xiao is kidding.

318
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,320
Can't you tell?

319
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,040
Don't call dad

320
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,370
and tell him about this.

321
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,700
Let's go and change the sheets, Xiao.

322
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,170
Just change the sheets.

323
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
This is a charger,

324
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,280
and this is

325
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,160
my old iPad.

326
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,240
You can watch some shows when you feel bored.

327
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,320
Your old iPad?

328
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
Sure.

329
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
I won’t lend

330
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,520
my new iPad to you.

331
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,800
How stingy!

332
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,480
Since you have nowhere to go,

333
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,760
watch your attitude.

334
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,160
You are a teenager,

335
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,740
but you are not cute at all.

336
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,480
Yeah, Li Jianjian is the cutest.

337
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,240
Exactly,

338
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,440
Li Jianjian is the cutest in our family.

339
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
I think she's annoying.

340
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,960
Besides, she must have slept

341
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
with my brother.

342
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,000
What's in your mind

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,880
as a teenager?

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,860
I'll hit you if you say that again.

345
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
Help yourself, Chengzi.

346
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,610
Just make yourself at home.

347
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,760
You rotten kid, reply to her!

348
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,680
Thank you.

349
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
You're welcome.

350
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,360
All right, rest early.

351
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,109
Ling Xiao,

352
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,589
get out quickly

353
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,880
once the sheets are changed!

354
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,760
If I don't see you

355
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,040
in your bedroom tonight,

356
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,569
there’ll be consequences.

357
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Don't take Chengzi's attitude

358
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,589
personally.

359
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,829
I won't.

360
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,800
As an adult,

361
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
I won’t take what a teenager says seriously.

362
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Whatever she says,

363
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,680
I'll just take it as meows.

364
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,010
I didn't teach her well.

365
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,560
I think she's similar to you

366
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,490
in some aspects.

367
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,060
Well, I'll just love you and your sister.

368
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,680
All right,

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,920
pull the two corners.

370
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,400
Come on.

371
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,440
OK.

372
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,080
When will you go back?

373
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,020
I won't go back.

374
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I'll be staying here till the weekend

375
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,860
and then return to Singapore.

376
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
I wish you a nice trip.

377
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
Don’t forget to take the Xiamen Specialties

378
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
I bought you.

379
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,400
No way.

380
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,170
They are cheap, anyway.

381
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,160
I've refunded your tickets

382
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,220
back to Singapore.

383
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,480
Since Mom won't go back,

384
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,040
I can’t let you go back alone.

385
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,560
Just stay here for the summer vacation.

386
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,120
Why did you refund my flight ticket?

387
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,080
I have to go back.

388
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,040
Since you don’t want me here,

389
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,640
why should I still stay here?

390
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
So you know you’re annoying.

391
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
I've told Mom that you’ll stay here with us.

392
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,890
Today you just stay at home.

393
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,640
If you are hungry, just order some take-out.

394
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
Let’s talk about it when we get back.

395
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,320
I don't want to stay here.

396
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,920
It’s boring.

397
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Cut it out, OK?

398
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm going to work.

399
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,640
Just go ahead,

400
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,700
and leave me alone.

401
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,480
How about this?

402
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,120
Go with me

403
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,400
to my wood carving studio.

404
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,730
It’s located by the sea.

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,460
I don't want to go with you.

406
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,720
Lucky me!

407
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,370
Well, I've got to go.

408
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm going with him.

409
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm going to his coffee shop.

410
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,320
You are going with me?

411
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,360
Yes, with you.

412
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,480
Wait a second, I'll get changed.

413
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,160
Wait for me, keep still.

414
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
I really don't know how to take care of a teenager.

415
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,080
Thank you.

416
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,120
You’re lucky that she likes you.

417
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Good luck, Ziqiu.

418
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Let's go, Xiao.

419
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,160
OK, thanks.

420
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,560
Please enjoy.

421
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,010
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

422
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,860
Never mind.

423
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,000
I ordered a latte for you,

424
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,460
but I wonder if you like it.

425
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,440
So kind of you, whatever is OK.

426
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Here, take a seat.

427
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,560
What’s up?

428
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,760
I heard that you want to rent a house.

429
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,010
So you want to settle down here?

430
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,840
Yes, so?

431
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,960
You didn't tell me about this

432
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,440
on Ling Xiao's birthday.

433
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,880
Why do you want

434
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,760
to settle down here suddenly?

435
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,720
Since we've been divorced

436
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
for so long,

437
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
I don't have to

438
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,280
report everything to you, right?

439
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,340
I didn't mean that.

440
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,920
Of course,

441
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,960
we are not married anymore,

442
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
but our son is still related

443
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,880
to both of us, right?

444
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
I did this for my son.

445
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,840
He wants to settle down here,

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,280
and I should support him anyway.

447
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,320
So, since he's back, I'll be back too.

448
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,880
You did this for our son, right?

449
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
Well, I got it.

450
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,440
If you say so,

451
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,360
I'd like to be honest

452
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,560
with you.

453
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,210
Ling Xiao has been taking care of you these years,

454
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,410
and I think you know better than I do

455
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,960
about how hard he has worked

456
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,020
and how difficult it has been for him.

457
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,800
In your situation,

458
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,640
I understand

459
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,180
that you need Ling Xiao

460
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,160
to take care of you,

461
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,560
and I don't have a problem with it.

462
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,690
However, I have to tell you something.

463
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,530
Ling Xiao is suffering from

464
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
a very serious mental disease right now.

465
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,080
He can't sleep well every night.

466
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,160
He takes a lot of medicine

467
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,490
for treating insomnia.

468
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,380
And he has to fight against

469
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,100
both anxiety and depression.

470
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,440
Fortunately, he has Li Jianjian with him.

471
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Ling Xiao likes Li Jianjian a lot.

472
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,280
After they got together,

473
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,080
Ling Xiao got better,

474
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,780
and he sleeps much better.

475
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,600
Now I've found a traditional Chinese medicine doctor

476
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,160
to help improve his health.

477
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,400
So...

478
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,120
Chen Ting?

479
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
Don't tell me

480
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,170
that you know nothing about Ling Xiao's disease.

481
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,920
Of course I know.

482
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,600
But he's always

483
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,160
a little introverted,

484
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,920
and he always keeps everything to himself.

485
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,120
But he has become better

486
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,320
after coming back.

487
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,780
Good since you know it.

488
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,080
As his parents,

489
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,400
he should be our priority.

490
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,600
I can see

491
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,960
that you don’t like Li Jianjian,

492
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,040
but I can tell you

493
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,400
that Ling Xiao

494
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,600
loves Li Jianjian very much.

495
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,460
For the sake of our son,

496
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
I think you should

497
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,960
try to like Li Jianjian.

498
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,500
It's not that I don’t like her.

499
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I’m just

500
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,160
not familiar with her

501
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,760
because it’s been a long time since we last met

502
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,800
and I don’t know what to say to her.

503
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,960
I think you must have misunderstood me.

504
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,820
All right, that would be the best.

505
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,120
No offense.

506
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,600
I know

507
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm not a qualified father.

508
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,560
To be honest with you,

509
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,680
Haichao is really

510
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
a much better father than I am.

511
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
He’s always so patient

512
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,520
with the kids.

513
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,920
It suddenly occurs to me

514
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,120
that when they were little,

515
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
my head ached

516
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,720
when they played

517
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,480
and jumped around me.

518
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,360
Dad.

519
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,440
Any patient right now?

520
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,960
No, not at the moment.

521
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,160
Well, check it for me.

522
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,040
My gums ache.

523
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,200
Let me see.

524
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,040
Here.

525
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
Do I have excessive internal heat?

526
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,900
I can't see any inflammation.

527
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,680
I'll give you a careful checkup

528
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,940
at the treatment room.

529
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,120
Get a room for me.

530
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,040
No need.

531
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Don't bother.

532
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
My gum started aching

533
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,920
after I got up in the morning.

534
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,240
I might have some excessive internal heat.

535
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,800
Well,

536
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,880
just prescribe some bezoar antidotal tablets

537
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,560
for me.

538
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,160
Since you can give

539
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,240
yourself a prescription,

540
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,880
why did you come to see the dentist?

541
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
I just wanted you to have a look at it.

542
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,320
It's fine.

543
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,080
You might have an inflammation.

544
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,360
You don’t need to take medicine. Just drink more water.

545
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
OK, I'll listen to you.

546
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,920
No medicine and more water.

547
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,320
So, what...

548
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,880
Dad,

549
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
do you have a moment right now?

550
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,560
Yes.

551
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
Let's go have lunch.

552
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,560
Sure,

553
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,680
I'll call the office to tell them

554
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,940
I would be there later.

555
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,920
What would you like to have?

556
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
It’s on me.

557
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,200
Let's just have something nearby.

558
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,720
Fine.

559
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
I'll go get changed first.

560
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,680
Go ahead.

561
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,960
Go.

562
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
Have more meat.

563
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,880
Eating only vegetables is bad for you, OK?

564
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,740
You see, you've lost more weight.

565
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,880
Well, Jianjian told me

566
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,810
that your mom is going to move back.

567
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,320
She told you already?

568
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,600
Last night,

569
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,840
she called her dad

570
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,970
and I was just there.

571
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,300
So she told me about it.

572
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,760
Ling Xiao,

573
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,920
I think

574
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,440
it's good for your mom to come back.

575
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,520
If anything

576
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,120
went wrong with her,

577
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,720
you would have to

578
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,960
go to Singapore, right?

579
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,080
Now that she's moving back,

580
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,360
with relatives around taking care of her,

581
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
it’ll be easier for you.

582
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,240
Don't care about your mom's opinion

583
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,800
on the relationship between Jianjian and you.

584
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,060
The in-law relationship is the hardest.

585
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
Even if you marry a princess,

586
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,460
she’ll think that she’s not good enough for you.

587
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,160
She told me

588
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,080
she was unfamiliar with Jianjian,

589
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
so she didn’t know what to say to her.

590
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,010
She didn't mean anything else.

591
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,960
Dad.

592
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,380
You went to see her?

593
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,960
No. Why would I do that?

594
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,440
I just called

595
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,320
and asked her

596
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,440
if she needs me to help her move.

597
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
And I asked her

598
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,960
about Jianjian and you, by the way.

599
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,220
That's why she told me about it like that.

600
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,240
Dad.

601
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,320
Thank you.

602
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,160
Ling Xiao,

603
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,240
I used to...

604
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,920
Dad.

605
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
When I was in fourth grade,

606
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
I wrote an essay

607
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,220
about "My Dad".

608
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,640
Do you still remember it?

609
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,160
Of course I remember it.

610
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,100
You wrote about Mr. Li.

611
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't mention this to me.

612
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm still annoyed.

613
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,010
Actually I wrote about you.

614
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Really?

615
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
I wrote about you

616
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,260
at the very beginning.

617
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,040
Then,

618
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,320
my teacher asked me to bring it back home

619
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,520
and let you sign on it,

620
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,180
so I wrote another one.

621
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,730
Did you complain about me in it,

622
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
so you dare not show it to me?

623
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
No.

624
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,960
I wrote

625
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
that my dad is a policeman

626
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,920
who gets rid of the wicked

627
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,200
and protects the civilians outside.

628
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,660
He's particularly great.

629
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,100
In fact, I admired you a lot

630
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,120
when I was little,

631
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,440
so I was too embarrassed

632
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,640
to show you the essay.

633
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
I wrote about Mr. Li,

634
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,840
because it would make him happy

635
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,570
and then he would make more delicious food for me.

636
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
What a foodie you are!

637
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,240
All right, eat some meat.

638
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,440
Ling Xiao,

639
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,280
do you still have that essay?

640
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,360
Show it to me.

641
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I don’t have it anymore.

642
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,680
No, you must have kept it.

643
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,240
Show it to me.

644
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
One more mango juice.

645
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
So this is how you talk to others?

646
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
A mango juice.

647
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,360
OK.

648
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,120
Don’t.

649
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,600
Why?

650
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm the boss,

651
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,160
so I can do whatever I want here.

652
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,490
And you were being rude.

653
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,520
Don't even give her a glass of water

654
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,080
unless she learns how to be polite.

655
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
I don’t want to be here anyway!

656
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm leaving.

657
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,730
OK, then I'll call your brother

658
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,440
and tell him

659
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,320
that you leave on your own.

660
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
And I'll ask him to look for you.

661
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,060
So happy with that?

662
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
Are you crazy?

663
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,560
Why would you do that?

664
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,520
I took you out,

665
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,060
and I have to take you back.

666
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
If you hadn’t come out with me,

667
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,600
you can go wherever you want

668
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,680
and it has nothing to do with me,

669
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
OK?

670
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,220
Apologize.

671
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,160
I'm sorry.

672
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,120
To whom?

673
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,840
Ziqiu.

674
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,420
Go watch your play.

675
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Make a glass of mango juice for my little sister.

676
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,080
OK.

677
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll pay.

678
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
It's not for sale.

679
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,740
Do you think

680
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I can’t handle a little kid like you?

681
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,180
Hello, here's your Espresso.

682
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,840
Welcome.

683
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,880
I was around here, so I came to see you.

684
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,570
Am I disturbing you?

685
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,000
No.

686
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,080
Where is Dongdong?

687
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,960
I got him into another kindergarten.

688
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,320
Your dad helped.

689
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,840
He's already there.

690
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,360
Is he

691
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,010
mentally retarded?

692
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,240
No. It's psychological.

693
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,560
When his father

694
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,800
beat his mother,

695
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,280
if he cried or talked,

696
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,170
his father would scold him.

697
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Poor boy.

698
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,000
Yes.

699
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,280
His mother too.

700
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,120
But it's OK.

701
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
She will come here

702
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,960
in a few months.

703
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,800
Dongdong will get better.

704
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,640
I've watched the video.

705
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,520
Yesterday you took Dongdong

706
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,800
to my dad's noodle restaurant to have noodles.

707
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,080
Miss Zhu thought my dad

708
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,480
is still in love with you.

709
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,240
I mean,

710
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,560
actually

711
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,000
a lot of people think

712
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that my dad is still in love with you.

713
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
Wait a minute.

714
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,360
I packed it.

715
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,960
Give it to Dongdong.

716
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
Thank you

717
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,660
on behalf of Dongdong.

718
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,770
You’re welcome.

719
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,560
Then I'll go back to work.

720
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Ziqiu.

721
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,760
I raised Ziqiu.

722
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
And I know him very well.

723
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,600
Dad, I'm back.

724
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,960
Hey, Jianjian. Come to eat.

725
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,080
Hi, Jianjian.

726
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,240
Miss Zhu.

727
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,960
What brought you back home

728
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
for dinner suddenly?

729
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,160
Mr. Ling said he wanted to talk with me.

730
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,880
Don't keep

731
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
looking at the screen.

732
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,360
Your eyes will dry if you look at it for too long.

733
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,200
If you want to send messages on WeChat,

734
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,240
use voice message.

735
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,840
Fine.

736
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,080
Who are you talking to?

737
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,320
Well,

738
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
just an old neighbor.

739
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,640
Oh?

740
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,760
It's not Miss Zhang?

741
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,600
No.

742
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,040
Then,

743
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,200
Ms. He Mei?

744
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,600
No!

745
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,400
Then it’s Ms. He Mei.

746
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,120
Seriously, no.

747
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,480
Alright!

748
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,200
I believe you.

749
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Anyway, you're at this age already.

750
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,320
I shouldn't talk too much about it.

751
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
If you want marry again,

752
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,800
I totally agree.

753
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,880
But you should be careful.

754
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,560
Don't fall into the same pit.

755
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,120
Right?

756
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,040
If you want someone pretty, no problem.

757
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,720
But

758
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
you can't live

759
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,480
with someone who is only pretty.

760
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,520
Look at you!

761
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,680
I knew you'd misunderstand it.

762
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,320
I talk to He Mei for the sake of Ziqiu only.

763
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,800
You don't have to explain it to me.

764
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,520
I'm not trying to stop you.

765
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,890
I have no problem whoever you love.

766
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,480
But just be careful.

767
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
If it doesn't work,

768
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,800
don't let it affect

769
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,840
me and Ziqiu.

770
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,840
OK. Noted.

771
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,080
Noted. Cut it out.

772
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,960
You’re getting impatient now?

773
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,680
You have to keep that in mind, Mr. Li.

774
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,400
Am I your dad,

775
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,640
or are you my dad?

776
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,880
Dad, you are my dad.

777
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,960
OK.

778
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,200
Have I ever nagged you

779
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,930
when you chose your boyfriend?

780
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,400
What?

781
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,160
Now while I'm chatting

782
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,960
with my friend,

783
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,280
you start to nag me?

784
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,360
"Friend"!

785
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,570
And you called her "my friend"!

786
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,840
Oh my goodness, Mr. Li!

787
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,040
-Oh sweet heavens! -Please!

788
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,760
What's the fun here?

789
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,160
It's about his "friend"!

790
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,100
Just eat! Is my food so tasteless?

791
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,880
OK.

792
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,320
What "friend"?

793
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,160
It's none of your business.

794
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,150
Have you eaten?

795
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,810
I ate in the police station.

796
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,670
Have you?

797
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,670
Yes.

798
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,520
If you have, do you need to prepare the dishes?

799
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,320
Don’t you have to do business tomorrow?

800
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,920
Can’t I

801
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,440
spend some time with my daughter before I do that?

802
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,080
I'll do that for you.

803
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,600
You prepare the dishes.

804
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,969
And think about your "friend" by the way.

805
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,040
Come on. Look at that.

806
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,080
How can you guys

807
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,190
be so gossipy?

808
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,590
Just go and do your thing.

809
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm just texting someone on WeChat.

810
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,150
You know?

811
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,760
You...

812
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,920
Prepare your dishes.

813
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,400
He is so wordy.

814
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,040
What "friend"?

815
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,360
You want to know her?

816
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,100
Keeping secrets for your dad!

817
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,800
Why did you send my dad away?

818
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Well...

819
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,040
I went to talk to Ling Xiao's mother today.

820
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,080
Why did you talk to Ms. Chen Ting?

821
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,200
I could tell it

822
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,520
on Ling Xiao's birthday

823
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,160
that she and Ling Xiao's sister

824
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,640
weren't nice to you.

825
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,840
As carefree

826
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,240
as you are,

827
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,520
I know you saw that.

828
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,680
You're upset, right?

829
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm fine.

830
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,920
We don't have to

831
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,840
face each other every day anyway.

832
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,600
It's alright.

833
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
Alright?

834
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,460
When she was in Singapore,

835
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,640
things were easier.

836
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,160
Now she will move back

837
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
and she wants to live

838
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,040
in the same residential quarter with you.

839
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,370
She’s did it on purpose.

840
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,760
Jianjian,

841
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,560
as you know, the most difficult thing in the world

842
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,690
is the relationship

843
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,960
between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

844
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
If she dares to bully you in the future,

845
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,260
you can tell me.

846
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
I will protect you

847
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,010
and give her a hard time.

848
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm going to talk to your dad about his "friend."

849
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,520
His "friend"!

850
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,920
Ling Xiao?

851
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,920
You came to pick me up?

852
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,640
Dad said you were

853
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
taking a bus today,

854
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,970
so I waited for you here.

855
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,600
I want to have some ice cream.

856
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,400
No, it's too late today.

857
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,120
Please.

858
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,120
Acting cute isn’t going to work.

859
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,800
I'll be on the evening shift tomorrow.

860
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
So I'll take you to the studio in the morning

861
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
and buy it for you.

862
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,800
If Ziqiu were here,

863
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,040
he would buy me one.

864
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,760
But he's not here.

865
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,800
Let's go.

866
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,640
Did you

867
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,970
call your mother today?

868
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,080
No.

869
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,840
But my aunt

870
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,760
called me.

871
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,480
She said that she had come here.

872
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
In these days,

873
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,880
she'll accompany my mother

874
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
to buy some furniture and so on.

875
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,610
She told me not to worry.

876
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,320
In fact,

877
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,720
you can make a call to her.

878
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Don't fight for too long.

879
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,490
We’re not in a fight.

880
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,380
A fight of silence is even more terrible.

881
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,720
I don't mean a fight of silence with her.

882
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,960
I just

883
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
feel powerless.

884
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,360
I don't know how to communicate with her

885
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,880
or what to say.

886
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,480
It's like

887
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,600
dealing with a black hole.

888
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,040
No matter

889
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,280
what you fill in it,

890
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,730
you can't fill it up.

891
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,060
No matter what you say,

892
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,720
it doesn't reply.

893
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,680
I understand how you feel.

894
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,640
A black hole will be a black hole.

895
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,640
But

896
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,960
what if

897
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,720
this black hole doesn't want to be

898
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,520
a black hole?

899
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
Or it doesn't even know

900
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,080
it's a black hole?

901
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,650
You’re always positive about things.

902
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,480
You think that’s positive?

903
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,320
A black hole is a black hole,

904
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,440
because the essence of black holes

905
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,400
is to devour,

906
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,880
smashing things close to them,

907
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
making things a part of themselves.

908
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
There's too much darkness.

909
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,120
Have you been feeling anxious recently?

910
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,080
Do you take your medicine regularly?

911
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,280
Yes.

912
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,450
But you are my medicine.

913
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,640
What medicine am I?

914
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,320
Like a pill of some sort?

915
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,760
You're making it into a chicken nest.

916
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,820
Why did you do that?

917
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
You refused to buy me ice cream,

918
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
and you tried to make my head a chicken nest!

919
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,400
Well, can you two hurry up?

920
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,240
Ziqiu!

921
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,280
OK!

922
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,720
You came here to pick me up too?

923
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,780
I came here for him.

924
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,160
Get your sister

925
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,040
away from me.

926
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,640
She's going to my coffee shop

927
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,720
with me again tomorrow.

928
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,600
Do I have to help your mother

929
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,860
babysit her every day?

930
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,720
Is she affecting your coffee shop business?

931
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
No.

932
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
But now you guys don't want her

933
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
to go back to Singapore.

934
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,920
She has no friends here

935
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,120
to spend the summer vacation with.

936
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,720
You should get something for her to do,

937
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,920
such as a training class or something,

938
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,480
right?

939
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,240
Isn't she going to take the college entrance examination next year?

940
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,040
You can send her

941
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,200
to a painting training class.

942
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,880
I don’t think

943
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,210
she does well in school.

944
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,760
Her school performance is quite good.

945
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,480
I’m sorry.

946
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,300
Stop laughing.

947
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,220
Figure something out.

948
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,120
I think,

949
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,600
if she wants to go, just let her.

950
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,280
She can't just sit there

951
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,160
in your place.

952
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,280
You can charge her

953
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,640
on whatever she eats or drinks.

954
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,800
I can’t do that.

955
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,120
She’s Ling Xiao's sister,

956
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,780
so she's kind of my sister too.

957
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,000
Then give her a discount.

958
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,900
Isn't she kind of your sister too?

959
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,080
Who wants her to be kind of my sister?

960
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,880
That’s awful!

961
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,280
Did you say that on purpose?

962
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,360
Don’t lower yourself to a kid.

963
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,000
Let go!

964
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,880
You're strangling me, He Ziqiu.

965
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,200
She took my remote!

966
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,240
Chengzi,

967
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,760
come with me.

968
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,860
What is that attitude?

969
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,720
She didn't even bother to say hi.

970
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,640
Will she leave tomorrow?

971
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,770
I don't think so.

972
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
My goodness!

973
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,720
My remote!

974
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,520
I was watching the series!

975
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,080
Where's my remote?
