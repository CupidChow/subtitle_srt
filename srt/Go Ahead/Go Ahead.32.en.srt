1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 32

4
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,320
Tang Can,

5
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,800
it's too windy here。

6
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,360
Let's talk inside.

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
I'll treat you to coffee.

8
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,240
No need.

9
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,370
I just passed by,

10
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,220
so I want to tell you in person.

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,100
I've quit the errand shop,

12
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,680
but

13
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
I'll run an errand

14
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,100
for your mother

15
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
as a favor,

16
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,260
so you don't have to pay me.

17
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
But please tell your mother

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,120
about it

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,100
and it'll be the last time.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,210
Why did you quit?

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,440
Because there's no reason to continue.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Besides,

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
my parents want me

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,880
to have a stable job.

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,920
Didn't you say

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
that parents just want their children

27
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,860
to be happy?

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
Then I'm leaving now.

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
I think you look good

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,060
and it's great.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,730
Mingyue has never been in a relationship before,

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,890
so she doesn't know how to deal with it.

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,680
She rejected you,

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,810
but it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm just saying

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
and that's it.

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,560
Thank you.

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
Hello, can I help you?

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
A glass of iced American-style coffee, please.

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,720
Any desserts?

41
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
No, thank you.

42
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,480
A glass of iced American-style coffee.

43
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,610
Hello, it's 42 yuan.

44
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,040
Here you are.

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,160
Love can't fill your stomach,

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
but sandwiches can.

47
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,360
Eat it.

48
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,480
Ziqiu,

49
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,290
what do you think Tang Can is doing?

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,200
Why does she want

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
a stable job suddenly?

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,210
She doesn't want to be an actress anymore.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,600
She went to audition yesterday

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
and the director asked her

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
to be the stand-in of the leading actress.

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
That's too much!

57
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,680
Different people have different choices.

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Eat it.

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
I think you're being selfish.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
She just took an order

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,520
from you

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
to play mahjong with your mother.

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Can't you ask someone else to do it?

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,960
I...

65
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
We're friends

66
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,500
and I worry about her, so what?

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
OK, fine.

68
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,560
It's time for me

69
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,820
to do my part-time job.

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,600
Your business has been better now,

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,560
so why do you still do the part-time job?

72
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
It's several thousand yuan a month

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,000
and I need the money.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,680
Don't you have more than a million yuan

75
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,600
in your bank account?

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
That's not my money.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
That's Zhao Huaguang's!

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,160
By the way,

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,160
midnight snack with me?

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,400
I think I have to write this all night long again.

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
We'll see.

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,530
I'll contact you later.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,370
I'm leaving.

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Hello.

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,159
Be careful.

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,960
Mom,

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,560
are your legs OK?

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
They're fine.

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,140
I've just been sitting a little bit too long.

90
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,000
What a nice day!

91
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,920
I think it's the same

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,850
as in Singapore.

93
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,400
You don't understand it.

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
It's my hometown,

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,570
so I think everything here is nice.

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm going to call my brother.

97
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
Don't.

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
Otherwise,

99
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,080
it won't be a birthday surprise.

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Let's go.

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
OK, five steps.

102
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,700
Five steps.

103
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,720
One, two...

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,800
Oh, my!

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,640
The restaurant deliberately uses a rare character,

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,159
but you thought it was a QR code.

107
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,480
You're so hilarious.

108
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,680
Don't tell Ziqiu about it.

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,440
Do you hear me?

110
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Stop it. Stop it.

111
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,760
This apartment is quite clean.

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,640
Do you live by yourself

113
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,080
or with someone else?

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,720
With Ziqiu.

115
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,520
The one who was adopted

116
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,480
by Li Haichao?

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
Didn't he go abroad to study?

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,010
He has come back.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
Li Jianjian lives opposite,

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
so you're kind of

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,530
living together again.

122
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,040
Why didn't you tell me

123
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,980
that you were coming back?

124
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,200
It was Chengzi.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,640
She wanted to surprise you on your birthday

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,500
and she didn't want me to tell you.

127
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
Besides, it's been a long time

128
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,659
since I came back last time

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,930
and I haven't seen your uncle in years.

130
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,580
It's a pity that I didn't come back

131
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,520
when your grandma passed away

132
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
and it's time for me to come back

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
and visit her tomb.

134
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,880
What?

135
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,120
Are you tired?

136
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,520
You look upset.

137
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
I think you're upset

138
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,490
after seeing me.

139
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
Watch your tone!

140
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,120
Didn't you say

141
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
that you want to see

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
where your brother lives and works?

143
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
And you said

144
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,560
that you want your brother

145
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
to take you out to play.

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,789
I didn't say that.

147
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't say that!

148
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,400
You surely did!

149
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
You miss your brother,

150
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,909
but why can't you be honest about it?

151
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't miss him,

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,030
because he doesn't miss me!

153
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,289
How could you say that?

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,680
Xiao,

155
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,600
I've prepare some fruits

156
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,360
for your mother and sister.

157
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
Let me take it.

158
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Is that Jianjian?

159
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,200
Aunty.

160
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
Come in, please.

161
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,760
No, thank you.

162
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,890
I'll leave you to it.

163
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,600
No.

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,400
Come in, please.

165
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,080
Come, Ling Xiao,

166
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
don't block the way

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
and let Jianjian inside.

168
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:12,920
Come.

169
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,650
Come in, please.

170
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,840
It's been so many years since I saw you last time.

171
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Now you've become a grown-up woman.

172
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,640
So pretty.

173
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,280
Ma'am, after so many years,

174
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,000
you haven't changed a little

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
and you look so young.

176
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
What a sweet talker!

177
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,760
Do you still remember Jianjian?

178
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,120
Do you remember

179
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
when you were little,

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Jianjian took you out to play

181
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,040
and you fell down the stairs

182
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,920
by accident?

183
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,920
No, I don't remember.

184
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
She was too little back then.

185
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,840
Yeah.

186
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
When you were little,

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,050
you fell down the stairs

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,180
but you blamed Li Jianjian for it.

189
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,610
I don't remember it.

190
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,120
She was a naughty girl back then, right?

191
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,760
Aunty,

192
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,160
where do you stay?

193
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,920
We'll stay at a hotel,

194
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,360
because I don't want to trouble Ling Xiao.

195
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,960
This time,

196
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,620
we came back for his birthday.

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,400
By then, I'll order a restaurant

198
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,720
and I'll invite Ling Xiao's father

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,080
and your father,

200
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,880
so we can celebrate it together.

201
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,760
OK.

202
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,680
OK.

203
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,960
You go back.

204
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Go back. You don't have to see me off.

205
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,600
Call me when you arrive at the hotel.

206
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,080
OK.

207
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,930
Don't worry.

208
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,360
Bye.

209
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
So your mother and sister came here

210
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,180
for your birthday.

211
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Be happy about it.

212
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,580
It means that they care about you.

213
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm happy.

214
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,320
But you don’t look happy.

215
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,040
Smile.

216
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,480
Let's go.

217
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,090
My brother wasn't happy

218
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
to see me,

219
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,740
but he's always happy to see Li Jianjian.

220
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,520
Chen Ting just came back

221
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,780
to visit her relatives

222
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,780
and celebrate Ling Xiao's birthday.

223
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,500
Don't mind it too much.

224
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,050
She didn't make it to her mother's funeral

225
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,080
and it must be a lifetime of regret.

226
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,680
She didn't come back before,

227
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
but when Ling Xiao is back,

228
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,800
she came back too!

229
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,000
So?

230
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,720
Do you want to drive them

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,900
back to Singapore?

232
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,800
You don't think

233
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,930
it's appropriate, either.

234
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
I just think

235
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,560
she must be

236
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
up to something

237
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,120
this time.

238
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,480
Jianjian called and told me

239
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,400
that Chen Ting was really nice to her.

240
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,420
People can change sometimes.

241
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
She was nice?

242
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,920
That can't be true!

243
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,650
I don't believe she can change!

244
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,920
Sew it yourself!

245
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,180
Go back home and figure it out on your own.

246
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,500
I don't know how to sew!

247
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,880
Ling Xiao.

248
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Ling Xiao.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,280
Why are you so quiet?

250
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,600
Ling Xiao.

251
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,500
Do you want to abandon me and your sister?

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Ling Xiao.

253
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,680
Do you want to abandon us?

254
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,160
Xiao.

255
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Why are you here?

256
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,850
I can't fall asleep.

257
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
May I share your bed?

258
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,640
No.

259
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,560
Don't be so stingy.

260
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,770
I'll just sleep here for one night.

261
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,400
Now go to sleep.

262
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,520
Sleep, sleep.

263
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,610
Don't look at me.

264
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,280
Don't think about anything.

265
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,360
Even if Mars

266
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,960
will hit the earth tomorrow,

267
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,320
we’ll still sleep tight tonight.

268
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,760
♫Light is hidden in the night by the sunset♫

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,560
♫But the sleepless stars dismantle the darkness♫

270
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
I'll be by your side,

271
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,680
♫The night sky won’t be dark♫

272
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,240
so go to sleep.

273
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,200
♫As long as the moonlight shines♫

274
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,920
♫through the chinks♫

275
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
♫If you ask the night sky♫

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,880
♫About the twists and turns before dawn♫

277
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,440
♫It’s just the past which will be gone tomorrow♫

278
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,640
♫So silence requires♫

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,680
♫Not too much talk♫

280
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,360
♫It just bears with everything♫

281
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,680
You say, your mother and sister

282
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,440
really can't do

283
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
without you.

284
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
It's not long since you came back

285
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,290
and they followed you here.

286
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
It's been a long time since my mother came back

287
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,960
and Chengzi is having her summer vacation,

288
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
so they came back.

289
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,280
And they stay in a hotel.

290
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,440
You don't have to take care of them

291
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,240
and they won't affect your work.

292
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,880
Xiao,

293
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,080
I think you should

294
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,120
take some time off

295
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,320
to take them out to play.

296
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,080
Didn't Chengzi say

297
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,610
that she wants to go around?

298
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,400
I'll ask my colleagues

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
to see who can change shifts

300
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,960
with me.

301
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,640
OK.

302
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,120
Ms. Chen Ting stays at the hotel

303
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,240
that you work at,

304
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,920
so if you see her,

305
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,580
don't forget to say hello, OK?

306
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,040
That would be weird.

307
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
I don't think

308
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,600
she remembers me.

309
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,930
I would rather not do it.

310
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
You're right.

311
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Our national hero Zheng Chenggong

312
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,980
was valued by the Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty.

313
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,240
The Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty...

314
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
Don't do it when you're eating,

315
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,960
or you'll upset your stomach.

316
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,720
No.

317
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,160
I have to go to the museum today

318
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,360
to get familiar with the environment

319
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
and I have to recite

320
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,080
all the materials within one week.

321
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,340
And then I'll start working officially.

322
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,320
What do you mean by all the materials?

323
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,360
The local history,

324
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
the important historical figures,

325
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,520
the major historical events

326
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,280
and the information,

327
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,720
cultural value and significance

328
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,980
of these collections.

329
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
It's summer vacation now

330
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
and a lot of students and their parents come,

331
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,730
so we're short of hands.

332
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,680
You're good at remembering your lines,

333
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,610
so it's just a piece of cake for you.

334
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,400
You're right.

335
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,440
It's not challenging

336
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
for me.

337
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
Which emperor valued

338
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,920
Zheng Chenggong a lot?

339
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,560
The Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty.

340
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,760
Who had the highest official position

341
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,840
in ancient Xiamen?

342
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,120
Su Song of the Northern Song dynasty.

343
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,450
He was a prime minister.

344
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
In short, he excelled

345
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,120
in a variety of fields

346
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
and he was one of the greatest naturalists

347
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,480
and scientists

348
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,840
in ancient times.

349
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,480
In medicine, even Li Shizhen

350
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,640
was a big fan of his.

351
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,840
What he wrote in Illustrated Pharmacopoeia

352
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,040
was quoted up to 74 times in Compendium of Materia Medica

353
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
written by Li Shizhen.

354
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,720
and astronomically,

355
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,849
he made the Astronomical Clock Tower,

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,349
which was the earliest astronomical clock in the world

357
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,800
that was made 600 years earlier than in Europe.

358
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,560
What else would you like to know?

359
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,220
I can share more of it with you.

360
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,240
If the college entrance examination were all about rote memorization,

361
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,970
I would have been enrolled in Peking University.

362
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,250
Well, that was just bragging.

363
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,200
I'm done

364
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,240
and I'm going to the shop.

365
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,570
Is the business so good?

366
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,840
It's fine.

367
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,840
The breakfast, lunch and smoothie

368
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,900
are quite popular,

369
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
which are not very profitable,

370
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,930
but they can help

371
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
make ends meet.

372
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,800
It's the first step

373
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
to make ends meet

374
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
and it works.

375
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,520
Yeah.

376
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,760
Not bad.

377
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,480
Bye.

378
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,480
Bye.

379
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,680
Liubao's father

380
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,020
can't eat anything

381
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,200
after having chemo.

382
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
It was the same the last time.

383
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,860
He can't eat and he's losing his hair.

384
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,570
He even needs someone to help him walk.

385
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,880
What a poor man!

386
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,360
Do you take care of him all by yourself?

387
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,160
What about Liubao and Jingjing?

388
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,340
Jingjing has to take care of the house

389
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,160
and we have so many ducks at home.

390
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Liubao has to work to make money.

391
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
It's so hard for him.

392
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
He saves every penny he could

393
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,370
and he transfers his salary to me as soon as he gets it.

394
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
I say, my two children

395
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,240
are not as lucky as Ziqiu is.

396
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
To be frank,

397
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,040
you're luckier than I am.

398
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,200
Didn't you say

399
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,920
that I was unlucky back then?

400
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,360
A young girl who dropped out of junior middle school

401
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,020
went to city for a better life,

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,400
but ended up being divorced while she was pregnant.

403
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
You took care of the child on your own

404
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,120
and finally

405
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,200
you met a good man,

406
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,960
but you refused him

407
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
and went to Shenzhen,

408
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,010
but after you got there, you...

409
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,480
Then you had to give your child to someone else.

410
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,520
You say,

411
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
were you lucky back then?

412
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
I was really unlucky.

413
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,770
Only you could smile

414
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,920
in such a situation.

415
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
I've cried enough

416
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,330
when I was all alone.

417
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,720
You cried?

418
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,840
We grew up together,

419
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,690
but I've never seen you cry.

420
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,040
Because just like our mother,

421
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,320
you disliked it

422
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,360
no matter what I do.

423
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,240
I avoided you

424
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,440
when I cried.

425
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
When I see you,

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
I can see our mom

427
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,520
in you,

428
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,720
and the way she looked at me

429
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,360
made me feel like a total failure

430
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,480
that annoyed her.

431
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,920
That was because

432
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,840
what you did was insane.

433
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,800
For you,

434
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,840
mom always got angry.

435
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,850
You always did what she wanted.

436
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,810
You had a boyfriend when you went out for work,

437
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,480
but she didn't like him

438
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,340
because he was from another city,

439
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,520
so she asked you

440
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,180
to marry Liubao's father in the village nearby.

441
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,260
You agreed after crying for two days,

442
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,820
because you didn't want to upset her.

443
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,080
I was right to listen to her.

444
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Liubao's father

445
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
has treated me well.

446
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
I don't regret

447
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
marrying him.

448
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
Let's not talk about it.

449
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
Come. Eat this.

450
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,160
Try this.

451
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,760
Wipe it.

452
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,440
By the way,

453
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
why didn't you

454
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
contact me these years?

455
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,760
I didn't want to trouble you.

456
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,100
Didn't you miss Ziqiu?

457
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,120
What could a mother like me

458
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,520
have done for him?

459
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,300
Every mother in this world

460
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,040
is the same,

461
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,090
for they just want their children to be happy.

462
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,920
Ziqiu went to study abroad

463
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,120
and now he has come back.

464
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Do you know that?

465
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,370
Let's not talk about it.

466
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,120
By the way,

467
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,010
come to my beauty salon some day

468
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,650
and I'll treat you to a skin treatment.

469
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,280
The wrinkles on my face

470
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,560
don’t delay my work.

471
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,130
Have you got married again?

472
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
What do you think?

473
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,040
I think you must have.

474
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,480
You're still so young.

475
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,520
Listen to me.

476
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,600
Settle down as soon as possible,

477
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,660
and then there won't be any gossip about you.

478
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
If you had married

479
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,880
with Haichao back then,

480
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,120
you wouldn't have come to this.

481
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
You just

482
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
never choose the easy way.

483
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
There's no need for that!

484
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
It'll be fine if you cherish

485
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,540
the life right now.

486
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,840
Stop talking and eat.

487
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,000
Eat it.

488
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,520
I will eat it.

489
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,480
OK.

490
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,880
Hello, this is

491
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,520
your packed meal.

492
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,640
Here you are.

493
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,320
Thank you.

494
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Then I'm going back to the hospital.

495
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,120
OK.

496
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,180
I'm not short of money.

497
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,680
I can take care of the medical expenses.

498
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,520
The ducks at home

499
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
are about to be ready to sell.

500
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,080
Take it! I want you to have it.

501
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,040
I can't accept your money. It's not easy for you to make money.

502
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm leaving.

503
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,080
Sister

504
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,760
keep in touch.

505
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,120
Hello?

506
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,120
Mei,

507
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
Dongdong is gone!

508
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
He's gone?

509
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,960
Calm down.

510
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,040
Take a look at the warehouse

511
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,640
to see if he's in there again.

512
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,720
No, I've checked the camera footage

513
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,760
and he went out after a dog.

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,130
I'll come back soon.

515
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,640
Mom, it's so heavy.

516
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,120
Ask Xiao to pick us up.

517
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Let me help you.

518
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
Forget it.

519
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's go.

520
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,370
Hello, do you have an appointment?

521
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,680
No, I don't.

522
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm here to see Dr. Ling Xiao.

523
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm sorry, but you need an appointment to see a doctor here.

524
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
And Dr. Ling

525
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,240
is treating a patient right now.

526
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,480
I'm not here for medical treatment.

527
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,560
I'm his mother.

528
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,600
Oh, you're Dr. Ling's mother!

529
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,770
I just came back from Singapore

530
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
and I want to see where he works.

531
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,960
Well.

532
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,400
Come and give it to me.

533
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
I've brought you

534
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,640
some small gifts from Singapore.

535
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,480
Try it.

536
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,200
Thank you.

537
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,560
That's so kind of you.

538
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,800
I want to thank you

539
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
for taking care of Ling Xiao.

540
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,720
Hello!

541
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,040
I'm a colleague of Ling Xiao's

542
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,370
and my name is Feng Xixi.

543
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,440
Don't stand up.

544
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
He's treating a patient right now.

545
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,040
Would you like me

546
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,200
to take you to the lounge, so you can wait for him over there?

547
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
It's about to finish.

548
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,120
Thank you very much.

549
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,050
You're welcome.

550
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,320
Well,

551
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
I've brought some gifts

552
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
from Singapore.

553
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Please share them

554
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,720
with your colleagues.

555
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,440
OK.

556
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,160
Good.

557
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,400
You're Ling Xiao's younger sister,

558
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,530
Qin Meiyang, right?

559
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Did Ling Xiao tell you about her?

560
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,330
I saw it when he filled his file.

561
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,160
Give me a gift box.

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,040
This is for you.

563
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,460
We can't accept it.

564
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,240
Aunty,

565
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,040
courtesy calls for reciprocity.

566
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,160
Ling Xiao likes it

567
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,820
and I think you'll like it too.

568
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,400
This electric toothbrush

569
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,600
has three times four modes.

570
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
When you get home,

571
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,640
you can try and figure out which mode you like the most.

572
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,000
It's quite functional.

573
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,280
Say thank you.

574
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,960
Thank you.

575
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,010
You're welcome.

576
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,720
Let's go.

577
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,320
OK.

578
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,400
Be careful.

579
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Thank you.

580
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,320
You're welcome.

581
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,120
Take one later.

582
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,760
OK.

583
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,720
OK.

584
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,240
Song,

585
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,320
explain the matters needing attention

586
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,640
to the patient.

587
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,360
Please come back next Tuesday.

588
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,080
Thank you.

589
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
This way, please.

590
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
Dr. Ling, thanks to your mother.

591
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,580
Your mother is so nice.

592
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,520
My mother?

593
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,800
Yes, she gave us

594
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,440
the pineapple tarts.

595
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,640
And she's talking with Dr. Feng

596
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,800
in the lounge now.

597
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,730
I'm afraid of seeing a dentist.

598
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,280
Seeing a dentist

599
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
scares me.

600
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
It's fine. It doesn't hurt that much.

601
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,440
Are you done now?

602
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,440
No worries.

603
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
Dr. Feng has been here talking with me the whole time.

604
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,560
Well,

605
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,600
I was resting.

606
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,080
Since Ling Xiao is done,

607
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,680
let him show you around

608
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,680
and I have an appointment

609
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,560
at 11 o'clock.

610
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,240
OK, OK.

611
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,520
Then I'll leave you to it.

612
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll treat you to dinner later.

613
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,240
OK. Thank you.

614
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,240
I'm leaving now. Bye.

615
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,920
Thank you.

616
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,700
You should have called me.

617
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,920
I called,

618
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,440
but you were busy the whole time.

619
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,400
I mean before you came here,

620
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,730
not after you came here.

621
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,800
I just want to have a look at

622
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,240
where you work.

623
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,640
Besides,

624
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,680
I've brought a lot of gifts

625
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,960
for your colleagues

626
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,760
from Singapore.

627
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,880
You can't

628
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,400
buy it here.

629
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,140
Everything can be bought online.

630
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,640
This is etiquette.

631
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,360
What do you know?

632
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,440
I've discussed with my colleagues

633
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
and I'll change shifts these two days.

634
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,840
So I'll show you around this afternoon.

635
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,560
Chengzi,

636
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,160
do you want to go to Gulangyu tomorrow?

637
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,800
Really?

638
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
You don't want it?

639
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,810
The travel guide suggests taking a ferry.

640
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
What would you like to eat for lunch?

641
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,080
Whatever.

642
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,200
Ginger duck will do.

643
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,600
Then let's have it.

644
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,880
OK.

645
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,690
I'll go and get changed.

646
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,120
Yes.

647
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,930
There's something wrong with the boy.

648
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,800
He has autism.

649
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,760
Yes.

650
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,000
I got it. Thank you.

651
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,280
I'll go and get him now.

652
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Thank you so much.

653
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,440
Found him?

654
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes.

655
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,600
He didn't talk when someone talked to him,

656
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,440
so they sent him

657
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,700
to the police station.

658
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,160
Well,

659
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
ask everyone to come back.

660
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,200
No need to keep looking.

661
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,720
OK. OK.

662
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,520
Then let's go

663
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,380
and pick him up.

664
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,520
The police asked me to bring the certificates

665
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,080
and asked his guardian to pick him up.

666
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,040
What to do now?

667
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,320
His guardian?

668
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,960
But

669
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,200
Dongdong doesn't speak

670
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,320
or recognize us.

671
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,560
Let me see

672
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,720
who can help.

673
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,080
Ling Heping!

674
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,690
Ling Heping can help us.

675
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,880
Who is Ling Heping?

676
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,130
Li Haichao's neighbor.

677
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,160
Thank you so much this time.

678
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,200
Sorry to have troubled you.

679
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,480
If it were not for Mr. Ling,

680
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,280
I wouldn't have known what to do.

681
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
As long as the boy is fine.

682
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,040
May I ask you

683
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,120
what his mother

684
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,640
had done that got her

685
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,370
into prison?

686
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,200
His mother

687
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
worked for me

688
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,880
when I was a store manager

689
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,540
in a beauty salon in Shenzhen.

690
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,560
Her husband was an alcoholic

691
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,920
who beat her when he was drunk

692
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,520
and he kneeled to apologize when he sobered up.

693
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
I've deal with a lot of

694
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,280
domestic violence cases.

695
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,000
As long as it happens once,

696
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,860
it'll happen over and over again.

697
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,280
Yes.

698
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,290
I asked her to get a divorce,

699
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,480
but she refused it

700
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,040
for the sake of her child.

701
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Because at least,

702
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,860
he didn't beat the kid.

703
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,560
The other day, he got drunk again

704
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,480
and threatened to cut her face

705
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,600
with a fruit knife.

706
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,600
She seized the fruit knife

707
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
and stabbed him to death.

708
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,640
It was self-defense.

709
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah.

710
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,280
If she stabbed once,

711
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,380
it would have been self-defense.

712
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,160
It was unjustifiable self-defense

713
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
and she was sentenced to four years in jail.

714
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,160
No one would take care of Dongdong,

715
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,690
so I take care of him for her.

716
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,680
She's coming out this year

717
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,320
and we've agreed

718
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,240
that she'll work for me

719
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
when she gets out.

720
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,520
What a poor child!

721
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,000
Yes.

722
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,120
Dog.

723
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,930
Dongdong, what did you say?

724
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,000
What?

725
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,760
Dog.

726
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh.

727
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,720
Snow Egg.

728
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,640
Do you want Snow Egg?

729
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,960
Dog.

730
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,480
Come.

731
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,960
Let me hold you.

732
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,400
Let's go and play with Snow Egg, OK?

733
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,600
Snow Egg

734
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,280
was adopted

735
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,810
by the supermarket nearby.

736
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,400
And I've told them

737
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
about Dongdong's situation

738
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,040
and they agreed

739
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,210
to let you have Snow Egg.

740
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,320
Thank you.

741
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,540
I promised not to trouble you,

742
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,720
but I've kept troubling you.

743
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,640
It's no big deal.

744
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,970
It's just petty things.

745
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,000
Ask if you want.

746
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,440
So,

747
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,890
Dongdong is not your child.

748
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,730
Then you didn't get married again.

749
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,000
No.

750
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,520
I'm single.

751
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,040
Then why did you keep it

752
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
from us?

753
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,200
It makes Ziqiu really sad.

754
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,360
I've promised

755
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,280
that since you brought Ziqiu up,

756
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,720
he is your son

757
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
and I won't see him again.

758
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,840
I'm already a bad person,

759
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,370
so I don't mind being worse.

760
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
This is good for all of us.

761
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,800
I've never said

762
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,720
that you can't see Ziqiu

763
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,360
just because I brought him up.

764
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,090
You decided it all by yourself.

765
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,680
When you came back

766
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
while Ziqiu was in Secondary Three,

767
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
I wouldn't have kept it from him

768
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,160
if you hadn't told me

769
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,890
that you had got married again.

770
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,720
I know.

771
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,040
That's why I lied.

772
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,480
I have my principles.

773
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,020
I'm a person of my word.

774
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,320
But you promised Ziqiu

775
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,720
to pick him up soon.

776
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,360
You promised him,

777
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,850
but why did you fail him?

778
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,840
Mom,

779
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
come back early to pick me up.

780
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Mom,

781
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,920
come back early to pick me up.

782
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Mom,

783
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,160
come back early.

784
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Mom,

785
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,120
come back early to pick me up.

786
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,840
He Mei, you...

787
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,190
Don't cry.

788
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,850
I feel sad to see you like this.

789
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,630
Thank you.

790
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,360
Mr. Li,

791
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,320
you've been in a daze here

792
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,520
the whole afternoon.

793
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,199
What are you thinking about?

794
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,360
You say,

795
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,080
why?

796
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,150
What is she really like?

797
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,840
Don't disturb Mr. Li.

798
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,640
He's thinking about Miss Zhang.

799
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,900
Do you do this for Li Jianjian?

800
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,570
Are you out of your mind?

801
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,360
You can think

802
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,240
about it later.

803
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,080
It's about your future career.

804
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,920
How could you give up

805
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,120
such a great job?

806
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,800
Don't answer it!

807
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,080
Mom, don't do this. What do you want to do?

808
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,320
I don't want you to take it!

809
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,520
Please don't do this!

810
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,720
Stop it. Stop it.

811
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Is that Jianjian?

812
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,320
Come in, please.

813
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,840
It's been so many years since I saw you last time.

814
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Now you've become a grown-up woman.

815
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
You're so pretty.

816
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,210
You're back.

817
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,210
Where have you been?

818
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,440
We went to South Putuo Temple

819
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,280
and walked by the sea.

820
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,800
What about tomorrow?

821
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,010
We'll go to Gulangyu tomorrow.

822
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,330
Just take them around for two days.

823
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,610
You don't look well.

824
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,020
I'm a little tired.

825
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,880
Go and take a bath.

826
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,540
Good night.

827
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,300
Good night.

828
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,720
Hush.

829
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,010
Close the door. Close the door.

830
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,930
Don't let Ziqiu know that I'm here.

831
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
I sneaked in

832
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,720
when he was taking a bath.

833
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,960
Go and take a bath

834
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,490
and then come back to sleep.

835
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,200
What are you drawing?

836
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,240
I want to make

837
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,300
a collection of endangered species,

838
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
including Tibetan antelope, panda

839
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,500
and finless porpoise.

840
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,080
Look!

841
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,100
This finless porpoise is so cute.

842
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,840
I see.

843
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,720
I thought

844
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,760
it was small animals having a meeting.

845
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Having a meeting?

846
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,000
Small animals having a meeting.

847
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,080
What's wrong?

848
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,120
Yeah!

849
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,400
I've been thinking

850
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
about the name of this collection.

851
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,280
Du Juan wants to name it the Endangered Animals,

852
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,000
but I think it's too heavy.

853
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,900
Having a meeting is great.

854
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,460
I'll name it Small Animals Having A Meeting.

855
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,530
I'm going to take a bath.

856
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,810
You go back to sleep.

857
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,500
Can you fall asleep when I'm not here?

858
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,120
Do you know

859
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,920
that you move a lot in your sleep?

860
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,720
Really?

861
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,100
I didn't before, did I?

862
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,760
Well,

863
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
when I was asleep,

864
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,210
you kicked me and woke me up several times.

865
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,660
Tomorrow morning,

866
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,260
I'll take them to Gulangyu

867
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,780
and it would be bad if your father knows about it.

868
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,400
I thought I could help you

869
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,930
sleep better by being here.

870
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,060
Thank you for your concern. Now go back to sleep.

871
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,720
Is Ziqiu out there?

872
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,250
I'll go and check it.

873
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,090
He's in his bedroom.

874
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,000
OK.

875
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
If you can't fall asleep,

876
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,440
text me

877
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,840
or call me.

878
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,200
I'll be drawing the pictures anyway.

879
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
Got it. You're so wordy.

880
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,160
Happy birthday!

881
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,840
I wish you well

882
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,440
and happy forever!

883
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,960
Li Jianjian.

884
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,570
You've made breakfast?

885
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,760
It's Ling Xiao's birthday today

886
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,200
and we planned

887
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,160
to make a bowl of long-life noodles for him.

888
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,560
But he left early in the morning

889
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,000
to take his mother and sister

890
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,880
to Gulangyu.

891
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
Why didn't he tell us?

892
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,440
Then it's all in vain!

893
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,160
It won't be in vain. We can eat it.

894
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,160
Ziqiu,

895
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
don't get up so early every day

896
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,360
to make breakfast.

897
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,400
Let's take turns.

898
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,240
It's fine. I'm used to getting up early.

899
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,720
Yes, he's used to it.

900
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Let's take turns.

901
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,320
Look at you.

902
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,920
You look pale recently.

903
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,340
How is the museum work?

904
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,040
How to put it,

905
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,640
I feel I'm much better educated

906
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,840
after some hard work.

907
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,980
I'll see how much longer she can keep.

908
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,520
Mingyue,

909
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,240
not everyone does the jobs

910
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,680
that they like.

911
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,200
Job is for making a living.

912
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,560
Actually, I just like

913
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
not working.

914
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,640
Don't make excuses.

915
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,370
Li Jianjian,

916
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,240
come to eat.

917
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,480
OK.

918
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,800
I can't eat.

919
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,800
My dad is coming back from a business trip.

920
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,240
I have to pick him up at the airport at nine o'clock.

921
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,520
Take a loaf of bread.

922
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,520
No, thank you.

923
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,720
Go for it!

924
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,180
Go and fight to the end!

925
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,180
Go and fight to the end!

926
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,090
You two are so funny.

927
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,880
Got it.

928
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,890
I'm leaving.

929
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,520
OK.

930
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,840
Dad! Dad!

931
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,280
Let's go and talk about it.

932
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,640
I asked mom out to dinner

933
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
by promising to give her the family register book.

934
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,280
Your mother is out of mind this time!
