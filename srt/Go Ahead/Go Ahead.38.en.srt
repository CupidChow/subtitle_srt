1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,000
Episode 38

4
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,190
Ling Xiao invited his aunt to dinner.

5
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,120
Ziqiu went away

6
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,030
early in the morning.

7
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,430
He bought us McDonald's.

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,220
You didn't sleep well?

9
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,920
No.

10
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Why didn't he buy one more portion?

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Did he forget Chengzi is in our flat?

12
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,840
I told you earlier.

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,500
Mingyue went home yesterday.

14
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,380
What's wrong with you? Alzheimer's?

15
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,240
Jianjian!

16
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,240
I came across a very good

17
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,040
drama script.

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
You want to act?

19
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
How did you know that?

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,160
You will definitely go back to acting!

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
I just knew you won't work in the museum

22
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,880
for long.

23
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,620
But I didn't expect

24
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,579
you'd be so eager to leave.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,120
A friend of Zhuang Bei's is

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,160
a drama director.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
He has a role

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
for me to go for an audition.

29
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Do it.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
Go ahead if you can do the job.

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,960
If you can't,

32
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,720
just go back to your current work.

33
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,800
You support me?

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
If I don't act well,

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,160
you won't laugh at me, will you?

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,560
Of course, I support you!

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,820
This is your dream!

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,240
What will you think if someone accuses me of plagiarism

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
and says I'm not qualified to

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,370
do woodcarving?

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,960
That's ridiculous!

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,880
You don't even need to plagiarize at all!

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,320
Wood is like play dough

44
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,720
in your hands!

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
Your little hands

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,400
are naturally made

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,530
for sculpting wood!

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,320
I think

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,260
you were born to be an actress!

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,079
I'll make a call now to ask for leave.

51
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm going for the audition.

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,020
I memorized the lines yesterday.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,880
Go for it!

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
Chengzi, let’s eat

55
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't you have

56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,520
to go to work soon?

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,280
Get up now.

58
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,480
Can you come in

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,950
for a second?

60
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,680
I saw the wires

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,640
in that pair of headphones

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
on your desk exposed.

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,640
It's bad for your hearing to use headphones long term.

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
I bought you a desktop speaker

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,240
after work yesterday.

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
Thank you for letting me

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,680
stay in your room.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,640
I'll move back to live

69
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
with my mother today.

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,160
Actually, I don't like pink very much.

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,800
How is it possible that

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,920
you don't like pink?

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
All girls like pink!

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,520
How can you say you don't like a gift in the face of

75
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,180
the person who gives it to you?

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
Alright!

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,920
A pink speaker

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,120
fits my style as well.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,120
Thank you very much.

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
When you go back home,

81
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,800
don't always fight against your mother.

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,680
Even if you hate her for a hundred years,

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,600
she's still your mother.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,240
You still have to be around her, don't you?

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
You don't have a mother. How do you know?

86
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,680
But I've seen

87
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
examples like yours.

88
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,680
Look at Tang Can and Mingyue.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
They're both going through similar things.

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,240
You should learn from their experiences.

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,970
Understand?

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
What happened to them?

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,930
I'll tell you later.

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
Anyway,

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,840
if you need help

96
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
after you go back home,

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
you can tell Ling Xiao

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,720
or me.

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,250
Why would I tell you?

100
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
You can help me fight against my mom?

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,320
I can't help you fight against your mother.

102
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,380
But I can help your mother punish you.

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,120
Let's eat.

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Wait.

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,280
What?

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,720
I wasn't very friendly to you when I was little.

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,120
When was that?

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
My goodness!

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
You still remember

111
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,080
that stuff?

112
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,800
Did you just wake up from a dream?

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,840
Would I bear a grudge

114
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,570
against a little girl like you?

115
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Let's eat.

116
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,300
Hi, sister Can.

117
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,600
sister?

118
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
My mother is moving

119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
to Building 8 behind this building.

120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
I'll go home and live with mom today.

121
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,720
So close?

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Good!

123
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,240
You won't

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,370
have to hide the remote control again.

125
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,240
I didn't.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm just used

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,480
to leaving the remote control randomly.

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
I really didn't.

129
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
Seriously.

130
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Good morning!

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Good morning!

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,650
You came so early today!

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,159
Are you OK?

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
Of course, I am.

135
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Come on, start working.

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't we have clients' orders to fulfill?

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,680
Miss Li,

138
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,770
have you found the picture?

139
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,800
Not yet.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Why are you still in the mood to

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,460
work in the studio?

142
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,410
I really admire your calmness.

143
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,400
The furniture factory

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,480
has already sent an email

145
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,010
to ask about the plagiarism

146
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,880
and whether this involves infringement.

147
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
The first batch of bases for our handicrafts

148
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,740
have been made.

149
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,360
If you're convicted of infringement,

150
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,600
you'll be seen as breaking the contract.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,720
And you'll have to pay a penalty for breach of contract.

152
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,650
Stop hitting me.

153
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
I am speaking for her own good!

154
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,490
Can you stay out of this?

155
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
Get started on your work.

156
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,030
What is it?

157
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,840
It must be that

158
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
Zhou Miao told everyone

159
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200
about the copyright sale back then,

160
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,360
which made people envious,

161
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,760
so someone contacted the factory.

162
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,549
Otherwise, how could they

163
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,480
know it so soon?

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,960
From their point of view,

165
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,680
maybe they think they are

166
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
upholding justice

167
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,140
and fighting plagiarism.

168
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,920
Shameless.

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,360
I can't believe I used to

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,420
like Yufei so much!

171
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
You even like Zhou Miao.

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,930
It's not surprising that you liked Yufei.

173
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,160
Ziqiu,

175
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,080
can I leave work

176

Why?

My mother is moving house today.

179
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
I want to go back

180

and help her clean up the flat.

181

OK.

182
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,640
Are there only strawberry mousse

183

and chocolate mousse today?

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,960
Yeah.

185
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,120
We are making fewer and fewer kinds of desserts.

186
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
We have no choice.

187
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
They don't sell well.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,160
Why don't we change it

189
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,820
into a quick meal restaurant?

I can't.

I'm now in Mount Heng.

Why did you go there?

198
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,780
I need the picture now.

199

Don't you need to look after your dad?

200

They say all the temples of the Five Great Mountains answer to prayers.

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,900
So, I've prayed in all of them.

I just came out of the Zhurong Temple.

Is the picture so important?

You're here already? Are you ready?

Director, I read the script all night.

It's OK.

I shouldn't have told you about this audition.

When Mingyue was living at home,

294

your attention was drawn to her,

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,600
so it wasn't this bad.

296
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,280
Now it's like I'm jailed,

all the time.

300
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,200
I couldn't walk on the mopped parts of the floor,

301
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
nor could I make noise when chewing,

or lie in bed without taking a shower.

303
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160

anything you think is healthy,

305
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,600
and had to

306
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,160
eat it happily.

But after a quarrel, you'd complain to my mother

and your mother.

311
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
Then the two old ladies

312
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
would take turns to call me

313
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,020
and ask me not to make you angry again.

314
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,600
But...

315
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,560
what's wrong with me

316
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,680

You're always right!

320
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,160
And I didn't want to complain at all.

321
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,760
I was too frustrated,

322
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,080
so I went home and talked to them a little.

323

Yes, yes. You're absolutely right.

and now you want to divorce me?

329

Whom did I live for

330
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,360
for most part of my life?

331
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,640
Didn't I live just for you two,

332
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,600
for this family?

333
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,220
I've devoted all my life into looking after you two.

334
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,240
Now that I'm old now,

335
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,250
you're going to divorce me?

336
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,050
You've made a lot of effort.

337
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,320
I give that.

338
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,440
You did

339
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
take good care of me and Mingyue

340
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
these years.

341
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,360
But it's too depressing and tiring

342
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,880
to live with you.

343
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,200
I thought

344
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,060
I could keep on living with you

345
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,520
and obeying your rules.

346
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,960
But your decision to purchase the house

347
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,120
made me realize that

348
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,000
you will not reflect on

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
your problems at all.

350
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,280
You will only keep pushing it to the extreme.

351
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,840
But...

352
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,520
haven't we agreed to cancel the purchase?

353
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,600
And I've already got back

354
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
the deposit.

355
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,040
Besides,

356
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,500
I didn't plan to buy this house to gamble.

357
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,280
Well...

358
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,120
Wasn't this

359
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,600
for the sake of our family?

360
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,370
You can do whatever you want in the future.

361
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,600
Now that Mingyue is working,

362
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,850
so our divorce will not affect her.

363
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,640
In the future,

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I will take care of you

365
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,050
as I always have.

366
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,400
If you want to continue to be a journalist

367
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
and go to Beijing,

368
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,760
I will always support you.

369
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,360
I will always be on your side.

370
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,840
Fine.

371
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,480
Fine.

372
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,720
If you really want to divorce me so much,

373
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,450
that's fine.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,480
See you tomorrow afternoon at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

375
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,520
Enjoy your meal. I'll be leaving.

376
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,829
I don't want to spoil

377
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,000
your mood for enjoying your new life.

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,440
Mom,

379
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,310
let's finish this meal

380
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,440
as a family.

381
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,550
I have something to tell you two as well.

382
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,109
Dad,

383
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,700
if you decide to get divorced,

384
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,880
I respect your decision.

385
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,160
But I think

386
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,400
you will regret it

387
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,300
after you divorce her.

388
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
You have lived with my mother

389
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,420
for more than 20 years,

390
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
but you've only helped in the kitchen

391
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,520
for a few times.

392
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,160
You never needed

393
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,520
to do any chore at home.

394
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,730
Every day when you got home,

395
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
you'd get hot food,

396
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,890
live in a clean and comfortable house,

397
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,840
and wear clean clothes.

398
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
She's been taking care

399
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,050
of my grandparents by herself.

400
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,490
She has to maintain our family relationships

401
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
with relatives and friends.

402
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,690
Everyone praises my mother

403
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,480
for being good at housekeeping.

404
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,280
I won't

405
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,240
deny that.

406
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,320
But

407
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm not good at housekeeping.

408
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,330
I'm busy with my job.

409
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,570
My mom is busy with her job, too.

410
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,920
When I went to school

411
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
and weekend classes,

412
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,780
mom was the one who would take me there and pick me up.

413
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,480
I remember that one day in my junior high school years,

414
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,810
it was raining heavily,

415
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,010
mom went on a business trip.

416
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,600
She called you to pick me up.

417
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,280
But you drove

418
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
to my primary school.

419
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,440
When I was a kid,

420
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,400
I liked dad very much,

421
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,360
because you didn't push me to do stuff.

422
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,600
You thought everything I did

423
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,520
was right

424
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,480
and good.

425
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,140
My mother was very strict with me.

426
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,360
Nothing I did

427
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,160
was up to her standard.

428
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,760
But then I grew up

429
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,720
and understood.

430
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,040
You didn't push me to do stuff

431
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,840
just because you didn't want too much trouble.

432
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,570
You didn't argue with my mother

433
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,480
not because she was right,

434
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,680
but because you thought quarreling was too much trouble.

435
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,080
Every time my mother told me off,

436
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
you always helped her

437
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,840
and said that mother was right.

438
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,260
Afterwards you'd give me 200 yuan

439
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,680
to apologize.

440
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,690
What would you want me to do?

441
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,300
Fight with your mother every day?

442
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,120
Only a harmonious family can thrive.

443
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,600
Dad, the problem of our family isn't about harmony,

444
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
but about avoiding problems.

445
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,600
You did that. I did that, too.

446
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,280
In order

447
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,200
not to get to the University of Political Science and Law,

448
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,160
I'd rather

449
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,880
leave one answer card blank

450
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,680
than striving

451
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
for my favorite school and faculty.

452
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,280
What do you mean by leaving one answer card blank?

453
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,160
I mean

454
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,400
I rebelled

455
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,530
against the wrong person all the time.

456
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,080
No one knew I actually rebelled against my mother

457
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
except for myself.

458
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,040
Qi Mingyue, you...

459
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

460
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,280
Who gave you the courage?

461
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,120
I don't know.

462
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
I just knew that

463
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
I didn't want to ask you

464
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,480
for help,

465
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,210
because you wouldn't argue with my mother

466
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,200
for me.

467
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,200
My mother turned into such a person

468
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
who never discussed things with us,

469
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,450
it's partly your fault, wasn't it?

470
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,490
You allowed her to do anything,

471
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,880
because you wanted to avoid arguing with her.

472
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,940
Having turned her into such a person,

473
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,170
now you want to abandon her.

474
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,850
What makes you think that I turned her into such a person?

475
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,440
Mom,

476
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
it's OK.

477
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,680
You can still have a good life

478
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,120
after the divorce.

479
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,720
And you'll still have me.

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,770
Aren't you living with your friends anymore?

519
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,400
Why are you mopping the floor?

520
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,860
Just hire a cleaning lady.

521
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,960
Let me do that.

522
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,960
Give me that.

523
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
Let me do it.

524
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,560
Where's aunt?

525
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,560
Doesn't she have her own household chores?

526
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,000
Then you should've called me,

527
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,530
so I'd come back to clean up.

528
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,240
You have abandoned your mom,

529
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,080
haven't you?

530
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,160
How silly!

531
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,360
Can anyone just

532
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,620
abandon their mother?

533
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,840
And I find that

534
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,040
I'm really like you.

535
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,450
You're my daughter.

536
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,960
Isn't that normal?

537
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Drink some water.

538
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah. Right.

539
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,000
If Yun was here,

540
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,770
she would be like me as well.

541
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,600
What?

542
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,480
How silly!

543
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,240
What have you been doing these days?

544
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,720
Well,

545
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,840
I've been working

546
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
at Ziqiu's coffee shop.

547
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
Why would you do that?

548
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,520
Don't go there again.

549
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,840
Why can't I go?

550
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Can't you see that

551
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,920
he hates us?

552
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,560
He Ziqiu didn't come

553
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
to your older brother's birthday.

554
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,600
Now he offered you a job?

555
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,320
Who knows what was on his mind

556
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,840
and what he's up to?

557
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,960
Mom,

558
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,160
Ziqiu is

559
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
not the kind of person you think.

560
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
Can you stop thinking everyone

561
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,140
is bad all the time?

562
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,920
Everyone has

563
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,600
a lot of things

564
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,640
to do every day.

565
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,440
No one has too much time

566
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,320
to hate us?

567
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,140
You've got persecution complex?

568
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
What's that for? It hurts.

569
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,280
Did he cast

570
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,120
some sort of spell on you?

571
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,280
How dare you betray me!

572
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,320
How could this be betrayal?

573
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,680
That's the truth.

574
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,520
What truth?

575
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,360
You've just been brainwashed.

576
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,690
So has your old brother.

577
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm your mother.

578
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
Will I ever hurt you two?

579
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,800
Why can't you listen to even a word of my advice?

580
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,120
Or are you both

581
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,920
tired of me

582
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,960
and do not want to listen to me?

583
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,000
There you go again.

584
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,640
OK, OK.

585
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,840
Let's stop arguing.

586
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,680
You won't listen to a word I say anyway!

587
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,610
What do you mean?

588
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,240
You just don't want to listen to me!

589
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

590
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,570
I can't hear you.

591
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,080
Ziqiu, what brought you here?

592
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,200
Look who is

593
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,130
working so hard.

594
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
I came to pick you up from work.

595
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
And I brought you all coffee.

596
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
Thank you.

597
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Zhou Miao, have some coffee.

598
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,400
I'll pass.

599
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,460
I don't want to go sleepless tonight.

600
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,440
He didn't sleep well last night.

601
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Forget about him.

602
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:48,960
It's OK.

603
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
There're three cups of coffee.

604
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,320
I'll take one.

605
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,440
Thank you.

606
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,160
It's OK.

607
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
Ziqiu,

608
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,540
you don't need to work in the evening?

609
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,820
I've asked for a leave.

610
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,440
Let's go home for dinner in the evening.

611
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,920
OK.

612
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,200
Call Ling Xiao

613
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,920
and tell him about it.

614
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,680
I did.

615
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,080
He told us not to wait for him.

616
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,240
Can you hurry up?

617
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Don't waste time.

618
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,480
Right away. Wait for me to wash my hands.

619
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,240
Let's go.

620
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,210
Let's go.

621
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
See you.

622
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,680
Bye.

623
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,320
Bye.

624
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
Ziqiu, drop by when you have time.

625
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,320
Bye.

626
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,520
What's the matter with you?

627
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,980
Look at her.

628
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,650
She acted like nothing is going on.

629
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,640
I feel like I'm worried about her like a fool.

630
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,600
I told you!

631
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,920
Since there is no evidence,

632
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,180
no one will believe us.

633
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,520
I don't believe a picture is

634
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,380
so hard to find.

635
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,140
I don't think it exists at all.

636
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,080
It certainly exists.

637
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,610
Hasn't Li Jianjian said it?

638
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,730
Why do you trust her so much?

639
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,680
What do you mean?

640
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,640
Juan,

641
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,800
you're so naive and innocent.

642
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,920
Haven't you

643
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,120
ever suspected that Miss Li might copy Yufei's work?

644
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,920
No one who did that will admit it?

645
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,920
Look at Yufei.

646
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,480
He's famous

647
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,410
in the industry.

648
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
He's talented and has produced many works.

649
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
He carried out his own exhibitions.

650
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Does he ever need to plagiarize?

651
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,800
Then what do you really mean?

652
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,840
I've made it so clear.

653
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
I find that only you think

654
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,160
Miss Li has talents.

655
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,160
In my opinion,

656
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
her works are just so-so.

657
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,320
She's a craftsman

658
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,080
at best,

659
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
far from being an artist.

660
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
Yufei is different.

661
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
He often deals with artists.

662
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
He lived in Paris,

663
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,810
the center of arts, for a long time.

664
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,400
I don't think

665
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,260
she can produce any evidence.

666
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,760
She signed a contract

667
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,000
with the furniture factory,

668
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,560
which carries explicit terms.

669
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,760
Whoever violates it must pay a penalty.

670
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,740
Are you going to

671
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,860
share the hefty penalty with her?

672
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,080
Are you stupid?

673
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,140
What does this have to do with you?

674
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,240
You two started the studio together.

675
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,600
You deserve to get the return on investment.

676
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,800
The plagiarism is just her own problem.

677
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,600
Besides,

678
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,010
we're also victims of her plagiarism.

679
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,880
We're kind enough not to make her pay for our loss.

680
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,280
Then what are you really trying to say?

681
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
My silly girl!

682
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,160
What I'm saying is that

683
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,840
since she signed the contract

684
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,300
with only her own name,

685
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
if you stop working with her,

686
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
you don't need to share the penalty.

687
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Why must you share

688
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,480
the penalty?

689
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,120
Stop working with her?

690
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,680
Yeah.

691
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,890
You can work with me.

692
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,420
I will graduate next year.

693
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,840
Juan,

694
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,170
I know you're kindhearted.

695
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,820
But think about it.

696
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
I won't hurt you.

697
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm doing this for your own good.

698
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,160
Good advice doesn't always sound pleasant.

699
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,820
Seriously!

700
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,560
I wish I could take my heart out

701
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,320
to show you.

702
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Alright, stop talking.

703
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,120
Fine.

704
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
How about

705
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,280
I take you to a good restaurant in the evening?

706
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,340
I have no appetite.

707
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,700
I'm going home.

708
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,160
OK.

709
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
Think about it when you get home.

710
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
Wait a minute.

711
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,200
Your apron.

712
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,600
Let me take you home.

713
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,400
No, thanks.

714
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,520
Did Mr. Ling

715
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,280
make tea like this?

716
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:54,840
He poured water...

717
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,680
Just pour it in. And it'll be done.

718
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,280
Yes. I can do it anyway I like.

719
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,250
Let's drink.

720
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,800
Have some sunflower seeds.

721
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,120
Thank you, Ms. Zhu.

722
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,200
Ziqiu,

723
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,520
what is going on

724
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,640
between Mr. Li and your mother at the moment?

725
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,570
What do you mean?

726
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
The other day while you were not here,

727
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,380
there was quite a show.

728
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,920
Your mother came to visit Mr. Li

729
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
and asked him to teach her

730
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,780
how to cook your favorite dishes.

731
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,640
But

732
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,400
they bumped into Mrs. Qian and Ms. Zhang

733
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,600
who were eating noodles here.

734
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,480
Hasn't my father broken up

735
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,340
with Ms. Zhang?

736
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,520
Broken up?

737
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,420
They haven't even held hands.

738
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,840
But Ms. Zhang acted

739
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
quite enviously.

740
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,680
She said she liked Mr. Li for his kindness,

741
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,560
but that Mr. Li only liked beautiful women.

742
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Mr. Li got very embarrassed.

743
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,890
At this time,

744
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,770
your mother stood out and said,

745
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,160
"You like his kindness,

746
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,440
he likes my look.

747
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,240
No one is better than the other."

748
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,880
Ms. He Mei was so amazing.

749
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,240
I heard today that

750
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,120
Mr. Li asked your mother

751
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
to go to a bookshop tomorrow.

752
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,700
They started dating already?

753
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,280
Why didn't he tell me?

754
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,020
I guess he was too shy to say it.

755
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,680
It's not like I don't want him to date anyone.

756
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,040
My dad is...

757
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,680
Don't sell me out.

758
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,220
Watch where you're going.

759
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,960
Dad.

760
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,440
You haven't had dinner yet.

761
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,840
Why are you drinking tea?

762
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,920
Go home now.

763
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,080
I've prepared the food.

764
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
You just need to stir-fry it.

765
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,800
OK, I got it, dad.

766
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,000
Please carry on with what you're doing.

767
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,200
What are you

768
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,600
up to?

769
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,480
Nothing.

770
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,440
Don't worry about us.

771
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,520
We'll go home soon.

772
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,480
Dad.

773
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,800
Ziqiu!

774
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,680
What?

775
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,240
If my father and Ms. He Mei

776
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,280
get married,

777
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,960
all our names will be

778
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,760
on the same household register.

779
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,800
What?

780
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,740
You don't want that to happen?

781
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,560
It's not that I don't want it.

782
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
She dumped dad once, didn't she?

783
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,560
It's been more than 20 years.

784
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,090
What if she dumps dad again?

785
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,840
Dad is so simple in his relationship.

786
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,700
I don't want him to get hurt again.

787
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,650
You have a point.

788
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,000
Tomorrow, in the bookshop,

789
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,640
let's...

790
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,640
No.

791
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,720
Say yes, please.

792
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,480
No.

793
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,120
Ziqiu!

794
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,620
When I say no, I mean no.

795
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,920
Ziqiu!

796
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,400
I mean it.

797
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm not your boyfriend.

798
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,040
Don't use your girlish charm on me.

799
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,840
It won't work.

800
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,840
You're a bummer.

801
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,370
I'll do it myself tomorrow.

802
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,600
Don't do that!

803
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,720
If you don't want to leave, then help wash the tableware in the kitchen.

804
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,400
Dad, see you.

805
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,960
Let's get out of here.

806
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,800
Dad, see you.

807
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,860
See you later, dad.

808
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,940
Which table ordered this?

809
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,920
Ling Xiao,

810
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
you mom and your sister moved today?

811
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,240
Yes.

812
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,730
Didn't she say she needed any help?

813
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,810
I don't think she needed it.

814
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
I don't know much.

815
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,720
Don't talk about it at dinner.

816
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,650
Mr. Ling, have a piece of spare rib.

817
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,560
Jianjian,

818
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
you have no news

819
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
to tell us recently?

820
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,160
Dad, I...

821
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,000
How can I have news every day?

822
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Life is like water.

823
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,410
It's boring.

824
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,280
Boring?

825
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,640
Ziqiu, what about you?

826
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,720
Me, either.

827
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,130
Is your business OK?

828
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,890
Pretty good.

829
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's profitable.

830
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,980
What about you?

831
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,040
What are you doing tomorrow?

832
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,560
Me?

833
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,760
It's just business as usual.

834
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
I'll go to the restaurant,

835
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,040
and then

836
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,320
I'll go

837
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,240
grocery shopping in the market.

838
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,960
What are you up to?

839
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
It's a secret.

840
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,000
Secret?

841
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,880
When the three of you are up to something,

842
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,150
it can't be good.

843
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,520
What if it is good?

844
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,840
Secret?

845
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,840
Whenever you guys are together, you're always up to no good!

846
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Secret?

847
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,280
Don't make trouble.

848
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,000
I've talked with the director.

849
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,710
I'll memorize my lines

850
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,960
in advance,

851
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
and then I'll quit my current job.

852
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,670
You don't have to

853
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,960
pick me up at the theater.

854
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,600
You'll look like my agent that way.

855
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,280
It's very convenient for me to take a taxi here.

856
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,040
It's OK. I can pick you up along my way home.

857
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,230
Come on. Along your way home?

858
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,710
Are you having a crush

859
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,840
on the lead actress?

860
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,150
What are you talking about?

861
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,630
I can't even remember

862
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,760
what she looks like.

863
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,320
Don't lie to me! She looks very cute.

864
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,230
Isn't she your type?

865
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,880
Wait for a few days until I get along with her,

866
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,840
then I'll ask about her impression on you.

867
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,710
Don't mess around with this match-making.

868
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,770
She doesn't look as beautiful as you.

869
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,160
What are you talking about?

870
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,320
Do I look average?

871
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,080
No. I mean...

872
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,240
you look pretty.

873
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,200
In that case, you're not lucky.

874
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,080
You don't like

875
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,480
a beautiful girl like me.

876
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,760
You have no taste!

877
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,890
No fortune, either!

878
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,210
Back then, I was just...

879
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,160
OK, OK!

880
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,880
I've moved on already.

881
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,040
Back then, I was just hot-headed

882
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
and impulsive.

883
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,250
It's better to have you as a pal.

884
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,610
You've been a great pal.

885
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,440
I'll go home tomorrow

886
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,600
and talk to my mom.

887
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,600
If she doesn't agree,

888
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,040
I will

889
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,280
keep fighting.

890
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,040
Well, just don't lose your cool.

891
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,640
Have a nice talk with your mom.

892
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,600
If it doesn't work,

893
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,330
I'll go and talk to her with you.

894
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,880
Are you crazy?

895
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,220
If you go with me, what would it look like?

896
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,360
Mingyue!

897
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,810
Mrs. Jin, you're here, too?

898
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,640
Yeah.

899
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,000
Tang Can, you've finished work?

900
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,840
Well, I should go then.

901
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,970
Text me on WeChat if you need anything.

902
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,960
OK.

903
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,080
He's your boyfriend?

904
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,160
No, no, no.

905
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
He used to be my schoolmate,

906
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
now a good friend.

907
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,680
Tang Can, please take my mom back.

908
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,040
I need to talk to him.

909
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,180
You need to talk to him?

910
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,770
It's about legal stuff.

911
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'll be back soon.

912
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Mingyue knows him too?

913
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,140
We're all friends.

914
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,320
Mrs. Jin, let's go.

915
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,400
OK.

916
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,320
Zhuang Bei!

917
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,100
Zhuang Bei!

918
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,360
I didn't plan to go up there.

919
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,920
Don't worry.

920
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,840
I won't disturb you anymore.

921
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,000
I know. I know.

922
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,600
I...

923
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,220
I just wanted to apologize to you.

924
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm sorry.

925
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,440
What?

926
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,860
You don't have to apologize to me.

927
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,280
When you told me you liked me,

928
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,050
I shouldn't have treated you that way.

929
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
It's all in the past.

930
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,500
You just don't like me.

931
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,050
Besides,

932
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,160
you have the right to reject me.

933
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,720
Yes.

934
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,440
I do have the right to reject you.

935
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,200
But I really shouldn't have

936
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,530
rejected you like that.

937
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,480
I should be grateful that

938
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,240
you liked me.

939
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,200
And you really

940
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
haven't done anything wrong at all.

941
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,940
I shouldn't have insulted you

942
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,920
and hurt you.

943
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,600
I've been wondering

944
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,360
why I was

945
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,240
so uncomfortable

946
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,490
and afraid when you told that you liked me.

947
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
And I kept on thinking about it.

948
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,960
But now I understand.

949
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
I don't hate you.

950
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,480
I hate myself.

951
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,200
Why?

952
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,120
You may not know me very well.

953
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I have low self-esteem

954
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,520
all the time.

955
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,720
I really can't

956
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,240
think of any merit in me

957
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,680
that is worth liking.

958
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,480
When you told me that

959
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,010
you fell in love with me at first sight,

960
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,360
I was actually scared,

961
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,840
because once you get to know

962
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,880
the real me,

963
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
you'll feel let down.

964
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,000
How can it be possible?

965
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,880
You will.

966
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,700
Because...

967
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,840
Because I always

968
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,170
bury my head in the sand,

969
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,610
and I'd do anything to stay out of trouble.

970
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,160
I'm a very indecisive person.

971
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,480
I feel like

972
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm not even brave enough to speak up my mind.

973
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,980
And I'm especially

974
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,730
afraid of letting people down.

975
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,320
I hate myself so much

976
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,450
for being like this.

977
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,800
I once thought that

978
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,400
if I were a boy,

979
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
I would not like

980
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,130
such a girl, either.

981
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,960
Love at first sight

982
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,260
can be really frightening actually.

983
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,080
It means that

984
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,600
in this person's eyes,

985
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,120
she's radiant

986
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,040
and perfect.

987
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,530
I'm not that kind of person.

988
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,320
I'm a coward

989
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
full of flaws,

990
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,440
trying to hide beneath

991
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
a disguise.

992
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,960
So now,

993
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,090
you've decided not to hide?

994
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,880
Yes.

995
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,090
Li Jianjian told me that

996
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,970
her older brother said that

997
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,560
people grow up in an instant,

998
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
a moment

999
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,130
only they themselves know.

1000
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
I didn't understand it

1001
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
until

1002
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,570
my parents wanted to get divorced.

1003
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,480
Only at that moment, did I realize I should grow up,

1004
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,920
I should support this family,

1005
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,780
and that I have a responsibility.

1006
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,640
Your parents

1007
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,560
got divorced?

1008
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,460
Maybe I'm not in a position

1009
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,520
to say this.

1010
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
But I don't think

1011
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,440
their divorce

1012
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,130
is necessarily a bad thing.

1013
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,680
And don't

1014
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,120
look down on yourself like that.

1015
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,200
Everyone has flaws.

1016
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,060
I've got a good share of mine, too.

1017
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,680
I also

1018
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
hurt someone

1019
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,410
who told me she liked me.

1020
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,300
I regret it so much now.

1021
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,240
Humans make mistakes

1022
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,440
Thank you.

1023
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,000
I treated you nastily,

1024
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,060
but you still comforted me like this.

1025
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,560
I wish I was comforting you.

1026
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,560
But seriously,

1027
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,060
look at you,

1028
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
you do TV shows

1029
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,040
to help

1030
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,120
so many people in need.

1031
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
There're not so many people

1032
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,160
like you in the world.

1033
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,980
You're a girl with a kind heart and a pretty face.

1034
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,640
Thank you.

1035
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,380
You're really a very nice person.

1036
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,200
It's my problem not accepting you.

1037
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,040
Alright.

1038
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,840
Let's stop being polite.

1039
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,680
It'll be fine

1040
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,120
as long as you don't

1041
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,480
see me as a monster in the future.

1042
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,640
I won't!

1043
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,920
Thank you

1044
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,200
for forgiving me.

1045
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,320
It's all in the past.

1046
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,720
It doesn't matter

1047
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,560
that much now.

1048
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,800
Zhuang Bei!

1049
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,280
You're a handsome and kindhearted man!

1050
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,480
Thanks.

1051
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Then, can I add you back

1052
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,720
on WeChat?

1053
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Maybe...

1054
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,080
no.

1055
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,120
I was kidding.

1056
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,410
I'll scan your code.

1057
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,440
Thank you.
