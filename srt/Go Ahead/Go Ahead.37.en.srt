Episode 37

4
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
OK.

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,520
It's all my fault,

6
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,750
OK?

7
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,250
It's not your fault.

8
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
It's my fault.

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,140
You hate your mother and it's not your fault.

10
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,000
You only care

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,560
about your father

12
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,640
and even the neighbors.

13
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,040
Because they care for me!

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,570
Why don't you care about me?

15
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,040
Aunt,

16
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,760
I'm sorry

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,400
to have let you

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
see this.

19
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
Thank you for helping us.

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,360
You're welcome. It's what I should have done.

21
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
Don't be angry with your mother.

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm really sorry.

23
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,880

I don't want you to meet her.

33
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,140

I think

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,040
she'll hate me more then.

38
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
I planned to be on my best behavior.

If she wants to be respected,

she should at least be respectable.

She's your mother.

48
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,040

Don't be sad.

52
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
People say unpleasant things

53
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
when they're angry.

54
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
I know.

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
But this time

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,680
I really want to make it up to him.

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,520
I know

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,280
I've done many wrong things.

59
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,760
When he was little,

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,120
when he needed me most,

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,160
I wasn't there for him,

62
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,000
so I want to spend more time with him

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
to help him,

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,040
take care of him

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,640
and be with him.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
But I didn't expect

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
it to be so hard.

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,280
Mothers in this world

69
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
are the same.

70
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,640
But even if you don't like

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
his girlfriend,

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,000
you should

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
tolerate it.

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
Besides they're

75
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
so in love right now.

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,680
I know.

77
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
But I really don't like

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
this girl.

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,159
No wonder you don't like her.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
I don't think

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,090
she's good, either.

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
She doesn't try

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
to make you happy,

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
and she even

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
asked Ling Xiao to...

86
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,760
If they get married

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,880
in the future,

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,640
your son won't be yours again.

89
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,760
Mom.

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
Ms. Song.

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,440
Mingyue, what brought you here?

92
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,000
Your mother didn't tell me that you were coming.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
I need to see my mother for something urgent.

94
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,640
Mrs. Qi, then I'll leave you to it.

95
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
I'll go and eat by myself.

96
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,440
OK.

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,200
See you later.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,330
Thank you, Ms. Song.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,720
Mom,

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,440
why would you

101
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,640
do this with my dad?

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,280
It will make

103
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,800
your father and you happy

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,560
if we get a divorce, right?

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
Please don't be mad.

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Are you really going to get a divorce

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
with my dad on Friday?

108
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
It will make both of you happy.

109
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
Then you can go

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,120
wherever you want

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
and you don't need to lie to me again.

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,920
Mom, I'm sorry.

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm so sorry.

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,280
When I was in high school,

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,920
I was really childish.

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
I really regret it now.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
I fought against you

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
and I didn't get a good result.

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
I could have been admitted

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,840
into a better university.

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm sorry to have let you down.

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,000
You think you've let me down?

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
You've let yourself down!

125
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,320
Everyone works so hard

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,120
to get into a great college.

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,650
Do you think they're fools?

128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,640
If you could get admitted to Tsinghua or Peking University,

129
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,920
do you think I would have stopped you?

130
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,080
I really regret it.

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,520
I kept it

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,320
in my mind for so long,

133
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,760
but I can't tell you about it.

134
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,240
Right now,

135
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
I just want to go back

136
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,010
and slap myself in the face.

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,640
I can slap you in the face right now.

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,040
I...

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,040
Mom!

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,720
Mom!

141
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,370
Please don't hit yourself.

142
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
Please don't!

143
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,280
Why do you both hate me so much?

144
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,560
How could you do this to me?

145
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,440
What have I done wrong?

146
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
Tell me!

147
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,840
I've spent my life

148
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
for the two of you,

149
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
but now you just want

150
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
to leave me.

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Mom!

152
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Do you hate me and want to abandon me

153
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,280
just because I want

154
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,130
to work in Beijing for two years

155
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,760
and I didn't listen to you?

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Don't you want to go to Beijing

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
to run away from me?

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,960
Do you think I don't know it?

159
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,600
I thought so before,

160
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,480
but Mom,

161
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,420
right now I'm doing it for myself.

162
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,160
I want to be a journalist,

163
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,280
you know?

164
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
I love this job.

165
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,240
I don't want to just take phone calls

166
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,280
at a local channel

167
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,240
to mediate.

168
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,640
I want to report current affairs.

169
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
I want to report people's lives.

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
I want to be a documentary journalist.

171
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,800
Mom, that's my dream.

172
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Do you understand it?

173
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,280
I was wondering

174
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,080
why you were home during the day.

175
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
So that senior of yours

176
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,360
saw your design

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,500
when he was at your studio?

178
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,240
He came to visit me

179
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,600
when he heard

180
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,930
that I started a studio.

181
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,960
My sketchbook

182
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,280
was on my working table

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,930
and he picked it up and looked at it.

184
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
How would I have known it?

185
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
You said it was based

186
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,040
on a photo,

187
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,500
so which photo?

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Back then,

189
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,210
when we were in high school,

190
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,680
Mingyue took a photo of us

191
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
with the camera her mother bought for her

192
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,850
when we were on the playground.

193
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,880
Like this.

194
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,580
Let's take a photo.

195
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,920
Come. One, two, three.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
She gave us the photos

197
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,360
later on.

198
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,800
So where is it now?

199
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,800
I put it

200
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
in a time capsule

201
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,400
back then.

202
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,360
Where did you bury it?

203
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,440
It was a vacant lot,

204
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,040
but now...

205
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
It's hopeless.

206
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,840
When I was in college,

207
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
my laptop was stolen,

208
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,240
so I don't have the electronic version now.

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,960
She developed the films

210
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
and gave one

211
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
to both you and Ziqiu.

212
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
Where is yours?

213
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,360
I don't know where I put it.

214
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
Let's go to Ziqiu.

215
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,720
He's good at keeping stuff.

216
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,920
Right now?

217
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,680
I'll get you a cup of coffee

218
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,440
to cheer you up.

219
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,210
Let's go.

220
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,920
A glass of kiwi smoothie,

221
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,640
a cup of latte

222
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
and a fruit salad.

223
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,520
There’s a fruit salad

224
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
in our sandwich set menu,

225
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,120
so would you like

226
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,480
to have a salad set menu instead?

227
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,920
OK.

228
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,040
OK, a salad set menu.

229
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,320
It's 92 yuan in total.

230
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,280
Cash or WeChat pay?

231
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,960
WeChat pay.

232
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,440
Please scan the code.

233
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,520
WeChat pay.

234
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,120
Ziqiu,

235
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
a glass of kiwi smoothie

236
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,920
and a cup of latte.

237
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,280
OK.

238
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,640
And a sandwich set, please.

239
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,160
OK!

240
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
Welcome!

241
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,420
What brought you here?

242
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't you have to work today?

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,040
I've changed shifts with my colleague.

244
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,160
It seems you're doing great.

245
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
You do look like

246
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,340
an adult right now.

247
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,450
Waitresses are just like this.

248
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,640
Smile when you're happy.

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,240
No need to pretend to be cool.

250
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,280
What do you want to drink?

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,410
What are you good at?

252
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,360
Fruit juice.

253
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,400
OK, please give us

254
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,000
two glasses of orange juice.

255
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
Your sister is really like you.

256
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,880
Sure she does.

257
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,280
Cao, someone from my family are here,

258
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,960
so help me make the coffee.

259
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,400
OK!

260
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,300
Have a seat.

261
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
I lived in Zhao Huaguang's house

262
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,760
when I first got abroad

263
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,480
and I was in a hurry when I left.

264
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
So I left many things in his place.

265
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,970
I don't know if he has thrown them away.

266
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,040
Ziqiu,

267
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,520
you can call

268
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,650
and ask him about it.

269
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,080
Just go back to your work.

270
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,980
Ling Xiao, look for it.

271
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,840
Maybe that album

272
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,400
was still in one

273
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,880
of your boxes.

274
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,800
When you moved over,

275
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
you got so many boxes.

276
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,020
I really can't find it.

277
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,780
Sorry, but I'd like to interrupt.

278
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm not clear about my brother's other stuff,

279
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,800
but I'm clear about his albums.

280
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,530
Qin Meiyang!

281
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,760
Three years ago,

282
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,680
my mother cut those photos into pieces.

283
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,840
If I hadn't noticed it

284
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,320
and hidden all his certificates,

285
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,000
they would have been cut

286
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,930
into pieces too.

287
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,520
It's in the past

288
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,560
and don't mention it ever again.

289
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,080
If I were you,

290
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
I would tell them all about it

291
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
to get them

292
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
better prepared.

293
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Or when mom gets crazy,

294
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,480
they wouldn't be able to handle it

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,340
because they have no experience.

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,530
I can tell you about it since my brother won't.

297
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,600
When my brother

298
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,860
was about to graduate,

299
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,460
my mother was in good health at that time,

300
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,690
so my brother planned to come back.

301
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Come, this one is better.

302
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
Don't just eat meat.

303
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,240
Have some vegetable.

304
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
You've gained so much weight that your face gets chubby.

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,930
A good appetite is a blessing, Mom.

306
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,960
What kind of blessing is that?

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,000
When you regret it one day,

308
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,730
you won't take it as a blessing.

309
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,400
Go back a little.

310
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,730
Your hair is in the bowl.

311
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,540
How is it going with your job hunting?

312
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,720
I've asked

313
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,440
about your internship.

314
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
It's pretty good.

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,040
The salary is pretty good.

316
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,280
I haven't made up my mind.

317
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,120
You should make up your mind as quickly as possible.

318
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,920
What do your classmates choose?

319
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,360
Mom,

320
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,120
would you consider

321
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
going back to China?

322
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,280
Of course no.

323
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,440
What do you mean by going back to China?

324
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,160
I've been living in Singapore since I was born.

325
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,690
And my friends are here too.

326
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,520
Right, Mom?

327
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,960
Yeah.

328
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,880
It's been about 20 years

329
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
since I moved here

330
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
and I'm used to it.

331
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,560
If I go back to China,

332
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,490
I'm afraid I might not be used to it.

333
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Besides,

334
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,640
my physical condition can't afford it.

335
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,560
Hurry up and make up your mind on your job.

336
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,020
Stop hesitating about it.

337
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520
Mom, you can take care

338
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,450
of yourself now.

339
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,760
Singapore has fully-equipped facilities

340
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,600
and Chengzi has grown up.

341
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,460
You don't have to worry about her.

342
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,240
So I want

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,130
to get a job in China.

344
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,360
The traffic is well-developed

345
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,820
and it's easy to go around.

346
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,020
Ling Heping asked you to do it, right?

347
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,720
No.

348
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
It's really hard

349
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,480
for me right now.

350
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,160
I don't want to be a burden to you.

351
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
I can go out on my own right now,

352
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,680
but I still need to use a wheelchair.

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If I fall down,

354
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,240
Chengzi can't

355
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,080
even help me get up.

356
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
Besides, if Chengzi

357
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
gets sick,

358
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I can't even get her to the hospital.

359
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
What should I do

360
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
if something like that happens?

361
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,120
I've asked the doctor

362
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
and you don't have to worry about it.

363
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
What does the doctor

364
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,200
care about?

365
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
They're not paralyzed.

366
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
How do they know how hard it is

367
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,290
for a paralyzed person?

368
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,960
It's easy for them

369
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,360
to say that!

370
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,080
What exactly does Ling Heping want to do?

371
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,160
He's not that old

372
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,280
and he can walk on his own.

373
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,880
Why does he want to take you away from me?

374
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,280
Mom, calm down.

375
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,810
I'm discussing it with you.

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,860
There's nothing to be discussed.

377
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,240
If you ask me,

378
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,680
my answer is no!

379
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
Brother, do you really want

380
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
to live with your father?

381
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,560
I planned to go back to China

382
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,619
after I graduated.

383
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,480
Please don't leave me

384
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,520
here alone.

385
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,280
I don't know how to take care of mom.

386
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,240
You've seen

387
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,720
how she is.

388
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Brother, please.

389
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,120
Please don't go.

390
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,880
Brother.

391
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,240
Mom, why didn't you knock before coming in?

392
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,850
Were you looking at the photos?

393
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,440
Whose photos?

394
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,970
No one's.

395
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Let me take a look.

396
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,140
I'm going to sleep.

397
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,600
Don't forget to knock before entering my room.

398
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,560
OK.

399
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,480
Then go to bed early.

400
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,860
Don't stay up late just because you're still young.

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm back.

402
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Brother.

403
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Chengzi,

404
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,040
did you wash

405
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,000
my sneakers?

406
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,920
I threw them out.

407
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
They're worn out

408
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,060
and I'll buy you a new pair.

409
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
What are you doing?

410
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,440
Aren't you going back?

411
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,690
Then you can see them every day,

412
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,660
so these photos

413
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,880
will be useless.

414
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,720
Can't you stop it?

415
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,120
Why?

416
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,520
They must have spoken ill of me a lot

417
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
behind my back.

418
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,560
So why should I

419
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,760
keep their photos?

420
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
As a reminder?

421
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
That would be really generous of me.

422
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,160
Sorry, but I can't do it.

423
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
You just go.

424
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,160
Don't mind me.

425
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't want to trouble you

426
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,320
and I don't want to be your burden.

427
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,920
I should have died

428
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,880
together with Chengzi's father.

429
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
Please don't do this, Mom.

430
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,720
Don't mind me.

431
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,440
I should have

432
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,560
just died.

433
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
Then I won't be a burden

434
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,840
to you anymore.

435
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Just go.

436
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
Go!

437
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,400
I got it.

438
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,640
I won't go.

439
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,090
I will get a job here.

440
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,480
What are you going to do?

441
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
Looking for my sneakers.

442
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,440
I'll go and help him.

443
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,820
Mom, I'll be back soon.

444
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
Brother, don't go!

445
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
That's a gift from someone

446
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,240
and I have to get them back.

447
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
I know.

448
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,360
I've got them back secretly.

449
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,170
They're in my backpack.

450
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
They're in my backpack.

460
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,720
Why are you sitting here?

461
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,760
Nothing.

462
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
Have they left?

463
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

464
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,320
When you show your concern,

465
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,180
your attitude is also important.

466
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
Do you know a saying,

467
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,880
"Having a mouth as sharp as a dagger, but a heart as soft as tofu"?

468
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,080
It describes someone with a sharp tone,

469
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,960
but a soft heart.

470
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,960
But most of the time,

471
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,920
a sharp tone

472
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,200
is hurtful enough.

473
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,800
So what?

474
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,480
They hate me anyway.

475
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,840
Who hates you?

476
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,360
Your brother?

477
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,640
Or Jianjian?

478
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,130
Both of them hate me.

479
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,960
Well,

480
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,580
your behaviors are really annoying.

481
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,220
It was not because of that.

482
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,680
When my brother just graduated,

483
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,940
he wanted to come back,

484
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,880
but I asked him not to,

485
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,700
because I didn't want to be with my mom alone.

486
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,960
From then on,

487
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,200
he barely

488
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,360
smiled

489
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,160
and he didn't talk much.

490
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,620
He was always in low spirit

491
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,680
and I didn't know what he was thinking about.

492
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I know it was hard

493
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,160
for him to take care of us

494
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,820
and I know how much he wanted to come back, but...

495
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,930
It's actually normal for you to be afraid.

496
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,320
You were just a kid.

497
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,200
I was 14 years old by then.

498
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,800
Every day, I told myself

499
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,320
not to be like my mom,

500
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
but what I did

501
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,770
is the same as what she does.

502
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,720
The difference is

503
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,280
when you're 14,

504
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,240
you're still a human-shaped pendant,

505
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,900
but you're not when you're 50.

506
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,440
A human-shaped pendant?

507
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,060
Think about it.

508
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,980
When you were 14 years old,

509
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,920
you couldn't take care of yourself,

510
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,380
so weren't you like a human-shaped pendant?

511
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,240
Yeah.

512
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,040
So

513
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,320
when you're 14,

514
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,520
it's forgivable

515
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,000
to behave like a child.

516
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
Besides, you said

517
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,920
that your brother didn't come back

518
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,800
mostly

519
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,680
because of you,

520
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
so how could you say

521
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,820
that he didn't care about you?

522
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,560
But Li Jianjian hates me so much.

523
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,640
After my brother comes back,

524
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,600
all of you, including her father,

525
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
speak ill of us behind our back.

526
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,720
And my brother

527
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,640
has been completely taken away by you.

528
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,970
Wait, wait for a moment!

529
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,400
Who told you that?

530
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,770
Your mother?

531
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,970
You're 17 years old now.

532
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Can't you straighten things out for yourself?

533
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
But I think so

534
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,200
after thinking about it.

535
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
When I was little,

536
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,900
I did something to Li Jianjian...

537
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,720
Anyway, Li Jianjian

538
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,880
just hates me.

539
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,280
When you were little?

540
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
Do you mean that time

541
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,640
your head got injured

542
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,720
and you lied that it was Li Jianjian

543
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
who pushed you?

544
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,320
It has been so many years.

545
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,040
Why you still haven't got over it?

546
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,200
What do you mean?

547
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,440
Do you think Jianjian is so childish?

548
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
She never holds the grudge.

549
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,880
It has been so many years

550
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,680
and she has been over it long ago.

551
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,680
You think she hates you

552
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
because you feel

553
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,570
ashamed in front of her.

554
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,680
You should apologize to her.

555
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,800
Or no one can know

556
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
what you're thinking

557
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
if you always behave like this.

558
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,320
I won't!

559
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
She will make fun of me!

560
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,320
See? You said

561
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
you didn't want to be like your mother,

562
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,480
but actually

563
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,340
you think the same way as she does.

564
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,600
Because you always think bad things about people.

565
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,680
I'll give you ten minutes

566
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,940
to adjust yourself and come back to work.

567
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,840
Hurry up and come

568
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,960
to adults' world.

569
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,660
[Zhao Huaguang]

570
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:39,540
[Zhao Huaguang]

571
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,040
Ziqiu.

572
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,920
When I first got abroad,

573
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,050
I lived in your place

574
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,890
and I left something there.

575
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,200
Did you throw them away?

576
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,080
What things?

577
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
Did you throw them away?

578
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,130
They should be in the basement.

579
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,560
I left a few photos

580
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
in an original book.

581
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,480
It won't be troublesome.

582
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
Just take a picture of them and send it to me.

583
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,680
And,

584
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
send me your bank account

585
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,730
and I'll transfer the money to you.

586
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
Keep it.

587
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,640
No need. I can make money now.

588
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,800
Your grandpa is ill.

589
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,960
Come and visit him.

590
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,000
What's wrong with him?

591
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,760
Lung cancer.

592
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,050
He has been smoking all his life

593
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,450
and he doesn't have much time left.

594
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,440
Come and visit him.

595
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
He wants to see my son.

596
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,050
Don't you have another son?

597
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
You're also my son.

598
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,240
He wants to see you both.

599
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
He's in the same city as you are, so it won't be troublesome.

600
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,040
But you're not my dad.

601
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
My photos.

602
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,040
You called me in person,

603
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,340
which means these photos are important.

604
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,240
How about this?

605
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,040
I'll help you and you'll help me.

606
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,080
You come and visit him

607
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,560
and I'll send you the pictures, OK?

608
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
OK, when?

609
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,170
Is it urgent?

610
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,920
Yes.

611
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,320
Then come and visit him

612
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,840
a couple of times these months

613
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,280
and help him

614
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,600
pass away in peace,

615
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,480
and then you can get whatever you want.

616
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,220
Why is it a couple of times now?

617
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,120
Think about it for yourself

618
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,180
and call me when you make up your mind.

619
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,640
It's very hot today.

620
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,720
So what are you going to do after work?

621
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Nothing special.

622
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,400
I'll take the subway.

623
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,840
And I'll take the bus.

624
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,080
That's my friend!

625
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm going now.

626
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,280
OK. Bye.

627
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,200
What's up?

628
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,040
You helped me big time

629
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,840
and I haven't bought you dinner.

630
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,120
My mother asked me to invite you to dinner.

631
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,080
I helped you by having a dinner,

632
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,840
so this is unnecessary.

633
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,800
And I'll treat you to a stage play after that.

634
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,040
Front-row seats for the Peach Blossom Spring.

635
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,960
The Peach Blossom Spring!

636
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
The front-row seat tickets!

637
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,800
I should treat you to dinner.

638
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,800
What would you like to have?

639
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,760
It's on me.

640
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,810
I'll treat you to some seafood.

641
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,880
Buckle up.

642
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,000
Stage play is different from films or TV plays.

643
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,880
A good stage play

644
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,680
is worth watching

645
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,920
over and over again.

646
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,360
The actors

647
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,800
are performing

648
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,120
differently on stage.

649
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,120
After accumulating experience,

650
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,800
they perform differently every time.

651
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
It's interesting.

652
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,520
And things like their lines,

653
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,440
performances and body performances

654
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,560
can't be modified

655
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,820
like those in TV plays.

656
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,160
All their merits and demerits

657
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,560
will be enlarged.

658
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,960
I think you're really talkative

659
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,640
when you talk about acting.

660
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,370
You're so excited like a child.

661
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,170
I just like watching it.

662
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,400
When you talk about acting,

663
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,520
your eyes light up.

664
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,620
But I can't make a living on it.

665
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,720
Right now I think

666
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,520
the job at the museum

667
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,240
is not bad.

668
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,250
It's stable and not tiring.

669
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
I can be someone in the audience since I can't be an actress.

670
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,600
It's the same.

671
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
It's not the same.

672
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,000
You know,

673
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,720
when you talk about your job at the museum,

674
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,480
you look gloomy

675
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,520
and depressed.

676
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,460
At least, two-thirds of my family

677
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,040
are happy now.

678
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,160
I think

679
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,320
maybe your parents have

680
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,850
some wrong notion about it.

681
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,160
They want you to be a star,

682
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,540
instead of an actress.

683
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,840
In my mom's eyes,

684
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,000
an actress is a star.

685
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,360
I don't quite understand it,

686
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,760
but I have a friend who is a stage director.

687
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,800
You know,

688
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,360
they perform in a small theater.

689
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,760
The actors are not famous,

690
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,600
neither are their plays.

691
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,360
But they still love

692
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,200
doing it.

693
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,760
I think

694
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,000
they truly love their job

695
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,440
and it's not

696
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,570
for becoming a star.

697
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,640
I didn't do it

698
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
for becoming a star, either.

699
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,160
I just love acting.

700
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,000
When the camera

701
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,540
and the light are on me,

702
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,040
and everyone looks at me,

703
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,000
I feel

704
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,840
so energetic

705
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,760
like Popeye

706
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,240
after having spinach.

707
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,480
Why didn't you

708
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,840
try stage play?

709
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,280
No, I can't do it.

710
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,400
Why not?

711
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,000
Are you kidding me?

712
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,440
Being a stage actor

713
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,320
is much more demanding

714
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,520
than being a TV actor.

715
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,680
I can't do that.

716
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,640
See?

717
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,560
It's wrong of you to think like that.

718
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,720
If you want to be a good actress,

719
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,160
you should take the challenge.

720
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,280
Forget it.

721
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,320
I was asked

722
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,880
to be a stand-in for a TV play.

723
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
How could I do the stage play?

724
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,120
I can't even be

725
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,960
a stage worker.

726
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,760
Look how unconfident you are!

727
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm unconfident,

728
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
so what?

729
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,560
I've finally made up my mind

730
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,720
to quit it

731
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,160
and I'm mentally and physically exhausted,

732
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,960
but now you ask me to take it up again.

733
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,360
If I do it again,

734
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,490
my mother will be really angry with me.

735
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,720
OK. OK.

736
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,500
Let's drop it and just eat.

737
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,800
This is outrageous!

738
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,560
She copied

739
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,040
a work of her senior.

740
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,280
How shameless!

741
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,680
I've met her in the sculpture classroom

742
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,320
and the teacher asked us to learn from her.

743
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,080
I knew

744
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,240
she had no talents.

745
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,080
How despicable!

746
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
She is a shame

747
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
to our school!

748
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,320
I hope the school leaders

749
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,640
would remove her winning works

750
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,100
from the school showroom.

751
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,940
It's shameful to have such a senior like her!

752
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,520
I used to like her.

753
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,370
What a trash!

754
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
She copied a work of her senior,

755
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,900
which made her a big trash!

756
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,780
Look at my online account.

757
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,500
[Ran]

758
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
Hello?

759
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,200
What's going on?

760
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,680
How could Yufei do this?

761
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,320
I don't know.

762
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,720
He didn't answer my call.

763
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,480
Did you tell him about your design

764
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
or did he see your design?

765
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,320
He saw it.

766
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,680
Don't you have a photo?

767
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,600
Publish it!

768
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,740
I'm looking for it.

769
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,480
This man

770
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,640
is so despicable!

771
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,360
I won't work with him!

772
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,360
Whatever.

773
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,800
Don't be so discouraged.

774
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,320
Don't read those comments

775
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
on school forums.

776
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,440
I was reading it.

777
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,680
Stop it.

778
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
Ignore those idiots.

779
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Look for the photo

780
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,600
and I'll help you

781
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,360
slander him.

782
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,720
Yeah!

783
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,000
I thought you would ask me

784
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,060
to give him a chance

785
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,740
because he's your senior.

786
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,240
He's not my senior

787
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,880
He's no longer a human being

788
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,480
since he copied my work.

789
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
Someone like him is everyone's enemy

790
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,600
and termites in the wood.

791
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,280
Well said.

792
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,880
Since you've straighten it out,

793
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,140
I'm much more relieved

794
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,410
and I'm going back to my work. Gotta go!

795
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,120
Who is that?

796
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,640
Zheng Shuran.

797
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,640
Du Juan.

798
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
Juan, what's up?

799
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,030
Have you found the photo?

800
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,360
Not yet.

801
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,040
Hurry up.

802
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,230
I've received so many messages on WeChat today

803
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,710
and they're all asking about it.

804
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,400
They believe what Yufei said.

805
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,710
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

806
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,920
Gotta go, bye.

807
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
Would you like an ice cream boat?

808
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,150
Let's go.

809
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,000
Let's go.

810
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,190
I've really seen it

811
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,710
so clearly this time!

812
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,280
A ticket at this position

813
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,440
cost 1,000 yuan at least

814
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
and I've never spent

815
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,500
so much money on it.

816
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,670
Since you like it,

817
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,040
it's worth it.

818
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,480
You spent so much money for me,

819
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
so do you want me to help you with Mingyue?

820
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,560
No!

821
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,120
I've already got over

822
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,160
with Mingyue.

823
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,600
Love at first sight

824
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,280
just comes from sexual drive.

825
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,760
It's just because you like

826
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,360
that kind of appearances.

827
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600
Love without knowing each other well

828
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,920
won't last for long

829
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,260
and it'll end soon.

830
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,440
Are you talking

831
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,320
about you or me?

832
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
Isn't it obvious?

833
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,290
I'm talking about the two of us.

834
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,760
See? After I got

835
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,800
to know you,

836
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,960
there is no way for me

837
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,620
to fall in love with you again.

838
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Thank you.

839
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,320
From now on,

840
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,960
we're good buddies.

841
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
I don't want to be your buddy.

842
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,880
I have Ziqiu.

843
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,080
Ziqiu's buddy is Ling Xiao.

844
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
Ling Xiao is his family

845
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,560
and it's not the same.

846
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,320
So don't

847
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,240
overestimate yourself.

848
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,000
Think about it.

849
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,680
If you and Ling Xiao

850
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,840
fall into the water at the same time,

851
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,400
who will He Ziqiu save?

852
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,880
Just let me drown.

853
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,440
Don't worry. I'll save you.

854
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,760
Hello?

855
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
We're at the door.

856
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,540
You're in the rehearsal hall?

857
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,560
OK, then we'll come

858
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
to you.

859
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,560
OK. Bye.

860
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,480
My director friend

861
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,880
is in the rehearsal hall.

862
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
Then I’ll go home alone.

863
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,360
Don't. Come with me.

864
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,000
I...

865
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,240
What does she

866
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,040
look like?

867
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,640
She has black hair,

868
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,480
brow-skimming bang

869
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,440
and a pair of beautiful big eyes.

870
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,160
But she's a little bit silly.

871
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
You're silly right now.

872
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,930
Best wishes for you.

873
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
She doesn't know that I'm in love with her

874
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,680
and she takes me as a friend.

875
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,560
She's in love with someone else.

876
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
So it's an unrequited love?

877
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,040
Yu Ran, have you ever had a crush on anyone?

878
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
Yes.

879
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,620
What does he look like?

880
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,360
He has black hair

881
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,600
and he wears glasses like you do.

882
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,160
He drinks with me

883
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,450
and he's a little bit silly.

884
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,600
Besides,

885
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,370
he's in love with someone else.

886
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,120
We're in the same boat.

887
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,000
So are you still in love with him?

888
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,010
Have a guess.

889
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,340
Director, we're leaving.

890
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,400
OK. OK.

891
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,680
Don't forget to come on time tomorrow.

892
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,280
Goodbye.

893
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,900
Zhuang Bei,

894
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,920
would you like to have a chat

895
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,160
with me in a coffee shop?

896
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,600
Then I'm leaving now.

897
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,600
Don't.

898
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,280
I want to introduce you

899
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,940
to my buddy.

900
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,250
You won't regret it.

901
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,250
Let's go.

902
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,200
Wait, are you setting me up?

903
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,040
This play is called

904
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,280
"Palm Up".

905
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,080
It means

906
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,640
to ask somebody

907
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,080
for something,

908
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,360
just like

909
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,840
we ask our parents

910
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,960
for money.

911
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,400
But this play

912
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
is actually

913
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,600
about asking others for love.

914
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,560
It's about a love quadrangle

915
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,200
and everyone is having a crush

916
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,800
without getting a response.

917
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,880
We plan

918
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,080
to give a public performance one month later

919
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,560
and we've even arranged the performance hall.

920
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,320
But the actress starring Xiao Fei

921
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,760
broke her leg the other day,

922
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,480
so right now

923
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,080
we have to find a substitute.

924
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,570
Don't you have an alternative?

925
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,520
We have, but she's not ideal.

926
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,580
I think you're perfect for it,

927
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,800
especially your hairstyle.

928
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,040
It doesn't need any work.

929
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,840
You look

930
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,640
just like the girl

931
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,520
that our leading actor is having a crush on.

932
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,400
You have brow-skimming bang and big eyes.

933
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,660
You look just like her.

934
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,360
Right?

935
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,320
I've told you she looks just like it and you didn't believe it.

936
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
You know what,

937
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,320
Tang Can is really good at acting

938
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
and she started acting since she was little.

939
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,800
She could shed tears instantly at the age of eight.

940
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,680
Have you watched the play

941
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,840
that I recommended to you?

942
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
Yes, it's not bad.

943
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,960
What do you mean by not bad?

944
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,360
It's amazing, OK?

945
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,600
She's just inexperienced

946
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,800
in stage acting,

947
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,200
but she's good

948
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,280
at remembering her lines.

949
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,120
A thick book

950
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,440
of materials

951
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,360
for the museum

952
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,400
cost her only a week to memorize

953
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,040
and then she worked as a guide.

954
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,240
Would you please shut up,

955
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,440
so I can talk with her?

956
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,880
OK.

957
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,920
I'll leave you to it.

958
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,800
Zhuang Bei has told me

959
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
about you

960
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,420
and your image is good.

961
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,530
But we still need

962
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,000
to have an audition.

963
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,220
We're on a tight schedule,

964
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,120
so would you like to read the play?

965
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,200
If you can do it,

966
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,330
please come to the audition tomorrow.

967
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
I need to go to work tomorrow.

968
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,600
And I've

969
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,680
given it up.

970
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,840
It's so sudden.

971
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,600
And I've never tried stage play before.

972
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,200
I might fail it.

973
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,000
And you have only one month left

974
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,360
before the public performance.

975
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,160
It's OK.

976
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,360
Just read it

977
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,360
and think about it.

978
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,120
Give me a reply before noon tomorrow,

979
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,760
OK?

980
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,090
Give it a shot. You won't regret it.

981
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,410
Aren't you going to open it?

982
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,800
Should I?

983
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,440
I think even if you want

984
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,600
to give up TV plays,

985
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,610
you should try the stage plays.

986
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,800
Do you think I can do it?

987
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,840
Of course!

988
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,720
Then what should I tell my mom?

989
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,890
I haven’t thought about it.

990
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,240
I just think

991
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,280
that you're unhappy

992
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,560
after you decided

993
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
to give it up.

994
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,560
I thought I was good

995
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,020
at pretending to be happy.

996
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,680
Everyone knows

997
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,880
that you're unhappy.

998
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,560
But we don't know how to help.

999
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,560
Thanks for helping me.

1000
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,680
In The Alchemist,

1001
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,540
there is a word,

1002
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,960
"When you make up your mind

1003
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
to do something,

1004
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,250
the whole world will help you."

1005
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,120
After I was 18, all I've experienced

1006
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,520
is when I want

1007
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,680
to go somewhere,

1008
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,920
every path is blocked.

1009
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,920
I don't want to give it up.

1010
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,060
[Palm Up]
