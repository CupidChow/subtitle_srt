00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,110
Aren't your fingerprints recorded in the lock?

5
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,170
Why don't you open the door yourself?

6
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,550
Ling Xiao,

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,130
are you abandoning me and your sister?

8
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,390
Ling Xiao, open the door.

9
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,030
Ling Xiao?

10
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,160
Ling Xiao?

11
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,800
Ling Xiao, open the door.

12
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,750
Ling Xiao,

13
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,960
are you really going to abandon us?

14
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,150
Are you abandoning your mother and sister?

15
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
Ling Xiao!

16
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,550
Ling Xiao!

17
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,390
Ling Xiao!

18
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,550
Hi, is this order for this house?

[Hubiao Meal Delivery]

20
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,110
Yes, that's right.

21
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,110
It's from here.

22
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,000
Is it yours?

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,390
Yes, give it to me.

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,760
Thank you.

25
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,670
Ling Xiao, you're here?

26
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,440
The delivery guy

27
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,390
has been knocking on the door for so long,

28
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,440
but you didn't even open it!

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,630
I'll put it here.

30
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,360
Bring it to me.

31
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,630

Faster, Ling Xiao.

42
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,159
You won't even break into a sweat like this.

43
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,440
You don't usually jog.

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,640
If you run so fast straight away,

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,040
it'll be bad for your cardiopulmonary functions.

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,950
Just do as I say. Run as hard as you can.

47
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,510
This will help you

48
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,510
sleep better.

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
Because you often

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
don't get enough sleep at night,

51
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,110
you always fall asleep

52
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,200
during the daytime

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,670
This will only keep

54
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,950
make your sleeping patterns even worse.

55
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,000
If you don't sleep well,

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
you'll easily run out of energy

57
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,260
and be in a bad mood.

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,700
I understand all that.

59
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,390
But can you carry on jogging?

60
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,040
I can't.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
I can't.

62
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,160
OK. Let's take a break.

63
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,830
You shouldn't stop immediately after jogging.

64
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,200
Come on. Let's walk.

65
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,110
Come on.

66
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,670
Ling Xiao,

67
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,510
are you sure you're OK?

68
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,040
Don't lie.

69
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,830
I just had a bad dream.

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,360
Why would I lie to you?

71
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,350
You know why.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,880
OK. Then promise you won't

73
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,070
misjudge me.

74
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,880
OK. Tell me what happened

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,760
when you were in Singapore.

76
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,640
Why did Auntie Chen Ting

77
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,790
let you come back?

78
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,550
From what I know about her,

79
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,480
she wouldn't

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,600
agree so easily.

81
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,159
Actually,

82
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,810
she withheld my passport.

83
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,100
You want to go back that badly?

84
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,390
It's here.

85
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,920
Everything is still there.

86
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,270
Where did you find it?

87
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,159
Mom told me to give it back to you.

88
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,550
I don't think she wants me to go back.

89
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,640
Why not?

90
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,800
Your heart is not here anymore.

91
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,270
You've even turned into

92
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,830
an expert of lies.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
You'll only get worse in the future.

94
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,230
Why would mom want

95
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,550
a bad son?

96
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
I'll take care of her.

97
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,330
You can just leave.

98
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,670
Live your own life.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,330
What are you looking at?

100
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,880
Look at you. The little kid has grown up.

101
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,230
You're crazy.

102
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,510
Mom just came back from grocery shopping.

103
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,710
You ask her yourself.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,830
Mom.

105
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,390
Have you booked your flight?

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,550
Not yet.

107
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,880
Then I'll cook quickly.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,760
Maybe you can finish your lunch here before you leave.

109
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,390
Mom,

110
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,600
you agree to let me go back?

111
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,480
You're grown up now.

112
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,200
I can keep your passport

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,000
for a couple of days,

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,670
but I can't keep you for your whole life, can I?

115
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,510
Besides,

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,510
Chengzi has spoken with me.

117
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
We've been a burden on you

118
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,350
for long enough.

119
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,350
I shouldn't force you to be by my side.

120
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,920
Why did you say that?

121
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
You talk too much.

122
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,600
Just help me cook.

123
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,920
Still looking at me, huh!

124
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
Alright, let's go.

125
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,520
Put up with it.

126
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,040
How did you get injured?

127
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,710
Let me see.

128
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,110
Before the other one had healed,

129
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,590
I got another knock.

130
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,320
You're so careless.

131
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,470
Hey, you've had bad luck lately.

132
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,440
Stay on guard.

133
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,030
That was nothing.

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
When I was in senior high school,

135
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,520
I even fell down

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,400
that long staircase

137
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,860
in the teaching building.

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,150
You fell down that long staircase

139
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,610
in the teaching building?

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,910
Holy smoke! You survived that?

141
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,080
What happened?

142
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,350
I just wanted to see

143
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,640
if I could jump four steps

144
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,590
in one go,

145
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,280
but I failed.

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,200
You were tempting fate!

147
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,030
I thought somebody pushed you.

148
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,200
No.

149
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,350
At the time,

150
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,520
I was afraid my dad would yell at me,

151
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,880
so I told Mingyue to go along with the lie

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,520
that somebody pushed me.

153
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,440
You fell yourself?

154
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,760
I thought that

155
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,160
Zhao Huaguang sent his friends to push you.

156
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,080
Zhao Huaguang?

157
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,710
Your dad?

158
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,710
Did he tell you that?

159
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,640
I asked him, but he didn't say no.

160
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,280
Why not?

161
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,710
Why would he be in a hurry

162
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,880
to take the blame?

163
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,590
So, at the time, you were afraid that

164
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,960
he would not only ruin the noodle restaurant

165
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
but also hurt Li Jianjian?

166
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,460
That's why you moved abroad with him?

167
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,590
Back then, Li Jianjian said that

168
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,990
she didn't see who did it,

169
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,670
and that spot was

170
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,110
wasn't covered by the surveillance cameras.

171
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,640
Afterward,

172
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,150
I thought about it carefully.

173
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,440
There was nothing he wouldn't do.

174
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,080
You know?

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,550
He had no problem ruining the noodle restaurant business

176
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,200
or going ahead

177
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,080
and beating people up.

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Wait a moment.

179
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,230
The noodle restaurant closed

180
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,690
because of Zhao Huaguang?

181
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,110
My dad said it was to be refurbished!

182
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,280
Imagine if you'd been told?

183
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,880
You would have tried to make him pay for it.

184
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
You knew about it too?

185
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm the only one in the family

186
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,710
who didn't know?

187
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,230
Something like that is suddenly exposed after all these years?

188
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,670
even a soap opera writer wouldn't dare make up

189
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,470
what goes on in your family.

190
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,140
[Treehole]

191
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,910
I have a massive problem.

192
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,080
The two brothers

193
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I grew up with

194
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,960
told me that they had feelings for me.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I helped Hongying

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,030
buy a massaging device,

197
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,520
and it's being delivered today.

198
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,320
So, I wanted to

199
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,520
drop by your restaurant.

200
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,790
Both of you are single, right?

201
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,590
Maybe you can be friends and get to know each other.

202
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,280
Yes.

203
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,550
You and I have already reached a certain age.

204
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,760
We've been through stuff.

205
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,620
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

206
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,670
I've been divorced for five years.

207
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,200
My two sons have graduated from university

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,260
and got great jobs.

209
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,710
Their dad will take care of

210
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,670
buying their houses, and I don't need to worry.

211
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,470
That's great!

212
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,150
She works as a teacher,

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,110
so she's very sensible.

214
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,080
Yes. Yes.

215
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,070
Being a teacher is great.

216
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,230
You deserve respect.

217
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,550
Thanks.

218
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,550
Mrs. Qian

219
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,790
has told me about you.

220
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,960
Your wife passed away 20 years ago,

221
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,200
and you haven't married again.

222
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
Not only do you raise your own child,

223
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,050
you also help your neighbor with their children.

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,670
They pay me living costs,

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,910
and I just cook for the children.

226
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,590
I know.

227
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,200
That woman cheated you of your money

228
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
and ran away,

229
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,080
but you still raised

230
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,910
her child.

231
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,280
Actually, out of the men

232
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,000
she's introduced me to,

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,880
a lot of them have very good conditions.

234
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,080
But personally,

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,720
I just want a good man.

236
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,440
Mrs. Qian,

237
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,840
she paid the money back already.

238
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Why do you still...

239
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,550
Don't try to help her hide this.

240
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Why would she give it back

241
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,590
after she took it?

242
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,000
She even abandon her child.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,330
Why would she repay you?

244
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,350
Zhu,

245
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,550
please get us some water.

246
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,150
OK.

247
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,440
Welcome.

248
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,960
Hi, I'd like to see Li Haichao.

249
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,790
Wh-

250
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,050
What brought you here?

251
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I was just passing by. I need to talk to you.

252
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,350
Do you have time?

253
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,030
Right now?

254
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,800
Right.

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,590
Yes.

256
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,440
Yes.

257
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,590
Zhu, take care of the restaurant.

258
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,400
Sorry, I need to go.

259
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,130
It's OK. Do you what you have to.

260
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,290
Let's go.

261
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,150
Why does she look

262
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,760
so familiar?

263
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
Where have I seen her before?

264
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,550
She looks pretty.

265
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,280
She is He Mei!

266
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,000
The children moved out to live with their classmates,

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,590
but they still

268
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,470
come back to see me every now and then,

269
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,110
so I still

270
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,440
keep the rooms for them.

271
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,880
Be seated.

272
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,590
I'll get you some

273
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,960
freshly marinated peanuts.

274
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,110
No, thanks.

275
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,470
There's something I just can't figure out,

276
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,530
so I came to ask you.

277
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,840
OK.

278
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,030
Go ahead.

279
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,770
From what I know about Zhao Huaguang,

280
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,170
he wouldn't have let Ziqiu come back.

281
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,400
Has Ziqiu said anything to you?

282
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,910
No.

283
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,760
He just said he came back to start a business.

284
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,230
He is grown up now.

285
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,370
If he insisted on coming back,

286
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,910
I don't think Zhao Huaguang could have stopped him.

287
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,230
If he couldn't stop him, he could still come and give you trouble.

288
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,890
Trouble...

289
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
Maybe I'm just paranoid.

290
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,230
But I can't help feeling that

291
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,230
Something's not right with

292
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,630
that jerk Zhao Huaguang.

293
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,310
By the way,

294
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,350
you must know that

295
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,350
the other day,

296
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,400
I went to Ziqiu's coffee shop

297
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
to see him, right?

298
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,640
He told me.

299
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,080
His coffee shop is

300
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
near a senior high school.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,530
I've checked the vicinity.

302
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,760
There were no malls or office buildings.

303
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,320
The road isn't wide, and there are no parking lots.

304
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,150
Whenever it's the school rush hour,

305
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,110
the cars to pick up the children

306
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,400
block the road.

307
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,110
Yes. There's a lot of people passing through.

308
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,810
But no one goes to his shop.

309
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,550
His customers are mainly the students.

310
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,960
I've checked his menu.

311
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,470
Only when an offer is on like half price

312
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,000
can the students afford it.

313
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,680
As soon as the offer ends,

314
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,520
they can't afford it again.

315
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,280
You're right.

316
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,200
His prices are high.

317
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,960
But Ziqiu's ingredients

318
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,280
are all top quality.

319
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,590
I don't know coffee. I don't.

320
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,350
But it smelled great.

321
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,670
He told me that

322
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,760
his coffee beans

323
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,620
are bought from

324
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,280
some sort of

325
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,000
chateau.

326
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,590
Yes. The cost is high.

327
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,110
I ran a rough estimation.

328
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,840
I don't think he can make ends meet.

329
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,520
He didn't tell me that.

330
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,470
I didn't know.

331
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,520
He's losing money?

332
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
Add this contact on your WeChat.

333
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,710
She's a female friend of mine,

334
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,510
a manager of a coffee shop chain.

335
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,590
She has agreed to

336
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,000
help him out.

337
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,150
I'll recommend her to you.

338
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,150
Then send the contact

339
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,030
to Ziqiu.

340
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,400
OK.

341
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,120
Tell him she's your friend.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,640
Come on,

343
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,550
if you want to help Ziqiu,

344
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,880
just tell him face-to-face.

345
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Why are you doing this

346
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,150
in such a round-about way?

347
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,080
I'm sticking my nose in here.

348
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,640
But for what I owe him,

349
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,109
I'll say he and I are even.

350
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,000
OK. That's all.

351
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,349
I've got to go.

352
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,800
Wait a second.

353
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,640
Children can't separate bones from the flesh

354
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,700
when they eat fish.

355
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,400
These are some fish balls I've made.

356
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,710
I've removed all the bones.

357
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,240
And there are no additives.

358
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
You can eat them without any worries.

359
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,410
Take it home for your child.

360
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't be so polite.

361
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
Come on. Take it.

362
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,310
Thank you.

363
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,680
Don't mention it.

364
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,790
I'll make more if he likes it.

365
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,760
I'll see you out.

366
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,190
Damned Tang Can

367
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,210
set Li Jianjian on me again!

368
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,280
Tang Can is busy today,

369
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,190
so she sent me.

370
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,950
Why do you want the household registration booklet page?

371
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,590
I need it.

372
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,590
Are you really going to look for a new house?

373
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,990
And I need my household registration booklet page to do that.

374
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,440
But still, I'll move out.

375
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,770
Why did you do that?

376
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,880
Have a seat.

377
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,120
I've ordered you a glass of coffee.

378
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,760
Stop messing about.

379
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,160
I have something urgent to do. Give it to me.

380
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,160
OK.

381
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,710
Let's talk. I'm listening.

382
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,560
Is it my fault

383
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,710
if someone likes?

384
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,040
I never said

385
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
it was your fault.

386
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,240
Everyone loves you.

387
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,570
It's my problem.

388
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,400
How is it

389
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,560
your problem?

390
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Of course it's my problem

391
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,800
if people don't like me.

392
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Who said that people don't like you?

393
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,920
That's nonsense.

394
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,160
Didn't you tell Tang Can

395
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,590
not to put yourself down

396
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,790
over a man's opinion?

397
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,110
Right.

398
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,160
Right now,

399
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,290
I can understand Tang Can pretty well.

400
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,660
It's really hard to love yourself

401
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,120
if the one you love doesn't return the feeling.

402
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Besides, if I moved in

403
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,190
and lived with you all,

404
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,470
wouldn't I be a joke

405
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,710
to all of you?

406
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,520
Why would you be a joke?

407
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,110
Why do you think

408
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,710
you'll be a joke to us?

409
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,230
Are we still real friends?

410
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,400
We are!

411
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,760
That's exactly why I need to

412
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,000
stay away from you all.

413
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
This is for all of us.

414
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,680
I...

415
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,310
I just feel so embarrassed.

416
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm mad at myself.

417
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,040
You should be mad at me.

418
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,190
I feel I really sorry about all this.

419
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,010
You have nothing to feel sorry about.

420
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,280
I just...

421
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,880
I just got mad at you when it wasn't your fault.

422
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,110
Then continue to be mad at me for that.

423
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,350
Don't move out.

424
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,430
My brother said that

425
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,890
he would apologize to you.

426
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,360
You're not a joke to anyone.

427
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,400
How about this?

428
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,640
You move back and live with them for a while.

429
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,560
And I'll move back

430
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,690
whenever you think it is appropriate.

431
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,190
You want to move out

432
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,850
in order to avoid your mother.

433
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,760
So, I'll move back to my home,

434
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,310
and you move back there.

435
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,310
Do you think

436
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,040
that I'm really unreasonable?

437
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,350
No.

438
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,040
But you're the only one

439
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,640
I dare be unreasonable with.

440

♫The setting sun hides the ray in the dark♫

441
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,190
Never mind. I give up.

442
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,590
I hate fighting

443

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,230
I always believe that

446
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,160
it's my fortune if I gain or my fate if I lose.

447
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,470
♫Filled up along the fissure by the moon♫

448
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,590
I'll go with my fate and stop forcing things to go my way.

449

♫The night sky doesn't have a reason to lose light anymore♫

♫So it keeps quiet♫

455

♫Unnecessary to say much♫

457
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,770
it'll still be really hard for me to face you all.

458
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,710
So, stop pushing me.

459

♫It just bears with everything♫

Where is Can now?

486
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,040
It's so late and she still hasn't shown up yet?

487
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,070
Stuck in traffic.

488
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,400
Sorry, I'm late.

489
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,800
I got caught in traffic.

490
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,110
Here is our superstar!

491
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
Superstar! Superstar!

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,710
Sit down.

493
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,070
Mom, happy birthday.

494
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,560
Can, we're all waiting for you.

495
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,710
Come. Sit down.

496
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,230
Hi everyone.

497
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,160
How are you?

498
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,350
Sit down.

499
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,640
Zhuang you've grown!

500
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,640
Superstar,

501
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,680
I want that Lego Iron Man.

502
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,710
How can you just ask for a toy

503
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,000
as soon as you see her?

504
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,430
He's just a silly kid.

505
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,520
They're close.

506
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,680
I'll buy you one.

507
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,920
Yan, you're here too?

508
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,660
You're on summer holiday now?

509
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,110
The curricula ended early, so I came back in advance.

510
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,800
I forgot to tell you not to buy a cake.

511
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
Auntie just bought one.

512
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,710
Give it here.

513
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,590
I hired someone to

514
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,920
tailor-make it for mom.

515
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,280
He learned abroad.

516
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,610
His cakes are very good.

517
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,110
Oh, mom,

518
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,430
I've also got you

519
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,470
a gift.

520
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,680
What a good daughter she is!

521
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,000
I mean, honestly,

522
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,230
I have everything I need.

523
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,280
I know.

524
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,190
That's why I made a bracelet

525
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,310
of red sandalwood beads

526
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,950
with my own hands for you.

527
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,210
Mom, I'll help you put it on.

528
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm wearing a bracelet.

529
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,250
Put it away for now.

530
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
Let's eat. Let's eat.

531
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I'll look after that.

532
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,760
Come on, Can.

533
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
Let's eat. Let's eat.

534
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,190
Be seated.

535
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,400
Yan, look at your cousin.

536
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,560
I'm not asking for the same treatment.

537
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,680
But don't upset me anymore, OK?

538
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,190
You want me to take my cousin as an example?

539
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,800
Then you should

540
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,160
take my aunt as your example.

541
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,470
Don't nag me all the time.

542
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,350
Look at your cousin.

543
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,310
She's working in a museum.

544
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Museum?

545
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
Come on.

546
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,120
Don't always nag your child.

547
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,560
Can, it's your mother's birthday today.

548
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,640
The entire family has gathered to celebrate.

549
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
So just be happy for your mother.

550
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,230
Come on. Cheers.

551
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,850
Happy birthday.

552
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,430
Thank you.

553
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,680
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

554
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,610
Happy birthday.

555
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,680
Thank you. Thank you.

556
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,190
Great.

557
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,710
Thank you.

558
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,800
Zhuang, eat as much as you want.

559
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,060
Eat as much as you want.

560
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,830
Oh, Can,

561
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,470
how much does the museum

562
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,600
pay you every month?

563
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,520
I don't know. Ask my mom.

564
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,680
Honestly, children...

565
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,310
Why not just tell your uncle

566
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,560
the answer?

567
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,350
It's not much.

568
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,800
But for a girl,

569
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,110
I think

570
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,280
the most important thing is a good environment.

571
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,680
Yes, yes.

572
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,110
Right?

573
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,640
Yes, yes.

574
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,920
A good environment is what she needs.

575
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
How could you

576
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,920
come right out and ask her about her salary?

577
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,250
What's wrong with that?

578
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,590
In my opinion,

579
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,770
Can should carry on being an actress.

580
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,680
How good was it when she was an actress!

581
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,110
Right.

582
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,830
You know, when she was little,

583
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,040
acting in dramas and commercials,

584
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
what a lot of money she made!

585
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,330
She bought a car and a house.

586
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,560
Everyone envied her!

587
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,470
Yes. Yes.

588
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,310
Cang Cang

589
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,590
used to love acting in commercials a lot when she was little.

590
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,880
She loved to act

591
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,650
whenever she saw a camera.

592
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,680
Afterwards, when she grew up,

593
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,640
for some reason,

594
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,830
her interests for the industry was gone.

595
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,000
But it was so tiring.

596
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,920
It pained us to see her like that, right?

597
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,710
Yeah.

598
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,320
As parents, I don't think

599
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,760
we should always push our children.

600
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,310
Yeah.

601
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,790
-Yeah.
-She's right.

602
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,830
Why are you staring at me?

603
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,760
I think you're completely right.

604
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,070
Absolutely correct.

605
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,950
But what a pity it is for Can

606
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,230
not to be an actress!

607
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,280
Back when you were in senior high school,

608
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,710
and fighting to be in that movie!

609
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,880
What a shame.

610
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,310
If you had gotten the role as the leading female,

611
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,000
you would be a star by now.

612
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,280
I saw on TV.

613
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,880
Working on a drama can

614
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
easily pay several million yuan.

615
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,070
Yeah.

616
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,000
Can, if you got popular,

617
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,590
would your parents need to

618
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,430
run that little supermarket

619
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,030
at the compound's entrance?

620
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,040
Don't always talk about money!

621
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,920
I think that money is the only thing on your minds.

622
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,430
And don't keep talking about the same thing to my cousin

623
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,630
whenever she's here.

624
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,590
If you want to be superstars so badly,

625
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,590
why don't you try?

626
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,430
If I had what it took to be a star,

627
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,560
I would have done it.

628
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,070
Had you not been so ugly,

629
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,190
when your auntie was

630
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,190
your cousin's manager,

631
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,190
I would have taken you to as a child star.

632
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,470
I'm glad that I was ugly.

633
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,470
I didn't need to be working so hard

634
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,070
and sacrifice my childhood.

635
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,280
Alright... Come on!

636
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,070
Let's eat.

637
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,520
Stop talking about such depressing stuff.

638
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,950
Come on.

639
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,760
Let's eat. Let's eat.

640
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
Don't keep dissing Yan.

641
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,430
Yan looks great.

642
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:33,950
Maybe in the future,

643
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,800
she'll become a star.

644
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,110
Yeah.

645
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,800
Right?

646
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,280
Can, you want to...

647
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,920
You need anything else?

648
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,260
What attitude is this?

649
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,350
I came out on leave.

650
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,530
I need to go back to the museum to work.

651
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,880
Don't throw sarcasm at me

652
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,350
when we've just met again.

653
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,280
You're mad at me?

654
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,640
If you hadn't started

655
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,280
that Taobao errand service

656
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,740
for your superstar dream,

657
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,400
would I have to

658
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,310
lie to the family and my friends

659
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,400
like that?

660
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,830
You think I'm not afraid of letting the cat out of the bag

661
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,280
and becoming embarrassed?

662
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Isn't this the dream you made for me?

663
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,760
When I was little, I wanted to be in dramas

664
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
not commercials.

665
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,070
But you just pushed me.

666
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,680
And now I want to continue with that,

667
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,920
but this is embarrassing you?

668
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,880
No?

669
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,470
You think they really feel that

670
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,520
you can be qualified to continue in the position of superstar?

671
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,920
From the bottom of their hearts,

672
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,190
they just think you're day-dreaming.

673
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,040
You know?

674
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,400
And, don't blame me for everything.

675
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,000
When you were little,

676
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,800
didn't you say

677
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,000
you wanted dad to

678
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,110
stop driving

679
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,040
and wished me to

680
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
quit being a cashier.

681
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,710
You wanted us to have a happy life.

682
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,190
Didn't you

683
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,520
say all that?

684
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,400
Yes, I did. I...

685
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,830
See?

686
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,760
Don't act like

687
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,230
we forced you.

688
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,160
Besides,

689
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Haven't I fought for you?

690
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
For that movie during senior high school,

691
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,920
you made it to the last two,

692
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,110
but you still failed.

693
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,760
Do you blame me

694
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,160
for your incompetence?

695
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,040
Cut it out.

696
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,760
Can is also upset about this.

697
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,590
Well. Stop!

698
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,800
You're just trying to comfort both sides.

699
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,400
Look at

700
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,310
your daughter now.

701
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,400
She's 26 years old

702
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
and still day-dreaming.

703
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,710
♫The setting sun hides the ray in the dark♫

704
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,310
Slow down! Slow down! Slow down!

705
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,680
♫But the stars don't sleep but unravel the darkness♫

706
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,190
♫Filled up along the fissure by the moon♫

707
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,400
♫The night sky doesn't have a reason to lose light anymore♫

708
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,920
♫If you ask it♫

709
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,560
♫About the story before dawn♫

710
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,400
♫It'll be all just the routine for the next day♫

711
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,280
♫So it keeps quiet♫

712
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,110
♫Unnecessary to say much♫

713
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,230
♫It just bears with everything♫

714
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,590
♫Looking back in despair every time♫

715
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,190
♫Having disheartened thoughts every time♫

716
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,230
♫It goes rough♫

717
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,190
♫How similar the night sky is to me!♫

718
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,110
It's all because of my silly idea.

719
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,700
I just thought that

720
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,110
a hand-made gift

721
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,830
would be better

722
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,560
than a gold necklace.

723
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,920
Moms

724
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,880
always have expectations for you.

725
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,230
It was your mother's birthday.

726
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,400
You should've just let things go her way

727
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
and made it easy for them.

728
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,590
Why did this escalate?

729
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,950
Haven't you quit the screen test?

730
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,230
Tell her that.

731
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
No.

732
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,040
And I don't think that

733
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,190
your Taobao service

734
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,880
is a long-term plan.

735
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,350
You should think about

736
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,560
the museum job

737
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,770
your dad mentioned.

738
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,760
No, I won't.

739
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,470
Miss Wrath, I'm serious.

740
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,190
I didn't agree with your idea of opening

741
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,450
a Taobao service shop in the first place.

742
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,670
You're so beautiful.

743
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,640
If you keep going out in that uniform

744
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
and you bump into

745
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,680
someone with evil intentions,

746
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,880
it'd be so dangerous!

747
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
So you'd blame the victim of a crime?

748
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,040
According to what you said,

749
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,760
a woman shouldn't even leave the home.

750
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,040
That's not what I meant.

751
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,590
Don't get me wrong.

752
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,590
Look.

753
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,230
Now, since you've decided

754
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,360
not to be an actress,

755
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,430
you don't need to

756
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,230
hone your acting skills in life.

757
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,950
And you don't need to

758
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,800
run an errand business.

759
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,040
You can sell goods.

760
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,350
So, you look down on me

761
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,560
for doing the errand service,

762
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,160
right?

763
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,760
Of course not.

764
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,680
That's what I got from your words.

765
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,950
You're doing great now.

766
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,310
Your work can be sold abroad.

767
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,000
You're making a better living than we all do.

768
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,920
You just lecture anybody now.

769
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,190
When you become an artist someday,

770
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,680
as a girl who still runs an errand shop,

771
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
will I still deserve to be your friend?

772
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,040
Are you crazy?

773
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,950
What have I done to you?

774
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,160
You even beat me with it!

775
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,760
Tang Can!

776
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,280
Li Jianjian, you beat me.

777
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,350
Why did you beat me?

778
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,520
How dare you beat back!

779
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,560
Are you crazy?

780
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,110
You're dead. I'm telling you.

781
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,350
You're so dead!

782
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,480
How dare you beat me!

783
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,320
You're crazy!

784
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,920
I... You're crazy!

785
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,000
You are crazy!

786
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,160
Are you crazy?

787
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,800
I... I...

788
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,350
You're crazy!

789
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,230
So unreasonable!

790
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,290
I'll beat you. I...

791
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,230
Why did you beat me?

792
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,090
Get out of here!

793
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,710
You all used to...

794
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,469
Father,

795
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,840
listen to this carefully.

796
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
Don't call me father.

797
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,080
This Master Qiu...

798
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,670
So I'm very grateful to him.

799
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,389
Had a fight with Qi Mingyue?

800
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,150
No.

801
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,190
What problems have you got with Tang Can this time?

802
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,120
She yelled at me.

803
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,360
About what?

804
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,840
She said I despised her for her job.

805
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,710
She even said that

806
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,840
when I become an artist,

807
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,699
she won't deserve to be my friend.

808
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,950
You're certainly not that kind of person.

809
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,800
Right!

810
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,320
How long have we been friends?

811
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,780
Doesn't she know me at all?

812
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,560
Don't take angry words

813
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,080
in a fight with a friend seriously.

814
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,910
I'll take a shower.

815
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,110
Let's go and have ice-cream after that.

816
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,600
Right now, I just can't

817
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,150
control my thoughts.

818
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,600
This is killing me!

819
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,900
How could she talk to me like that?

820
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,670
If she doesn't say sorry to me,

821
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm going to go mad tonight.

822
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,710
I think

823
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,710
if I do

824
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,950
one thing now,

825
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,200
I can then help you think.

826
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,320
That's impossible.

827
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,180
I'll never get over this tonight.

828
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,910
Then let me try.

829
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,230
♫Like a breeze♫

bury your head in the sand

848
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,490

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,470
♫All of this is love♫

858
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,430
Honey,

859
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,800
how about

860
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,470
some ten-pieces-per-catty abalones

861
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,190
steamed with minced garlic and glass noodles?

862
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,630
OK.

863
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,470
Shall we also order a dish of

864
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,520
Boston shrimps?

865
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I want small ones,

866
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,600
so that we can have a dish of steamed bass.

867
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm OK with anything.

868
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,710
Qi Mingyue,

869
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,280
can you please join me

870
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,410
in ordering dishes?

871
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,390
Am I your babysitter?

872
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,230
Mom, let's have a dish of scallops.

873
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,840
I just ordered abalones steamed with glass noodles

874
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
and now you want scallops?

875
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,300
Why don't you plan things?

876
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,470
You can only

877
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,670
order vegetable now.

878
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,470
Indian Lettuce then.

879
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,600
Do you have bok choy?

880
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,390
Yes, lady.

881
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,630
Then stir-fried bok choy please.

882
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:00,910
OK.

883
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,560
Thank you.

884
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,670
OK. Please wait.

885
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,530
You dad doesn't like Indian Lettuce.

886
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,690
You don't know that?

887
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,470
Dad, since when

888
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,000
have you stopped liking it?

889
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,320
Dad?

890
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,910
Yes, your mom is right.

891
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,520
Never mind all the rest,

892
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,270
I like him very much for this.

893
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,000
He listens to me all the time.

894
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,230
That's what you should look for in seeking a man.

895
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,870
His family conditions

896
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,950
are not important.

897
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,870
What matters

898
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,470
is his personality.

899
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
He doesn't fight you over anything.

900
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,890
Put down your phone.

901
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,660
Put it down.

902
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,430
Don't play deaf

903
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,690
whenever I talk to you.

904
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,120
Tell me.

905
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,840
Why didn't you answer Lu

906
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,040
when he messaged you?

907
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,840
I was busy.

908
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,190
You couldn't even

909
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,230
answer him?

910
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,360
I don't know what to talk about.

911
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,710
I have no feelings.

912
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,670
What about the one you have feelings for?

913
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,040
I thought you said

914
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,970
you would bring him home to show us.

915
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
You think you can fool me

916
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
with your parlor tricks,

917
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,050
like you have someone you love?

918
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,760
Can you ever lie ever since you were little?

919
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,430
He doesn't like me.

920
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,320
If I were him,

921
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,850
I wouldn't like you either.

922
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,040
Who doesn't check your professional background

923
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,700
when looking for a companion?

924
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,670
Look at your friend Tang Can.

925
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,760
She's already 26.

926
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,430
But she just walks around wasting time.

927
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,000
She's just

928
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,330
an idle useless person.

929
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,670
Mom, you can yell at me.

930
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,870
Why do you yell about Tang Can?

931
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,230
You've been hanging out with her all the time.

932
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,230
I fear that she will lead you astray.

933
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,320
You've always been

934
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,910
in a bad mood lately.

935
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,950
Is it

936
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,210
because I don't want you to go to Beijing?

937
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,800
Go to Beijing?

938
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,360
Why?

939
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,470
I talked to you about that the other day.

940
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,530
You didn't listen?

941
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,950
I'm old and got forgetful.

942
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,800
Your daughter

943
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,710
wanted to work in Beijing for two years.

944
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,440
I disagreed.

945
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,230
I think she should

946
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,710
quit her current job

947
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,430
and try to be a civil servant.

948
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,080
How great it would be to be a civil servant!

949
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,150
It'll give you security and lots of perks.

950
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,000
Look. Move back in with us

951
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,120
and prepare for

952
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,080
the civil servant exams.

953
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,040
Stop hanging around

954
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,840
with Tang Can.

955
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,800
Your mind is becoming wild.
