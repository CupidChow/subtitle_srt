00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,980
Episode 33

4
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
OK. That's all.

5
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,680
Thank you.

6
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,080
OK. Please wait a moment.

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
Every time you go out on a business trip,

8
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,979
your belly gets upset.

9
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's have something light today.

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,520
Why did you

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,640
pay the deposit

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,000
when I was on a business trip for a few days?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,840
Couldn't you wait for me to come back

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
and discuss it?

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,200
Haven't I called you to

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,120
discuss it?

17
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,610
I said, "We'll discuss it when I get back."

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
You didn't see

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,079
those people in the real estate marketing center.

20
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,680
This is a school district house.

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,640
Everyone wants a small-sized unit.

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Had I waited for you to come back to decide,

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,880
85-square units will already have been

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,600
sold out.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,560
Our family can't afford a bigger one,

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,079
like 120 square.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
After this meal, let's gather

28
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,480
the money.

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
We can't afford

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,000
the 85 square unit either.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
We've saved money for a lifetime,

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
and when we're about to retire,

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,560
you want to buy such a house.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,680
It'll be such a great burden.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,800
There are still years to go before retirement.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,880
Besides, the sum of our salaries

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
are not low.

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,880
We have our pensions for the retirement.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,079
I'm over 50 years old.

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
What if I get seriously sick?

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
What if I get cancer?

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Pooh!

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,200
It's impossible.

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,660
We're both in good health.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,840
Besides, we have physical examinations

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,640
every year.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
What if you or I

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,840
have an accident?

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,760
Qi Guoqing,

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,720
are you not going to stop acting like that?

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Mingyue is the only child we have.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
And you don't want to spend money on her?

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,080
But it has to be

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,480
something we can afford.

55
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Dad, Mom!

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,320
Mom, the house we live in now is

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,800
more than 140 square meters,

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,960
and it's enough for us.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,490
I really don't need a house.

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
But when you get married,

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,450
will you still live with us?

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
It's the man's job

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
to buy a house.

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,320
We have

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,520
raised our daughter so well,

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,000
and there's no need for us to buy a house as her dowry.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,520
That's so old-fashioned.

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,960
It's not a dowry.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
A girl must have

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,570
a house in her hands,

71
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,920
so she can be more secure.

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,680
Besides,

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,079
it's her premarital property. Do you understand?

74
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,140
It won't be a dowry.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
Mom, I really don't need you

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,160
to buy me a house

77
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
with your pension.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,160
This will put me under a lot of pressure.

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,760
What pressure will you have?

80
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm dealing with

81
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,200
the biggest pressure in your life right now.

82
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
The biggest pressure

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
in my life is...

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,560
Is...

85
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,010
As the Mingyue said,

86
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
transfer the deposit to others.

87
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Anyway, a small-sized school district house is very popular.

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,280
Qi Guoqing,

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,660
can't you understand what I mean?

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,650
Jin Yuxiang,

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,360
as long as you are happy,

92
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,040
you can do whatever you like,

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
but it's non-negotiable

94
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
if you want to buy a house

95
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,570
at all costs.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,330
I'll tell you this, too.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
I will buy the house!

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
If you don't want to buy it,

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,600
we'll divorce and split up our property.

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,930
I have to buy this house!

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,159
Dad, calm down.

102
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,360
Mom isn't serious.

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,080
Dad.

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,720
If you insist,

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,200
then divorce.

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,159
Dad! Dad!

107
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,760
Let him go.

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
He's being insane.

109
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,640
Sit down.

110
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,760
In fact,

111
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,640
this is what fathers are all about.

112
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,720
In this world,

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,880
only mothers really care

114
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,140
about their children!

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,200
Mom.

116
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Mom, you've gone too far.

117
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,360
In any case,

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,600
you can't use divorce to threaten dad.

119
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,920
I've been with him all my life.

120
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,380
You think I don't know him?

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
He wants to divorce me?

122
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
OK. As long as he really wants to,

123
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,180
I'll go to the Civil Affairs Bureau with him at any time.

124
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,960
Thank you.

125
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,490
All right, the food is here.

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,820
Let's eat without him.

127
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,120
Don't take what your father said seriously.

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
You still have me.

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,720
Well,

130
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,930
where is your family register?

131
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
I forgot it.

132
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,640
Look how forgetful

133
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,680
you are!

134
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
You two keep me worried all the time.

135
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,480
Mom, try this.

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
It's better to have a daughter, right?

137
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,760
A daughter always warms her parents' heart.

138
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
She knows you love it.

139
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,480
You eat some more too.

140
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,810
You still have work to do in the afternoon.

141
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Mr. Liu called.

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,800
He said while Can was at work yesterday,

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,720
the unmarried young men

144
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,840
of the museum

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,920
were very happy.

146
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
He said that they would make a promotional movie clip in the second half of the year

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
and he wants Can to take a part in it.

148
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
You look good

149
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,770
in this uniform.

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,490
It's just a uniform.

151
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,080
Keep this uniform on you.

152
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,200
It might be too late this year.

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,840
Next year,

154
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
take part in the civil service exam,

155
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,640
so as to

156
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,920
get a permanent position in the museum.

157
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,250
I'll think about it.

158
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,040
I didn't do very well in study before.

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
I don't know

160
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
if I can do it now.

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,960
You didn't study well

162
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
because you wasted your time

163
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
on commercials

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
and TV dramas.

165
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You have a good memory and you remember things quickly.

166
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,890
It'll be just a piece of cake

167
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
for you.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,040
Yes.

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,680
You don't

170
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,760
have to be a star.

171
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Besides,

172
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,560
you've already earned

173
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,020
two houses for us already.

174
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,210
We also bought a car.

175
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
We also have a little bit of saved money.

176
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
By running the small supermarket,

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
your father and I

178
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,880
can make enough money for ourselves.

179
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
You've kind of

180
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,920
taken good care of us.

181
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,840
Our family

182
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,920
doesn't have the luck to be rich.

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,080
This will do.

184
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Yes. This will do.

185
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,490
We should be contented.

186
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
And I don't have to

187
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,720
worry about you anymore.

188
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
If anyone asks me

189
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,540
what my daughter does,

190
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,800
I can answer them

191
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
with pride.

192
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
Stop it.

193
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Let her eat.

194
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,060
She still has work to do in the afternoon.

195
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,220
Hello, are you Sun Nian's mother?

196
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,320
You've taken me for someone else.

197
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Really?

198
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,920
Who are you?

199
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
My daughter is not married yet.

200
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,160
Stop your nonsense!

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Sorry. Sorry.

202
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,000
She looks

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,320
so similar to someone I know.

204
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
So I took her for someone else.

205
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,520
Sorry. Sorry.

206
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,440
Mom,

207
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,160
don't be angry.

208
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,160
I've closed up the shop already.

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,840
OK. OK.

210
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,900
From now on,

211
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,720
let's start over.

212
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,549
I'll listen to you.

213
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,000
From now on, I'll turn over a new leaf

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,909
and be someone better.

215
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,760
Good, good.

216
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
OK.

217
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,050
Your father and I

218
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,620
will be looking at you.

219
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,360
Good, good.

220
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,720
Eat. Eat.

221
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
My shoulders!

222
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll help you.

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,980
Don't touch me.

224
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,920
You just meet your new friends at the party.

225
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,380
Don't even come tomorrow.

226
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,720
Haven't I explained...

227
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,580
Don't touch me.

228
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,680
It was my roommates who dragged me there

229
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,080
to join them in the party.

230
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,280
I swear

231
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360
I just went to have a meal.

232
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,920
You also sang!

233
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,160
If I hadn't seen it

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
on your friend's Weibo,

235
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,920
you wouldn't have told me about it, would you?

236
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,320
I just sang for a while.

237
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,850
Just get out.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,460
Your presence bothers me.

239
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,650
When will you leave?

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,920
After Xiao takes his mother and sister

241
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,520
to the hotel,

242
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
he'll come and get me.

243
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Have you used Zhong Kui in "Honor of Kings"?

244
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,840
No.

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,840
I can't use his hooking skill well. What?

246
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
There is a line in it

247
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,080
that I think is very good.

248
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,120
Which one?

249
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
Garbage

250
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,490
should stay in the garbage can.

251
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,280
Not cool.

252
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,440
He's not garbage.

253
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,480
Not cool?

254
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
How is it not cool?

255
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,680
I just say a line

256
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,640
of the game.

257
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
What's wrong with that?

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,640
Whom have you

259
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,100
just labelled as garbage?

260
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,180
I don't want to talk to you.

261
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,140
So not cool!

262
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,680
Garbage…

263
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,480
Everyone is responsible for garbage sorting.

264
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Hi, can I help you?

265
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm looking for He Ziqiu.

266
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm here.

267
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,610
You're Chengzi?

268
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,800
Hi.

269
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,680
My brother said you made a birthday cake.

270
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,920
And my mother sent me to pick it up.

271
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,000
You don't have to come here to pick it up.

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
I'll bring it to him this evening.

273
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,860
No, thanks.

274
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,090
Give it to me.

275
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,880
Go inside

276
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,810
and get that double-layered cake.

277
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,600
Coffee?

278
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,490
How much?

279
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
It's on the house.

280
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,280
I mean how much the cake is.

281
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
It's also free of charge.

282
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,640
My mom said

283
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,850
I must pay for it.

284
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,770
After all, you're in business.

285
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,610
How much?

286
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,160
Then you go back and tell your mother that

287
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,490
I don't charge to make a cake for Ling Xiao.

288
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,680
Here. Hold stably.

289
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,600
My mother said

290
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,930
if you don't want it,

291
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,530
I can pay any amount.

292
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,060
Thank you for your coffee.

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,920
That's a lot.

294
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
It has changed a lot here.

295
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,120
And it's much better than before.

296
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,520
I don't even have to carry a bag when I go out.

297
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,280
I can just use my mobile phone

298
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,560
to pay for anything.

299
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,400
Yes, well,

300
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,840
nowhere is better than China.

301
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,570
We also have good public order.

302
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Today I went to Gulangyu.

303
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,520
I didn't expect

304
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,240
so many people to go there.

305
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,960
Fortunately, my son is thoughtful.

306
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,080
He rented a wheelchair

307
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,140
so I could sit in it.

308
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,400
Yes.

309
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,020
He's such a good child.

310
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,320
The food Haichao makes

311
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,780
is much better than these.

312
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,480
He always cooks for everyone's birthday,

313
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,000
and we celebrate at home.

314
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,680
It feels like

315
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
a waste of money.

316
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,920
It's not a waste of money

317
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,720
when it's spent on the children.

318
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,000
Isn't this what parental love is about?

319
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes, in the past,

320
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
we celebrated birthdays at home,

321
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,280
and I cooked.

322
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
The children like the food I cook.

323
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
But it's also great to eat in a restaurant.

324
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
The environment is good.

325
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
Look at the balloons and the lamps.

326
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,000
It's beautiful.

327
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,760
Dad, Ziqiu said he can't come.

328
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,640
Why not?

329
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,880
He said he had a temporary errand

330
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,800
in the hotel restaurant

331
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,680
and he had to work.

332
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,880
Didn't he say in the morning

333
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
he would bring the cake here?

334
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,680
I've got the cake.

335
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,440
It's in the restaurant's fridge.

336
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Would you like the waiter to bring it here now?

337
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,410
You brought it here?

338
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Yes.

339
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,000
I've paid for it.

340
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,760
No worries.

341
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,040
But...

342
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
I told her to.

343
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,800
It's not easy

344
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,120
for Ziqiu to run a shop.

345
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,490
We should pay for it.

346
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,180
Come on.

347
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,120
Help me stand up.

348
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,420
Are you going to the restroom?

349
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,850
You can sit down.

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,960
Haichao,

351
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,520
here is to you.

352
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
Be seated.

353
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,400
Listen to me.

354
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,160
In fact, in all these years,

355
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,880
I have a lot to tell you,

356
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,400
but I had no chance.

357
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,840
When I was young,

358
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,500
I did a lot of wrong things.

359
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
Of course, you know

360
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,280
all about our situation.

361
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,700
Ling Xiao's father

362
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,640
has always been too busy to take care of the family.

363
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,100
It's hard to raise a child.

364
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,040
It's quite demanding

365
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
and tiring to take good care of a child.

366
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
which needs more than

367
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
just some money.

368
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,360
So, I know

369
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,820
it's not been easy for you in all these years.

370
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,640
Ling Heping

371
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,370
doesn't take care of his child.

372
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,320
He used to leave the child to me.

373
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,050
After I left,

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,810
he left the child to you.

375
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,800
So, thanks to you,

376
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,200
Ling Xiao grew up

377
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,040
so well.

378
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
I owe you a lot.

379
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,880
Don't mention it.

380
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Over these years,

381
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,600
I see Ling Xiao as my own son.

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
You see him as your own son,

383
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
but he is not.

384
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,500
That's why I think you are a great man.

385
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,600
I really owe you a lot.

386
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,360
Come on. Thank you.

387
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,720
I can't drink.

388
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,120
So, I propose to toast with fruit juice, OK?

389
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,130
It's just about family.

390
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,690
It's just about family.

391
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Heping,

392
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,160
here is to you.

393
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Forget about me.

394
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,840
I've never taken care of you.

395
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,760
Why bother?

396
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,760
Forget it. Forget it.

397
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,880
Don't be upset.

398
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,480
You are

399
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,320
an indifferent father,

400
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,640
while I'm a burdensome mother.

401
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,760
Let's not

402
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,360
despise each other, OK?

403
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,440
I propose to toast,

404
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,080
mainly to tell you that

405
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,800
we as parents

406
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
should care more

407
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,200
about the child.

408
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,200
Of course, as the burdensome mother,

409
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
I should try

410
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,960
not to make more troubles for our son,

411
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,680
and try to take care of and help him as much as possible.

412
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Let's work together for this,

413
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
OK, Heping?

414
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,080
I love to hear that.

415
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,120
Care more about the child.

416
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,720
Don't make troubles for him.

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,560
Cheers.

418
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,840
Today is Ling Xiao's

419
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
27th birthday.

420
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,880
Thank you all.

421
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
Thank you for coming.

422
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,850
Oh, Chengzi,

423
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,240
get the cake here.

424
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,460
Let's start cutting the cake.

425
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,840
Son,

426
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,570
happy birthday.

427
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,410
Are you in love with my brother?

428
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,560
Didn't you see us

429
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,640
holding hands?

430
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
That doesn't mean you two are in love.

431
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,530
Are you in love with him?

432
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,360
Yes, we are.

433
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,800
You're wasting your time.

434
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,730
My mother doesn't like you anyway.

435
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,220
Did your mother tell you that?

436
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
I can see it myself.

437
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,020
What are you asking me about this for?

438
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Because I don't want you to

439
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
be my sister-in-law.

440
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
Whatever.

441
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,480
I don't care.

442
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,960
I mean I don't like you.

443
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,240
I don't like you very much either.

444
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,800
Thank you everyone.

445
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
See you later.

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,840
Be safe.

447
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,340
What do you think she mean by that?

448
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
It sounds like

449
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,080
she was claiming he was exclusively her son

450
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
and we took care

451
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,740
of her son for her these years.

452
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
She even had Chengzi pay

453
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,640
for the birthday cake

454
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Ziqiu made.

455
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,480
Exactly!

456
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,040
What was she doing?

457
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
How I'm worried

458
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,560
what Ziqiu is thinking!

459
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,040
Hurry and explain everything

460
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,880
to Ziqiu.

461
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,400
You get the car.

462
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Let's get Jianjian home.

463
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,720
OK. OK.

464
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
You said that

465
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,140
Chen Ting was very nice to you.

466
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,000
She was pretty polite.

467
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,610
Just because she was polite to you,

468
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,970
you thought she was nice to you?

469
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,040
Ziqiu told me to go home quickly.

470
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,360
I'll take a taxi up ahead.

471
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,840
You two go back by yourselves.

472
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,240
Don't make a detour. Bye.

473
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
Let's drive you home.

474
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,080
I've got to run.

475
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
Your uncle

476
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,280
will pick us up tomorrow morning.

477
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,760
So, we'll go straight back to our hometown.

478
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,080
You don't have to worry about us.

479
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,010
When will you return to Singapore?

480
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,380
I'll book you tickets in advance.

481
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
This time,

482
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,160
we have many relatives to visit.

483
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,920
It may take a while.

484
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,360
It'll take three to four days,

485
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
or five to six days.

486
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,860
You want to stay there so long?

487
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
What's the rush?

488
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
You've never been there,

489
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,560
so you don't know how much fun it is to be there.

490
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,960
Your uncle and I went fishing

491
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,600
with the fishing boat

492
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,920
when we were young.

493
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,240
We can fish at sea?

494
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,370
You're interested?

495
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,640
OK, I'll ask your uncle

496
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,700
to take you around.

497
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll book you

498
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,440
tickets for next Sunday.

499
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,160
OK.

500
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
Anyway, it'll bother you

501
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,520
if we stay here.

502
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
You can't wait to

503
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,360
book tickets for us

504
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,620
so you can get rid of us?

505
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm texting Ziqiu on WeChat.

506
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,740
He's asking me when I will be home.

507
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,680
You shouldn't have asked Chengzi

508
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,740
to pay for the cake.

509
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,720
I just think

510
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
it's not easy to

511
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,360
do business.

512
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,000
So let's not

513
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
give him extra burden.

514
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,320
Surprise!

515
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,680
Happy birthday!

516
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,640
Come on. Come on.

517
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
-Make a wish! -Make a wish!

518
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,440
Make a wish! Make a wish!

519
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,320
Your first wish must be

520
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,200
that I will be rich.

521
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,720
Come on.

522
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,480
OK.

523
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,520
My first wish,

524
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,060
Ziqiu will make a fortune.

525
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,240
My second wish, our family will be healthy.

526
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,200
My third wish,

527
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,480
the family will be safe.

528
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
Look at him.

529
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,880
How simple his wishes are!

530
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,920
I don't need simple wishes.

531
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm facing

532
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,520
a failure in starting the business, OK?

533
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,840
OK. Blow out the candles.

534
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,040
One, two, three!

535
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,440
Happy birthday to you.

536
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,400
Happy birthday to you.

537
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,440
Happy birthday to you.

538
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,640
Happy birthday to you.

539
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,440
OK. Get the plates.

540
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,560
I thought

541
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,420
you would be angry all night long!

542
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,410
There's no need.

543
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,360
I didn't go

544
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,240
because I was afraid

545
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,370
it might be awkward.

546
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,280
I'd rather the three of us

547
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,040
celebrate your birthday at home.

548
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,920
Actually,

549
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
thanks to Ms. Chen Ting,

550
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
we had a nice meal.

551
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,320
At least I had a good time.

552
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
You care about nothing but the food.

553
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,060
Don't pay me for this cake.

554
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,960
Give me back

555
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,680
the money for the previous cake.

556
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
You wish. It's 1,000 yuan.

557
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,890
That little girl is quite rich.

558
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,010
Come on. Let's cut the cake.

559
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,280
Try my skill.

560
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,170
You're going to love it.

561
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
♫Good night♫

562
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,160
♫Goodbye♫

563
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,720
♫My children♫

564
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,920
For a moment,

565
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,560
♫Maybe when you leave here♫

566
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
I felt clearly that

567
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,160
I had entered

568
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,960
the world of adults

569
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,920
♫Maybe on your way home♫

570
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,600
like my father's.

571
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,120
♫The road keeps getting longer♫

572
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,960
♫Walk slowly♫

573
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,040
The key to that world

574
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,920
is patience,

575
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,240
♫And don't look back♫

576
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,160
patience,

577
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,040
patience.

578
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,160
♫I'll be here♫

579
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,720
Simlock said that

580
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,960
the grass of patience is bitter,

581
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,040
♫Looking forward♫

582
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,320
but it will eventually bear

583
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,640
sweet and soft fruits.

584
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,320
♫With your shadow♫

585
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,880
My parents

586
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,640
had a big fight yesterday.

587
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,240
I don't want to make it worse.

588
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,960
What if your parents

589
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,400
get a divorce?

590
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,880
They didn't really

591
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
want to get a divorce.

592
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,320
But I've never seen my father

593
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,720
so angry.

594
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
My dad has a good temper.

595
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,370
I read researches on the Internet,

596
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,040
and they said that when men and women divorce,

597
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,370
men fight for the house,

598
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,050
but women for the children.

599
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Your father prefers money over you.

600
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
Of course,

601
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,720
one needs money to live.

602
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,280
But if my father doesn't

603
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,000
give my mother the money,

604
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
my mother can't do anything.

605
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,280
But you can't keep

606
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,540
avoiding it like this.

607
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
You either give in or fight.

608
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,400
I really have fought this time.

609
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,120
I didn't give her the family register.

610
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,450
You call this fighting?

611
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,800
It's in fact

612
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,880
still avoiding.

613
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,360
I didn't dare

614
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,040
to mention it yesterday.

615
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,560
Have you applied

616
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,760
for going to Beijing?

617
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,880
I just think

618
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,840
since my family is in a mess recently,

619
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,360
I want to

620
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
sort things out first.

621
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,020
Look at you.

622
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,760
Look at you.

623
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,960
The one who keeps telling me to fight

624
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,800
also compromised in the end.

625
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm not compromising with my parents.

626
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm compromising with fate.

627
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
Before I compromised,

628
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,680
I felt that

629
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,540
life was full of pits everywhere.

630
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,940
But after I did it, things became smooth.

631
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,960
My relationship with parents gets better.

632
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,880
No more confusion or pain.

633
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
I work a nine to five job

634
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,160
and take shifts, and the museum closes one day every week.

635
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,800
And I have time for the mask treatment like this.

636
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,360
Life is so good.

637
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,370
Li Jianjian.

638
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,520
You know what?

639
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,360
I've only worked in the museum for two days,

640
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,680
and someone started chasing me.

641
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,080
He's even a manager.

642
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,760
Li Jianjian.

643
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,650
Why are you so listless?

644
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,340
Is your stomach upset?

645
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,920
The meal that Ms. Chen Ting bought

646
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,680
is really hard to digest.

647
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Would you like to see a doctor?

648
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,560
No.

649
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,400
My body recovers fast

650
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
like a dog does.

651
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,650
I'm sure I can digest it.

652
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,520
I will endure it.

653
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,180
Don't make a fool of yourself.

654
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,720
Can you still eat the noodles with chutney

655
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,560
I ordered?

656
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,620
The winner does it.

657
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,680
There's not much to eat here.

658
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,400
Have some tea.

659
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,080
OK. Thank you.

660
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,280
Say whatever you want.

661
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,280
You can't just came here

662
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
to bring Dongdong something to eat.

663
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,360
I really came here to

664
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,220
bring Dongdong something to eat.

665
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,840
In fact,

666
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
in these two days,

667
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,040
because of you,

668
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I couldn't eat or sleep well.

669
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,160
Because of me?

670
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,760
It's not what you think.

671
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,330
It's not because of you.

672
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,320
No.

673
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,290
It is because of you, but...

674
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,400
Anyway...

675
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,560
It's not what you think.

676
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,360
OK. Take your time.

677
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,880
Look.

678
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,520
When we dated

679
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,600
while we were young,

680
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,800
we didn't

681
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,200
get a lot of chances

682
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,360
to talk,

683
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,200
so

684
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,760
maybe

685
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,780
we didn't know each other so well.

686
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,360
These years,

687
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,440
I always thought that you were

688
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
a selfish person,

689
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,480
but at least

690
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
you were frank.

691
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,040
Recently, I have

692
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,320
thought about it carefully.

693
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,800
I can't help feeling

694
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,930
that you've never been honest with me.

695
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,200
I remember you said

696
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,920
that you really loved Ziqiu.

697
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Then you shouldn't

698
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,680
have abandoned Ziqiu

699
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,000
just because

700
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
your life

701
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,160
was pretty hard

702
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,880
back then.

703
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,240
Then

704
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,480
why did you give birth to him in the first place?

705
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,320
Besides,

706
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,880
if you were

707
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,200
a selfish person,

708
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,240
you should have tried everything

709
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,960
to get Ziqiu back.

710
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
You shouldn't have pushed him away.

711
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,000
If you were selfish,

712
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
how would you have

713
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,040
taken care of

714
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,120
someone else's child

715
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,280
Dongdong

716
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,450
while you abandoned Ziqiu?

717
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,100
It doesn't make sense.

718
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,840
So I just

719
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,480
want to

720
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,260
ask you about it

721
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,560
today.

722
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,340
And I want you to tell me the truth.

723
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,660
You want the truth?

724
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,600
The truth.

725
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,560
Ms. Li,

726
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,960
take Dongdong

727
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,220
out to play for a while.

728
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,800
OK.

729
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,000
Dongdong, let's go outside.

730
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
Come. Let's go.

731
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,600
Alright, Aunt He Lan.

732
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,530
Don't see me off.

733
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,280
Well, your uncle

734
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
will be discharged from hospital two days later.

735
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,640
So, don't worry.

736
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,860
Don't push yourself too hard.

737
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,240
Making money is important,

738
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,520
but your health is more important.

739
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,160
OK, I got it.

740
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,120
Aunt He Lan, go back.

741
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,050
I'm leaving now.

742
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,960
I'd like to see you off.

743
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,460
Aunt He Lan, are you

744
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,980
short of money?

745
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,080
No, not at all.

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Then just say whatever you want.

747
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,080
Then

748
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
don't be annoyed

749
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
since you've asked me to say it.

750
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,080
I won't.

751
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,720
The other day,

752
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,040
your mother came here

753
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,170
to visit your uncle.

754
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
She should have come.

755
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,160
Uncle is ill.

756
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You've met her?

757
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes.

758
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,520
When was it?

759
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,780
Why didn't you tell me?

760
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
It's no big deal.

761
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,760
I met her a while ago.

762
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,880
She has built a new family

763
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,400
and has a son.

764
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,160
We won't see

765
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
each other again.

766
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,640
She's remarried?

767
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,040
She hasn't told me.

768
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
There's no need to tell you that.

769
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,520
Isn't it good

770
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,400
that we all live

771
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,010
our own separate lives?

772
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,400
In the past,

773
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,880
I always asked you

774
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,480
to be a good son to your father

775
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,620
and forget about your mother.

776
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,840
But as you know,

777
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,160
at that time, that was the best

778
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,640
for you,

779
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,060
and that was also your mother's wish.

780
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,610
I know you were doing it for my own good.

781
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,420
Didn't you always say that

782
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,880
after all,

783
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,280
I was not my dad's own son,

784
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,610
so it would make him unhappy

785
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,540
if I always thought about her.

786
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,260
It's not just that, Ziqiu.

787
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,730
Don't hate your mother.

788
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720
Your mother

789
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,040
had a really tough time.

790
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,100
Think about it.

791
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,200
She gave birth

792
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,560
to you.

793
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
So of course she loves you.

794
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
Do you remember

795
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,180
that in the past

796
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,760
when we spoke ill of your mother,

797
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,800
you were angry?

798
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,960
You would say,

799
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,780
"My mother loves me the most."

800
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,250
Do you remember?

801
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,240
Not very much.

802
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,040
Come on.

803
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,840
Your mother left you

804
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,200
after those.

805
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,040
Don't you remember

806
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,920
how your mother

807
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,380
took care of you back then?

808
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,360
Aunt He Lan,

809
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,880
why did you say this to me?

810
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,240
Didn't you ask me

811
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
to forget about her in the past?

812
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,040
But…

813
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
So you've really

814
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,160
forgot about her?

815
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,440
Why didn't you listen to me

816
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,900
like this on other things?

817
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,480
Your mother left you,

818
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,840
but

819
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,520
she really had no choice.

820
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,520
She is so stubborn

821
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
that she has never cried in front of others.

822
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,240
When she decided

823
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,520
to leave you to your father,

824
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,180
I went to see her in the prison.

825
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,000
Her eyes were swollen

826
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,040
like peaches.

827
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,600
She missed you so much

828
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,360
that she wrote to you every day,

829
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,820
but she dare not send them.

830
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,060
Aunt He Lan, what do you mean by

831
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,250
"went to see her in the prison"?

832
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,400
I should go back.

833
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,600
Aunt He Lan! Aunt He Lan!

834
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,620
Aunt He Lan,

835
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,679
when did my mother go to jail?

836
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,230
Please, tell me all about it.

837
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,880
Come out of there!

838
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,150
Calm down! Calm down!

839
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,080
I'm going to show you all...

840
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,630
Let's talk this through. Let's talk this through.

841
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,630
Get out of the way.

842
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,449
I will do anything if anyone dares make a move.

843
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,190
You're just allergic.

844
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,760
Would you like to go to the hospital to have some medicine prescribed first?

845
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,120
We'll compensate you

846
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,230
for the expenses then, OK?

847
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,560
I don't want your money!

848
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,670
No!

849
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,230
No! Don't do this!

850
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,230
No! Don't do this!

851
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,240
She was just allergic,

852
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,480
and I was just trying to help.

853
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,480
Who would have thought

854
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,140
that she and I were so unlucky.

855
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,060
She fell to the ground,

856
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,440
with the back of her head hitting the step,

857
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,520
and died.

858
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,880
At that time, having been to Shenzhen

859
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,540
for only less than two months,

860
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,540
instead of seeing a city full of opportunities,

861
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,050
I was sentenced to four years in prison

862
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,360
for involuntary manslaughter.

863
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,600
How could this

864
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,920
happen to you?

865
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,560
The police told me to inform my family members.

866
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,200
I must keep it from my mother.

867
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,840
So, I asked He Lan over in secret.

868
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,480
I was afraid that she might spill the beans,

869
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,280
so I wrote a letter

870
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,290
and asked her to bring it to you.

871
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,520
You sisters

872
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,560
have kept

873
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,720
such a big thing from me

874
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,840
so tightly!

875
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,840
If I had told the truth,

876
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,000
would you have adopted Ziqiu?

877
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Yes!

878
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,240
Of course.

879
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,680
I know.

880
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,040
So,

881
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,240
I did it for Ziqiu.

882
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
What has my child done wrong?

883
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,040
He was born without a father.

884
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,440
Later on, his mother

885
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,040
went to prison for murder.

886
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,280
Never mind our misfortune,

887
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,490
why did my child inherit this bad luck?

888
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,800
It's better to stay away from him

889
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,720
and let you take him in

890
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,680
as your own son.

891
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,160
And he can also take root

892
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,360
in your home.

893
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,880
It's better for him

894
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,160
to forget about me.

895
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,920
You want him to forget about you?

896
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,680
So you asked He Lan

897
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,960
to say those things to him,

898
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,640
right?

899
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,800
That's stupid of you.

900
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,280
You think it's for his own good

901
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,920
if you made Ziqiu believe

902
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,250
that you abandoned him?

903
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,960
I know it was a bad idea.

904
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,040
But

905
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,080
it was the best

906
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,320
I can do for him.

907
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,060
And you didn't have to worry about

908
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,080
wasting your time on him.

909
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,800
I took care of Ziqiu

910
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,960
not because

911
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,000
I want anything

912
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,000
from him

913
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,960
in return.

914
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,920
Just like raising my daughter,

915
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,320
I just want them to be happy and healthy.

916
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,240
That's all.

917
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,040
I don't want anything in return.

918
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,000
They always say

919
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,760
that I've raised Ziqiu very well,

920
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
but only I know

921
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
that he lacks one piece in his heart.

922
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,880
That one piece

923
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,280
is not something

924
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,000
that can be

925
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,960
made up for

926
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,490
with something delicious.

927
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,980
Only you can make up

928
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,690
for that missing one piece.

929
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,140
I'm afraid it'll remain that way for him.

930
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,370
No one can make it up for him.

931
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,840
What I can do for him in the future

932
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,810
is not to make any troubles for him.

933
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,440
I see.

934
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,290
I've always been

935
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
wondering

936
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,320
Who Ziqiu

937
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
takes after.

938
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,040
He acts on his own

939
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,360
and shoulders everything alone.

940
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,480
It doesn't make sense.

941
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,120
His mother

942
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,520
is a very free

943
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,720
and selfish person.

944
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,280
Now I see.

945
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,100
I didn't know you well.

946
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,620
He really takes after you.

947
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,360
He does?

948
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,080
If you think

949
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,200
you owe him,

950
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,810
you can make up for it

951
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,720
from now on.

952
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,960
Do as much as you can.

953
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,000
You're really a good person.

954
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,040
If it were someone else...

955
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,440
Never mind

956
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,610
what someone else would have done.

957
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,420
Ziqiu has the right to know the truth.

958
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,800
I'll call him now.

959
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Let me do it.

960
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,640
He Lan?

961
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,920
Ziqiu, you became a dirty little kitten again.

962
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,720
♫Raindrops rush through my windows♫

963

I will buy you a lot of delicious food.

Buns,

968
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,280

Aren't those what you want?

972
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Mom, what would you want?

973

♫It tells me how I can♫

Yes.

978
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,080
Anything!

979

♫It never speaks but answers with patter♫

be good,

982
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,920
and don't be naughty.

983
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,840
OK. I will keep that in mind.

lobsters and a big colored TV.
