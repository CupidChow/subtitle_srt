Episode 11

4
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Don't cry.

5
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,440
People around

6
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,970
thought I was bullying you.

7
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Sorry.

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,880
I just feel so bad.

9
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,520
Later,

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,079
you need to

11
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,720
take good care of Li Jianjian.

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
She's irritable,

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
not as stable as you.

14
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
Watch her more.

15
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,760
Okay.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,160
Don't worry.

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,560
After you leave,

18
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,440
I'll send you messages every time,

19
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,920
just as I did

20
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,400
as before.

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
Thank you.

22
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,640
Why did you say thanks?

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
Aren't we good friends?

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,680
Why did you say thanks?

25
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,120
If you can't

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,480
get used to meals there,

27
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,440
tell me.

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,160
I can send food to you.

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,060
You've said it many times.

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,880
No, we have to

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,040
tell him clearly.

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,360
He's getting late.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,690
Hurry up. Don't be late.

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,250
Hurry up.

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,250
Call me when you arrive.

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,079
Don't blame them.

37
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,480
I'll tell them.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,160
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
Take care

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
of yourselves at home.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
OK. I know.

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,490
Seat belt. Fasten it up.

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Drive slowly. Be careful.

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Or you see him off?

45
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,960
You, hurry up.

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,000
Bye.

47
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,930
Call me when you arrive.

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,450
Call me as soon as you get off the plane.

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,510
Jianjian.

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,970
Your second brother will leave tomorrow.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,340
Are you really not coming back to see him off?

52
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
What are you doing?

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
Why are you so stubborn ?

54
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
You are going to break up

55
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,810
with your two brothers?

56
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
You had maintained a close relationship with them for so many years.

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,800
Can you just break it off?

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,200
I beg you.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,600
Come back to see him off.

Then hurry up. Hurry up.

Hurry up.

Then you have to drive carefully.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,160

Dad.

85

When Li Jianjian comes back,

86
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
inform me.

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,159
I'll talk with her.

88

Okay.

Don't worry.

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
I guess it she will accept this after a couple of months.

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Dad, take care.

92

Dear students,

124
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,360
a new semester has begun.

125
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,000
Welcome you back to the campus.

126
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Let us join hands…

127
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
How is your summer vacation?

128
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Pretty good. How about you?

129
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,500
It's all right.

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,490
Here you are.

131
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,800
Study hard to make progress every day.

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,200
Mingyue.

133
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
Let us, with full enthusiasm

134
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,440
and abundant experience…

135
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,880
I miss you so much.

136
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Why did you spend an entire summer vacation

137
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,480
at your grandma's house?

138
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,800
You are tanned.

139
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,920
Don't mention it.

140
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,480
You know what?

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
A lot of my cousins

142
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
haunted me every day.

143
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
I just led them to play around.

144
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
That really fits you.

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You must have fun.

146
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,920
You know what,

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,280
it's fun to play on mountains!

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
I learned from my cousins

149
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,640
to make traps to catch pheasants and wild rabbits.

150
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Wow!

151
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,120
Moreover,

152
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,520
the bullfrog in the paddy field

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,280
is such big.

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,920
Don't talk about bullfrogs.

155
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
Have you contacted your brothers?

156
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,680
Did you call them?

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,970
What do you mean?

158
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
You really want to break up with them?

159
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,549
No.

160
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,419
Then why didn't you call them?

161
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,400
You can call them

162
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,330
if you miss them.

163
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,909
You can ask them

164
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,280
for their new phone numbers via QQ.

165
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
Is this serious?

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,030
You can't live together

167
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,960
as they go to college.

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
You even spent a whole summer vacation

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
in your grandma's house.

170
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
You are too naïve.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm naïve?

172
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,280
Yes.

173
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,840
Actually,

174
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,800
I feel sorry for your brother.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He is not willing.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,320
But he can't help it.

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,490
Although she didn't raise him,

178
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,040
she is his real mother.

179
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,160
No matter how unfeeling he said he was,

180
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
they are still families linked with blood.

181
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,440
In addition, he has

182
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,040
an underage younger sister.

183
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,740
He can only…

184
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,560
Tang Can.

185
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
Leading actress.

186
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
Tang Can. Leading actress.

187
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Tang Can.

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Leading actress.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Tang Can. Tang Can. Tang Can.

190
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,000
Tang Can, I saw the news.

191
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
Are you the leading actress now?

192
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,760
Not yet.

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,700
There is another competitor.

194
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Then when will

195
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
your play start to be shot?

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,040
October

197
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm waiting now

198
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,160
for the last news to enter the filming site.

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,120
Leading actress

200
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,520
is almost you, really.

201
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
I read the news about you.

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,440
The little girl next to you

203
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
is not as good as you.

204
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, exactly.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
Look has nothing to do

206
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,600
with the selection of roles.

207
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,320
The important thing is to fit the role.

208
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
Yeah.

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,080
Depending on look

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,200
is not professional at all.

211
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,800
Hey, why are you everywhere?

212
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,320
They won't use you

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,440
due to your look anyway.

214
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,080
Ugly.

215
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I will beat you.

216
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,680
I just watched Li Jianjian going out.

217
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,540
What happened?

218
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,280
Who knows what's wrong with her.

219
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,240
Just in front of the monitor,

220
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,440
she kicked the table.

221
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920

♫There has always been that rainbow♫

261

Little girl.

I'm off work.

263
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,440
You've been sitting back and forth for three times.

264
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,280
♫Flying with the love you gave me,♫

265
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,900
Your ticket is worthy.

266
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,700
Get off now.

267
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,160
♫I see myself with big wings♫

268
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh.

269
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,880
Thank you, sir.

270
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Li Jianjian.

271
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,410
What's wrong, Wang Doudou?

272
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
My mother said your second brother

273
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
went to study abroad?

274
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,880
His rich dad

275
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,840
recognized him?

276
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah.

277
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,480
And your brother

278
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,080
also went back to his mother?

279
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
I didn't expect it.

280
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,320
My mother used to say

281
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
it's risky to raise children

282
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
for other people.

283
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,220
You see now?

284
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,360
This time your family

285
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,440
gains nothing.

286
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
Watch your mouth.

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
Don't speak if you don't know what to say.

288
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
Why are you so fierce?

289
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,960
I just think

290
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,840
your two brothers have no conscience

291
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,880
and I feel sorry for you.

292
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,800
Why don't my two brothers

293
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,920
have a conscience?

294
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,520
They just went to study in colleges outside.

295
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,440
They'll be back after graduation.

296
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,300
You know nothing about my family.

297
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
I just think

298
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
they two have no conscience.

299
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,240
Zhu Bajie has gone to the college in the Northeast.

300
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,880
If I beat you now,

301
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,400
no one will come to protect you.

302
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,080
Your two brothers

303
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,840
leave you since ever.

304
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
No one is protecting you either.

305
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,820
Wang Doudou, do you want to be beaten?

306
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,240
Nope.

307
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
Don't be angry.

308
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,020
Leave me alone.

309
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,720
What are you mad at?

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I just asked you some tiny questions.

311
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,000
What are you mad at?

312
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,000
How many points

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,800
did you score this time?

314
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
Shut up.

315
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,120
Tell me.

316
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Mom.

317
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,360
Mrs. Qian.

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
Hey, Doudou.

319
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Mrs. Qian, Mrs. Wang.

320
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,020
Why are you back together?

321
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,010
We just came across each other.

322
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,080
Jianjian.

323
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,880
I heard

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,760
your brothers

325
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,400
both returned to their families?

326
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,530
Do you still connect them on the phone?

327
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,200
Yes.

328
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
They are still conscientious.

329
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,000
Otherwise, it's really meaningless to raise them.

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,120
They just separated now.

331
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
So they are still close.

332
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,240
Later,

333
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
when they work after graduation,

334
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,040
if they can go back to take care of them,

335
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
they will be really conscientious.

336
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,320
Jianjian,

337
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,920
you grew up with them together.

338
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,850
Do you miss them?

339
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
Ah, well,

340
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,360
my dad is urging me to have dinner home.

341
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,960
I have to go.

342
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,200
Goodbye, granny. Goodbye, Mrs. Wang.

343
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
Oh, okay, goodbye.

344
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,480
Well, I have to go too.

345
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,400
I have to go home to cook.

346
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Okay.

347
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Bye, Mrs. Qian.

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,640
Oh, bye.

349
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,960
Let me make you some good food.

350
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I want to eat meat.

351
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,560
Can you handle it?

352
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,280
Good then.

353
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,040
You know,

354
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,760
your mom is inconvenient to move now.

355
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,400
She must be emotionally unstable.

356
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,440
You always have to give in to her.

357
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,500
Jian-Jianjian, you are back.

358
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Jianjian is back.

359
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,680
Hold on.

360
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,680
Your brother is on phone.

361
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,440
Hold on.

362
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,400
She is changing shoes.

363
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You, you, you hold on. Don't hang up.

364
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,560
Hey, Jianjian.

365
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,800
Jianjian.

366
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
She rushes to the toilet.

367
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,320
You know

368
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,180
her temper too.

369
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,600
Ah?

370
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,100
OK, let's talk later. Go take care of your business.

371
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,760
Bye.

372
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
Oh, I'm starving.

373
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,120
What are we going to eat today?

374
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
Li Jianjian.

375
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,240
Sit down.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,520
Why are you so fierce?

377
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,970
What do you want?

378
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,640
Ah?

379
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,520
Are you planning to

380
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,800
break off with your two brothers forever?

381
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,530
You didn't answer their calls.

382
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
You grew up

383
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,330
together since childhood.

384
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
You have to cherish

385
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
your friendship.

386
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,360
Do you know?

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,720
You even said "cherish."

388
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,840
Oh, is it that serious?

389
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,740
You,

390
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,400
You stubborn…

391
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,060
Put it down!

392
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm talking to you seriously.

393
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,820
Be serious.

394
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
Okay.

395
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
Go ahead, boss.

396
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,310
Tell me.

397
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,839
What exactly do you want?

398
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,800
I want nothing.

399
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I just want

400
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,720
neighbour's not to

401
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,640
always laugh at you

402
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
for raise them in vain when they meet me.

403
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,560
I just want

404
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,020
my classmates and friends

405
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,640
not to always mention me that

406
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,480
I used to have brothers

407
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,960
when they see me.

408
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,920
I just want to re-adapt to

409
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
the life of the only-child family.

410
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,400
I just want,

411
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
I want,

412
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,640
I want my world to be silent.

413
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,400
Don't, don't hurry.

414
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Speak slowly.

415
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,840
How about you peel while talking?

416
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,560
Dad.

417
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,320
I am not angry with

418
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,360
them as they left to study

419
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,690
abroad or in Singapore.

420
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,320
I just,

421
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,690
I understand through this matter that

422
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,320
they actually

423
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
have nothing to do

424
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,920
with our family.

425
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
If one day one of us

426
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,760
becomes unconscious and waits for an operation,

427
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,640
they will not even be qualified

428
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,040
to sign the consent form for the operation.

429
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,120
You…

430
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
You called them brothers

431
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
for so many years.

432
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,970
That doesn't count?

433
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
Although they are brothers,

434
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,860
they are not my real brothers.

435
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,760
Till now,

436
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,640
I finally understand

437
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
our previous thought

438
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,200
was too naïve.

439
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
Taking those who have a good relationship with us as families

440
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,480
is just like children's game

441
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
of Playing House.

442
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Your brothers

443
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,840
must be heartbroken

444
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,170
if they hear your words.

445
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,440
You know best in your hearts

446
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,370
whether they are good to you or not.

447
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,410
Your second brother

448
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,680
always left everything delicious to you,

449
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,920
protected you everywhere

450
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,320
and took the blame for you

451
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
without any complaints.

452
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,540
And your first brother

453
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,880
always tried his best to care about you.

454
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
I won't list other examples.

455
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,370
During your growth,

456
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
he always sent you

457
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,840
to continuation class every time on weekends

458
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,170
without missing a time.

459
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
How many real brothers

460
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
can be as good

461
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,320
as them?

462
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,320
Jianjian,

463
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
tell me honestly.

464
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Do you think it's a good thing

465
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,580
for your second brother to study abroad?

466
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
It's a good thing.

467
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,440
It's a good thing.

468
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,160
He just wants to save money

469
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
and save his tuition for our family.

470
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,920
Besides, he can go abroad to learn

471
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,400
what he wants to learn.

472
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,640
Of course it is a good thing.

473
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,080
Then does your first brother want to

474
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,400
go to Singapore?

475
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,460
That's because his real mother is there.

476
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,560
What can he do

477
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,060
to his real mother?

478
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,370
What other choice does he have?

479
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,640
Jianjian,

480
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,400
just like me and your mother

481
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,760
who formed a family,

482
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
you will also

483
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,160
form your own family

484
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,260
and leave me in the future.

485
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,560
But this does not mean

486
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,090
we are not a family anymore.

487
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,600
It doesn't mean

488
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
we don't care about each other any more.

489
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,370
The hearts of real families

490
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,160
are always together

491
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,880
wherever they are.

492
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,840
But I don't want them to leave.

493
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,960
I don't want them to leave.

494
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Who wants to let them leave?

495
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,840
When young,

496
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,170
we never thought of separation

497
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,920
but always felt that time was very slow,

498
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,840
very slow.

499
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,180
We were always worried

500
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,080
when we could grow up.

501
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
But time

502
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,960
is lost

503
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,520
on the white paper in the class when we were absent-minded

504
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
in a moment of joy,

505
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,480
or in tears.

506
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,480
At any time,

507
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,640
there is an invisible hand

508
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,960
that is leading us.

509
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,240
It is silent,

510
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,360
but it never stops.

511
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,200
Happy New Year.

512
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,850
Time passes year after year

513
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,160
in the blink of an eye,

514
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,560
but it's so similar,

515
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,960
dull

516
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,060
without any fluctuation.

517
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,840
But it just quietly changes.

518
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,640
Good things come in pairs.

519
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,120
Wish you luck and a fortune in four seasons.

520
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,040
Give me the red envelope.

521
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

522
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,000
Wish you progress in study.

523
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Thanks, Mr. Ling.

524
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,690
May you smoothness.

525
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,480
May you blooming business

526
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,640
every day.

527
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,520
I love to hear this.

528
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,690
Here you are.

529
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,320
Dad, give me the red envelope.

530
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
Come and have a piece of meat.

531
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm rich.

532
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Hey, Mr. Li.

533
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,040
Happy New Year.

534
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,840
Yes. We are watching the Spring Festival Gala.

535
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,170
We are watching the Spring Festival Gala.

536
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,920
Then

537
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,320
we work hard

538
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,280
to stop time changing us.

539
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,690
Brother, second brother, Happy New Year.

540
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,020
Happy New Year.

541
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,920
Ziqiu.

542
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,180
Are you in the park?

543
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,260
Happy New Year.

544
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,690
What did you say?

545
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,480
Ah, yes.

546
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,700
I'm in the park.

547
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,840
There is no taste of New Year at all.

548
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
Have you eaten New Year's Eve dinner?

549
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,640
We are eating.

550
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,240
Dad is calling others for New Year greeting.

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,640
Mr. Ling is watching that sketch

552
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
of the Spring Festival Gala.

553
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll call him for you.

554
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,480
Mr. Ling.

555
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,040
Yes?

556
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,360
I'm video calling with brother.

557
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,160
Come here.

558
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,160
Okay.

559
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,530
Coming, coming.

560
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,320
Hey, Ziqiu.

561
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Ling Xiao.

562
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,180
Happy New Year.

563
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,970
Dad, Happy New Year.

564
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,320
Happy New Year.

565
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,000
Hey, Ziqiu?

566
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
His internet is not good.

567
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,760
Mr. Ling, Happy New Year.

568
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,800
Ah the signal is not so good.

569
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,760
It's always stuck.

570
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,200
Happy,

571
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,320
Happy New Year.

572
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,120
It's okay.

573
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,250
It's good to see you.

574
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,520
Why are you both losing weight?

575
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,040
Eat more meat.

576
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,920
Heping.

577
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Your phone rings.

578
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,920
Oh, coming.

579
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,920
Okay.

580
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,140
Then you guys talk.

581
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,210
I'm going to make calls.

582
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,320
How nice.

583
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,520
Once it comes to six o'clock,

584
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,400
their phones

585
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,680
keep ringing.

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,840
What did you eat for

587
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,370
your New Year's Eve dinner?

588
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
I ordered dishes from the restaurant.

589
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,720
But

590
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,200
they are not as delicious as those cooked by Mr. Li.

591
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Of course.

592
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,080
Oh, I've been stuck here.

593
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,920
Damn signal.

594
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,680
What did you eat tonight?

595
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,160
Can you find a place

596
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,560
with better signal?

597
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,480
We talked about this topic just now.

598
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,610
You are always late.

599
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
Didn't you go to Zhao Huaguang's house to celebrate the New Year?

600
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
Why must I go to Zhao Huaguang's house?

601
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't have anything to talk with him

602
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,120
or his wife.

603
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,920
We fight as soon as we meet.

604
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,520
By the way,

605
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,680
we overseas students

606
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,720
will have a celebration tonight.

607
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,240
We'll make dumplings

608
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
together.

609
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,200
We don't make dumplings

610
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,000
to celebrate the New Year at home.

611
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,530
He makes dumplings abroad.

612
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,820
Your signal is really so weak!

613
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,620
What are you doing these two days?

614
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,520
I'll go to grandma's home with dad tomorrow.

615
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,440
On the second day, we'll go to my maternal grandma's home.

616
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,320
On the third day, we'll visit relatives.

617
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,360
On the fourth day, relatives will visit us at home.

618
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
I told dad

619
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,960
we can have a meal

620
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,200
in a restaurant.

621
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
He said he's a chef

622
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,000
and it's not good to dine outside.

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,360
He insisted cooking.

624
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,400
As you know,

625
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,280
we have so many

626
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,440
kid relatives.

627
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,500
They always want me to play with them.

628
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,000
You're also a kid.

629
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
Don't say such words.

630
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,720
Forget it.

631
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
My signal is too weak.

632
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,120
I'll call dad

633
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,380
when I go back tonight.

634
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,120
I'm going off line.

635
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,380
Bye.

636
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,560
Okay.

637
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,160
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

638
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,890
Bye-bye.

639
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,080
We tried hard to

640
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,560
express our care.

641
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
We tried hard

642
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,760
to shorten the distance.

643
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,720
Why do you keep smiling at me?

644
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,880
I'm happy to

645
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,920
see you.

646
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
Annoying.

647
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,480
Well, by the way,

648
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
the pineapple tart you sent back

649
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,960
is so delicious.

650
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Thank you so much.

651
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,680
I've given Qi Mingyue

652
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,360
her portion as you asked.

653
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,420
She said thank you.

654
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,580
If you really want to thank me,

655
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,920
then

656
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,480
act like a spoiled child.

657
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm not a spoiled child.

658
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
Brother, what are you doing?

659
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,680
Well, I'm having a video call.

660
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,640
Go out and play.

661
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,480
No.

662
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,320
I don't want to eat alone.

663
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,360
Go.

664
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,400
It doesn't matter.

665
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,560
Just go. Go.

666
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,600
Li Jianjian?

667
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
What are you talking to my brother for?

668
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He's my brother,

669
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,960
not yours.

670
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,720
It's rude of you to say that. Apologize.

671
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Sorry.

672
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,400
Let's go.

673
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
Let's go to eat.

674
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,800
Go.

675
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,400
Don't be mad.

676
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,640
She's just a kid.

677
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,520
I'm going to eat.

678
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,200
When Ziqiu comes back to his dorm,

679
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,530
I'll contact you again.

680
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,410
Okay.

681
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,440
I haven't finished dinner either.

682
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,480
I'm going too.

683
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,610
I'm going to hang up.

684
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,200
Go.

685
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Bye-bye.

686
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,040
Bye-bye.

687
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,160
Let's eat.

688
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,600
We all tried hard,

689
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,800
tried hard

690
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,560
to fight against time

691
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,520
and distance.

692
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,400
Jianjian,

693
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,420
come over here.

694
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,240
Your cousin wants to talk to you.

695
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,640
Coming.

696
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,640
In 2012,

697
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
when I was admitted to the local university

698
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,780
for sculpture study as an exception,

699
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,400
my brother suspended schooling

700
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,160
in order to look after his mother.

701
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,760
Ziqiu also became very busy.

702
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
What my dad had said

703
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,210
were being verified one by one.

704
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,520
He said

705
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,920
adults should be busy.

706
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,440
Dad,

707
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,570
I've been at school.

708
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,360
Don't worry.

709
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,560
I'm not going abroad.

710
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
Okay, okay.

711
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm not going back

712
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,810
for lunch today.

713
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Okay, bye-bye.

714
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
Congratulations to our college student

715
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,400
on going to school today.

716
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
No early love.

717
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm already 18.

718
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,170
It should not be early love.

719
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,360
You made fewer calls recently.

720
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,440
Is your mom…

721
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,480
Thanks. I got it.

722
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,360
After going to college,

723
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
I realized that

724
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,000
one would lead an easier life in college

725
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,320
was just a lie.

726
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,480
I became very busy.

727
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
Besides the classes,

728
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,120
I had a lot of homework to do.

729
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,920
How are you doing recently?

730
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Is everything going well at school?

731
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,160
And time seemed to

732
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,280
suddenly awake,

733
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
as if it were in a hurry to somewhere.

734
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,880
It led us ahead

735
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
and before we reacted,

736
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,330
more than two years had passed.

737
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,040
In this year when

738
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
I and my brother were junior,

739
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
Ziqiu graduated.

740
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,840
But,

741
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,570
he hadn't come back.

742
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,840
Well…

743
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,840
Why do you want to

744
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
make dessert suddenly?

745
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,080
It's mainly because

746
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
I think it's interesting to

747
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,280
make dessert.

748
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
And,

749
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,520
because of my major,

750
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,000
I have to go to Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou

751
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,040
to get a good job.

752
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,800
But I only want to

753
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,640
develop in our hometown

754
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,800
after graduation.

755
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,200
I can get good development by learning dessert.

756
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,680
Dad,

757
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,120
sorry.

758
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,690
I promised to go back

759
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,100
right after graduation, but…

760
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,500
It doesn't matter.

761
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,920
Just focus on your learning.

762
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,480
Well, dad,

763
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,520
why doesn't Li Jianjian speak?

764
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,600
Is she mad?

765
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,560
Hello.

766
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,000
Why am I mad?

767
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,180
It's good for you to learn a new skill.

768
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,680
As you like it,

769
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,920
just learn it.

770
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,440
I need to enjoy the noodles.

771
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,970
I have to go to school later.

772
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh. Okay.

773
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,640
It's good that you're not mad.

774
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,700
You think too much.

775
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,080
Jianjian is busy

776
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,940
helping her senior

777
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,120
with her

778
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,560
graduation design exhibition.

779
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,900
She's even too busy to have meals.

780
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,080
Okay.

781
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,560
Dad, take care.

782
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Ask Li Jianjian to have meals on time.

783
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,440
Okay.

784
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,880
You should also have meals on time.

785
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
I'm gonna hang up.

786
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
Bye-bye.

787
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,880
Jianjian.

788
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,960
Dad,

789
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,920
I have to go.

790
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,380
They had urged me just now.

791
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,560
I'm going, bye.

792
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,240
Be careful on the way.

793
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,040
I got it.

794
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,160
Someday,

795
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,440
I suddenly found

796
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,760
separation

797
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,360
was normal in life.

798
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
Just like a dandelion seed,

799
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
where it flew to,

800
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,240
where it would grow.

801
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,160
It'd have new land,

802
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,680
new friends

803
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,920
and new dreams.

804
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,880
I made it.

805
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
It's too sweet.

806
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,120
It looks appetizing.

807
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,960
When you come back…

808
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,360
Amazing.

809
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,240
Great.

810
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,680
Gradually,

811
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,600
because of separation,

812
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,000
we became distant

813
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,160
and didn't talk a lot

814
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,100
no matter how much we cared about each other.

815
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,600
It's your son.

816
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,760
He wants you. You talk to him.

817
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
You talk to him. Don't you miss him?

818
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,040
Son.

819
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Dad,

820
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,640
are you with Li Jianjian?

821
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes.

822
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,320
We're having dinner.

823
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,040
Mr. Ling misses you.

824
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,800
How's your mom?

825
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,920
She can stand up

826
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,200
without auxiliary tools recently.

827
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,880
She has made great progress

828
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,040
and she's in good mental state.

829
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,400
Oh.

830
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,130
Well.

831
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,400
Do you send and pick up

832
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,660
your sister every day?

833
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,560
She can help

834
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,880
with the housework now.

835
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,960
That's great.

836
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,080
In that case, you'll lead an easier life.

837
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,480
How are you doing lately?

838
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,160
I'm doing well.

839
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,640
But Mr. Li is annoyed with

840
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
Jianjian.

841
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,720
He thinks she should go out to play

842
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,080
instead of staying at home

843
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,520
in summer vacation.

844
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,240
Rarely, she went to her grandma's home,

845
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,160
but she came back

846
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,220
in less than a week.

847
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,920
I went there for sketching,

848
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
but those kids haunted me every day

849
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,560
and even tore my drawings.

850
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I was so annoyed.

851
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,220
Look at her.

852
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
She still acts like a boy.

853
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,360
Dad,

854
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,660
where's Jianjian?

855
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,660
He wants to talk to you.

856
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm eating.

857
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,640
What's up?

858
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,920
Did you make any boyfriend

859
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,280
in secret recently?

860
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,120
Where could I get a boyfriend?

861
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,200
You think too much.

862
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,920
You're still young.

863
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,760
You should put your study first.

864
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,420
Do you know?

865
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,360
I know.

866
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,710
Son,

867
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,620
take care of yourself.

868
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,730
When you have time,

869
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,840
remember to call me.

870
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,760
Don't worry about me.

871
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,620
I'm quite good.

872
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,370
Oh, well.

873
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,920
Would you like to say hello

874
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,670
to Mr. Li?

875
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,449
He's making dishes in the kitchen.

876
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,600
Oh, no need.

877
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Send my greetings to him.

878
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,800
If there's nothing else,

879
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,600
just hang up.

880
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,150
Bye-bye.

881
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,320
He hung up so fast.

882
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,810
Well, Jianjian.

883
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,150
What do you usually talk

884
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,840
on the phone

885
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,000
with Ling Xiao?

886
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,080
Nothing important.

887
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,440
We don't have

888
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,900
anything special to talk.

889
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,320
We just make sure each other is still alive.

890
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,720
Well,

891
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
my son doesn't often call me.

892
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
But when

893
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,520
he calls,

894
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
I don't have much

895
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
to say to him.

896
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,000
Why can your dad

897
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,720
talk so much

898
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,440
when he calls your brothers?

899
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,960
He has a lot to say

900
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,840
and the call

901
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,800
lasts so long.

902
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,920
Don't you think

903
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,520
he's like a mother

904
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,800
in this family?

905
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,920
He is.

906
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,480
Yeah, yeah.

907
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,520
Is he a fool?

908
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,760
Who sent you message?

909
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,680
My mom.

910
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,820
Where's the photo?

911
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,640
What are you doing? You're taking photo of me!

912
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,800
Delete it. Delete it.

913
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,560
It's so ugly.

914
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,200
It's good. You're so cute.

915
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,000
Be good.

916
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
I'll tell my mom I'm with you.

917
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,720
Be good.

918
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,480
Annoying.

919
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
It's a latest photo.

920
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,800
Lovely.

921
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,440
Are you in love?

922
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,720
No, I'm not.

923
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,850
Who am I in love with?

924
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,970
Why do you always check your phone?

925
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's strange.

926
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,800
No, I'm not in love.

927
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,920
Besides,

928
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,600
if I'm in love,

929
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,130
I will definitely tell you.

930
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,160
Yeah.

931
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,120
Are you in love?

932
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,080
Of course no.

933
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,210
Who am I in love with?

934
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,080
Besides,

935
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,640
if I'm in love,

936
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,170
I will definitely tell you.

937
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
Yeah.

938
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,600
Do not fall in love.

939
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,440
Vows of eternal love are unreliable.

940
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,800
We should focus on our career first.

941
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,440
It's boring to fall in love.

942
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm going to open

943
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,560
a studio

944
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,600
with a senior close to me

945
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,640
after graduation next year.

946
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,840
We've agreed on that.

947
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,480
Who?

948
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,360
Du Juan.

949
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I told you before.

950
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,840
Oh.

951
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,680
Yeah.

952
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,120
Replay it a little bit.

953
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,580
I didn't watch it just now.

954
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,480
Come on.

955
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,720
After graduation,

956
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,380
I opened a woodcarving studio

957
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,160
named Gap of Time

958
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,960
with my senior Du Juan.

959
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,280
We humans seemed to

960
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,210
have been caught in the gap of time,

961
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
struggling to survive for a moment.

962
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,600
Though I couldn't be

963
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,760
an artist,

964
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,480
a person with good skills

965
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
wouldn't be starved.

966
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,770
We were still young,

967
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,540
so we could spend much time

968
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,280
in pursuing dreams.

969
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Jianjian,

970
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,240
drink some water.

971
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,200
Thanks. Go.

972
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,610
One, two, three.

973
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,320
Yeah.

974
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,520
Look.

975
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,020
It's quite beautiful.

976
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,960
It's really good.

977
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,000
It's quite big.

978
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,680
Yeah.

979
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,280
I'll go for a visit when I have time.

980
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,640
Okay,

981
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,400
but it's a bit far away.

982
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
But it's near the sea,

983
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,520
so the air is pretty good.

984
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,050
It's good to be near the sea.

985
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,020
How time flies.

986
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,460
Jianjian has started her career now.

987
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,520
Well,

988
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,560
as Jianjian graduated,

989
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,960
Ling Xiao should be back.

990
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,560
So good.

991
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,280
I have something

992
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,600
to tell you.

993
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,560
Ling Xiao called me

994
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,520
this morning,

995
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,680
saying that he was hired by the hospital

996
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,600
where he had internship.

997
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,440
He officially

998
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,680
decided to stay.

999
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Doesn't he

1000
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,720
come back?

1001
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,960
Well.

1002
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,600
He always said he'd come back.

1003
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,440
Why did he suddenly decide

1004
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,760
to stay?

1005
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,720
He didn't tell me in details.

1006
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,560
He just said

1007
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,410
his mom can't live without him.

1008
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,840
Isn't a nursemaid hired

1009
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,920
to look after Chen Ting?

1010
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,200
She can go with her

1011
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,360
to the rehabilitation hospital.

1012
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,880
Why can't she live without him?

1013
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,800
It's obvious.

1014
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,610
She doesn't want

1015
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,360
her son to go back.

1016
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,440
I know her well.

1017
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm needed

1018
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,160
by my mom here,

1019
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,560
so I won't go back for two years.

1020
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,400
By then, Chengzi

1021
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,640
will have grown older,

1022
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
and she can look after my mom.

1023
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,040
Oh. Ok

1024
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,530
Li Jianjian?

1025
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,520
Yes?

1026
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,980
I'm still here.

1027
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Turn on the video.

1028
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,850
I want to see you.

1029
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Is it convenient?

1030
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,400
I'm sketching

1031
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,440
with my classmate now.

1032
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,770
It's not so convenient.

1033
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,800
Well, I've got to go.

1034
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,260
I need to continue to draw.

1035
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,320
Keep in touch.

1036
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,170
Bye-bye.

1037
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,200
The dreams we often chase

1038
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,600
are shining

1039
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,040
and distant,

1040
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,000
like stars,

1041
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,320
rainbows,

1042
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,200
and dewdrops rolling on

1043
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,930
the white roses of the morning.

1044
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,540
They're on the opposite side of life.

1045
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,440
On the side of life,

1046
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,160
adults are forced to

1047
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,490
struggle to make living

1048
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,890
without other choices.

1049
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,920
It's food,

1050
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
air

1051
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,850
and the tears that roll down quietly at night.

1052
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,960
Thank you.

1053
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Everyone

1054
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,240
is busy

1055
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,880
in their own life.

1056
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,480
Just like all the relationships,

1057
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
our relationship

1058
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
gradually disappeared

1059
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,960
in the passing time.

1060
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,490
We didn't even miss each other,

1061
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,000
only keeping the beautiful memories

1062
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,080
in childhood

1063
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,680
and the blessings

1064
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,180
that would never be absent in festivals.

1065
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,170
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Wish you health and safety.

1066
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,440
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

1067
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,040
Love you.

1068
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,450
Take the red packet.

1069
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,920
Happy Dragon Boat Festival!

1070
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,960
Wish you health and safety.

1071
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
Remember to have zongzi.

1072
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,400
Happy Chinese Valentine's Day.

1073
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,530
Take the red packet.

1074
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,360
It's the first day of the New Year.

1075
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,480
Wish Li Jianjian

1076
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,640
the best in all things,

1077
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,800
such as health,

1078
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,320
happiness

1079
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,560
and wealth.

1080
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,720
Missing you.

1081
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,600
We were like three little planets,

1082
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,240
which went on sailing

1083
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,280
along their own orbits

1084
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,160
after a short meeting.

1085
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,440
I realized that

1086
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,040
who would come back

1087
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,520
would be back,

1088
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,060
and you didn't need to wait for

1089
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,300
those who wouldn't come back.

1090
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,920
In the summer of 2018,

1091
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,300
Tang Can couldn't move on in Beijing,

1092
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,320
so she came back.

1093
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,200
After getting my parents' permission,

1094
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,280
I rent an apartment

1095
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,440
in a residence community

1096
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,600
near my studio.

1097
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,360
From then on, I lived with

1098
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,640
my two good friends in difficulties who ran away from home.

1099
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,970
We started to live supporting each other.

1100
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
Cheers.

1101
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,680
I looked back

1102
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,400
in the gap of time.

1103
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,200
I had gone pretty far

1104
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,640
on the long road

1105
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,570
which seemed to have no end.

1106
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,520
I was 25.

1107
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,200
I was 25 accomplishing nothing.
