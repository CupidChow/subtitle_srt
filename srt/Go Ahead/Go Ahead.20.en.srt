1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 20

4
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,590
Eat now.

5
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,880
You stayed up late again?

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,740
I was writing a plaint last night.

7
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,750
I'm exhausted.

8
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,720
Then go ahead with it.

9
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,750
I'll go back to my work.

10
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,320
Ziqiu.

11
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,720
Why are you here again?

12
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,690
I'm going to see a friend today.

13
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,770
It's quite empty today.

14
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,920
This is good,

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,490
because it's convenient for me to have a chat.

16
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,720
Hello.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,910
Hello, I would like a cup of American coffee.

18
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,570
Who is that?

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,470
The one that I hate the most.

20
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,650
Li Jianjian's boyfriend?

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,750
He looks not bad.

22
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,360
He doesn't look like a pervert as you said.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,760
You think that's not bad?

24
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,270
Are you blind?

25
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,320
Then what kind

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
of boyfriend do you think

27
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,110
Li Jianjian should have?

28
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,910
She shouldn't have a boyfriend!

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,910
No, I mean

30
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,030
that she's too young

31
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,960
to do that.

32
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,360
She should focus on her career right now.

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,470
Do you mean

34
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,800
that she doesn't need someone to keep her company?

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,750
Well, Ling Xiao and I

36
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,550
can keep her company from now on.

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,120
Why are you staring at me?

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,960
Didn't you have a girlfriend abroad?

39
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,240
Are you kidding me?

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
I didn't have time to have a girlfriend.

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,470
And you didn't fall in love with anyone?

42
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,000
I didn't have time for that.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,630
You just waited to come back to Li Jianjian?

44
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,079
Yes.

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,880
I've solved the case!

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,750
What case? Make it clear with me.

47
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,000
You're in love with Jianjian.

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,440
How could that be?

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,770
Don't deny it right now.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Let me ask you.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,079
Is she always

52
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,440
on your mind?

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,470
Is she the only girl

54
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,240
in your plan

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,190
for future?

56
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,720
And do you want nobody except for her?

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
Come on, that's not the same!

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
Of course it's the same.

59
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,829
I think it's not bad.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,880
If you marry Li Jianjian,

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,190
you two will be

62
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,790
on the same family register.

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
You should think

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
outside the box.

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,390
Think about it from another perspective.

66
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,520
What are the motivations

67
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,010
for all your important decisions?

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,030
What, what motivations

69
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,720
do I have?

70
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,110
I just simply want her to be happy.

71
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,190
So they were not joking

72
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,910
when they called you

73
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,240
a child groom to marry and live with the bride's family

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,630
when you were little.

75
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,160
That's what you really are, bro!

76
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,880
Why are you so wordy?

77
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,960
Just focus on your work!

78
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,950
Focus on your work!

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,050
This is so annoying!

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,640
Ziqiu.

81
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,010
Has Xiao contacted you today?

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
No.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,390
I couldn't get through

84
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,230
and he hasn't replied to my messages on WeChat.

85
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,640
What's going on with him?

86
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,510
I, I don't know.

87
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm going to take a shower.

88
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,070
Is she always

89
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,270
on your mind?

90
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
Is she the only girl

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,110
in your plan

92
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,270
for future?

93
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,790
You're in love with Jianjian.

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Ziqiu, would you like some watermelon?

95
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm going to put my clothes on.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,390
That's not your...

97
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,720
Li Jianjian!

98
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,760
Li Jianjian!

99
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,440
How could you do this?

100
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,440
Ziqiu.

101
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,920
Ziqiu!

102
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,070
You say, has Xiao's phone

103
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,390
been broken?

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,230
I don't think so.

105
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,950
He'll come back

106
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,150
tomorrow afternoon.

107
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,600
He's still on leave.

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,780
Why hasn't he replied my messages on WeChat?

109
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,710
There is always time to reply messages.

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,650
Maybe it's not convenient for him.

111
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,720
Besides, he still has to

112
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,790
persuade his mother

113
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,480
and younger sister, right?

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,670
What if he can't?

115
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,920
Even so,

116
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,830
he will find a way back

117
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,760
even if it means he has to swim back.

118
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,740
Have some watermelon.

119
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,440
That's my spoon.

120
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,040
Take it.

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll get another one.

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,370
Can't you share this spoon with me?

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,050
I don't want to eat your saliva.

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,200
Mom, you haven't eaten anything for a day

125
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,080
and you have a weak stomach.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,340
Do you still care about it?

127
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,320
What should Chengzi do if anything bad happens to you?

128
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,280
That'll be good.

129
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,450
You can take her away with you.

130
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,000
If something bad happens to you,

131
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll go to my grandma.

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,150
I won't go with him.

133
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,680
His father isn't my father!

134
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,760
How could you be so ungrateful?

135
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,080
All these years,

136
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,670
your brother has been taking good care of you.

137
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,130
I didn't ask him to do that.

138
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,210
He did it on his own.

139
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,000
After I leave,

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,080
don't make mom angry like this.

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,550
Be a good girl, OK?

142
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,890
Do you have to go?

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,880
Mom, please give my certificates back.

144
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,340
Are you abandoning us?

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,590
No.

146
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,170
I just want to go back and live over there.

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,280
One, two, three, four, go!

148
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,080
The world is fickle

149
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
When you are with me

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll have enough time

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,840
to prove eternity

152
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,520
The blank in my life

153
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,910
is now filled with those wishes for you

154
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,520
My heart will beat only for you

155
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,520
My baby, baby

156
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,950
What are you laughing at?

157
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,760
Jianjian,

158
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,670
let's go singing after work.

159
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah! Yeah!

160
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,770
Jianjian, Jianjian, come with us!

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
No, thank you.

162
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,640
You two just go ahead

163
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
and I don't want to be a third wheel.

164
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,790
You can bring your boyfriend.

165
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,640
No.

166
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,010
I have to go back and wait for Xiao.

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,030
You're really childhood sweethearts.

168
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,840
It hasn't been long since your brothers came back

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,400
and now you just keep

170
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,150
talking about them.

171
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,110
What a slap in the face!

172
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,760
They're not your real brothers.

173
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,320
You're having an ambiguous relationship.

174
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,110
Miss Li,

175
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,150
doesn't your boyfriend care about it?

176
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,320
What are you talking about?

177
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,910
They grew up together,

178
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,230
so they're very close to each other.

179
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,110
Come on!

180
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,520
Young men and women

181
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,550
who're not blood-related

182
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,750
can't have pure family love among them.

183
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,670
Just go and make me

184
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,640
a cup of coffee.

185
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Just go.

186
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,710
Can't you just shut up?

187
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,230
Please don't take it to heart.

188
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,280
He's too mean.

189
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,590
His singing was so bad

190
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,190
that it was going out of tune.

191
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,790
I'm back.

192
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,230
It's so early!

193
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,440
It has just passed four o'clock and you've started cooking yet?

194
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
It's been a long time

195
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
since we had dumplings the last time,

196
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,020
so I'm making dumplings for tonight.

197
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,350
You're really like a mom.

198
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,490
Has Ling Xiao got off the plane?

199
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,710
I don't know.

200
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,470
Call him!

201
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,150
I can't get in touch with him.

202
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,200
Maybe his phone is broken.

203
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,350
Don't be angry.

204
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,150
Give him a hard time when he comes back.

205
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,840
I'll leave it to you.

206
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,110
Sorry,

207
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,280
the subscriber you dialed

208
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,710
cannot be connected，

209
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,910
please redial later.

210
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,880
Sorry,

211
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,030
the subscriber you dialed

212
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,470
cannot be connected，

213
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,080
please redial later.

214
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,790
The plane might be late.

215
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,760
Should we eat first?

216
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,400
It's not late. I've checked it.

217
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,150
Maybe he missed the plane?

218
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,880
Jianjian...

219
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
Ling Xiao's back!

220
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,350
Ling Xiao! Ling Xiao! Ling Xiao!

221
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,950
Ling Xiao!

222
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,910
Is he back?

223
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,400
Don't you know the password?

224
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,030
Why didn't you just get in?

225
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,150
Didn't you ask me

226
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,550
to ring the doorbell and knock at the door

227
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,550
before coming in like Ling Xiao did?

228
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,470
Where's Ling Xiao?

229
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,600
He hasn't come back.

230
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,790
Not yet?

231
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,760
What's going on with him?

232
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,420
We can't get in touch with him.

233
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,550
Ziqiu,

234
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,230
do you have his phone number

235
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,590
in Singapore?

236
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,640
No.

237
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,670
Alright. Go and see Li Jianjian.

238
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,930
She has been waiting since five o'clock.

239
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,520
He shouldn't have come back at all! What a troublemaker!

240
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,470
How could you say that?

241
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,840
How could you call him a troublemaker?

242
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,790
So your Zhuang Bei is the best?

243
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,910
But his mother won all your money

244
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,640
when playing mahjong with you.

245
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,640
You're not his girlfriend yet,

246
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,840
but you've already began to defend him!

247
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,000
I was just saying.

248
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,760
I think Ling Xiao must have

249
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
missed the plane.

250
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,670
It happens.

251
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,350
Maybe it was because of the weather,

252
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,230
or he lost something.

253
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,210
There're a lot of possibilities.

254
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,710
It's not the end of world

255
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,510
and there's not only one flight.

256
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,590
Yes.

257
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
There will be one tomorrow morning.

258
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,030
Go to bed early today.

259
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,320
We have to go home early tomorrow

260
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,470
to offer incense at eight o'clock.

261
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,270
Don't you want to eat something?

262
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,170
I don't want to eat.

263
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,970
I just want to have some pineapple tarts.

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,730
I'll go and buy some for you.

265
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,440
No need!

266
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,200
Xiao said

267
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,960
that there were

268
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,150
some great pineapple tarts near his college,

269
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,680
and he would buy some for me.

270
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,520
I just want to have those right now.

271
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,150
Jianjian, come.

272
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,350
Mom, Happy New Year!

273
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,470
No, it's not happy new year.

274
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, as you see,

275
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,670
dad and I are fine.

276
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm not rich yet,

277
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,200
but soon I might be.

278
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,750
I will keep working hard.

279
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,840
By the way, dad is still single now.

280
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,350
I asked him to get married again,

281
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,590
but if you don't agree,

282
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,960
please come and tell me in my dream.

283
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
Don't talk nonsense.

284
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,200
Anyway, we are all fine.

285
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,520
Don't worry about us.

286
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,910
OK.

287
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,470
Aunt, this is Ziqiu.

288
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm back from UK.

289
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,280
I majored in desserts abroad

290
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,910
and I've came back to open a coffee shop.

291
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,230
The business is fine.

292
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,230
I hope you'll bless my business.

293
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,880
Please rest assured

294
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,230
and I will take good care

295
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,630
of dad and Jianjian here.

296
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,560
Good. Good.

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,110
When Ling Xiao is back,

298
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,400
I'll ask him to do it.

299
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,680
Dad, will every relative be here today?

300
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,830
Yes, of course.

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,060
I've even invited our old neighbors.

302
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,070
We'll go to our noodle restaurant first.

303
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,590
And I've booked eight tables

304
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,560
in Baixiangju.

305
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,680
So you mean

306
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
both of the second aunt in my mother's family and the second aunt in your family

307
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,470
will come?

308
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,830
Well,

309
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,110
as long as there is a chance to join in the fun,

310
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,520
they'll definitely come.

311
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,110
Don't talk about them like that.

312
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,430
They're just supposed to come.

313
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,920
Why should the second aunt in your father's family come too?

314
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Annoying, right?

315
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,630
How annoying!

316
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,310
Make yourselves at home!

317
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,920
Please have some more sunflower seeds.

318
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,710
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

319
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,040
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

320
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,040
Your mother was so pretty,

321
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,280
and we had never seen

322
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,950
such a pretty woman

323
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,680
in our little fishing village.

324
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,160
She was like a fairy

325
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,160
and I was wondering

326
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,950
why she took a fancy to your dad.

327
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,710
But then

328
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,110
she just took your father's money and left!

329
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,120
Have you found your mother?

330
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,590
No.

331
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Yeah.

332
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,830
There's no need to get her back.

333
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,110
She abandoned you when you were little

334
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,430
and when she's old, she will ask you to take care of her.

335
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,880
In her dreams!

336
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,800
Ziqiu, you can't be ungrateful!

337
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:45,830
You have to pay your dad back.

338
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,070
You have to pay your dad back.

339
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,430
OK, I got it, Aunt.

340
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,400
Don't worry.

341
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,980
Have you got a girlfriend?

342
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,310
Not yet.

343
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,900
What do you think about Jianjian?

344
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,760
It'll be great if you marry her!

345
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,310
You know each other so well.

346
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,230
She was ugly

347
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,830
when she was little,

348
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,520
but now she's much prettier.

349
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,640
Aunt, I've never been ugly.

350
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,350
Yes, you were not ugly. You were just dark-skinned.

351
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,520
When you were born,

352
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
you were so dark-skinned like a piece of charcoal.

353
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,230
She doesn't look dark in the picture.

354
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,040
It doesn't show in the picture.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Jianjian, come over here!

356
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,470
Grandma!

357
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,430
Jianjian.

358
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,400
Aunt, Uncle.

359
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,280
Let me have a look at you.

360
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,710
Look at you!

361
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,560
You've become a young woman.

362
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,280
Look at her.

363
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,040
Jianjian,

364
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,710
what's his name?

365
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,710
He's He Ziqiu.

366
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,070
Didn't he leave

367
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,350
with his real dad?

368
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,880
I heard that his real dad was really rich.

369
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,040
You even went to court for his custody.

370
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,240
So why did his real dad let him come back?

371
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,060
He's not close to them.

372
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,230
He did the right thing.

373
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,800
And he's really grateful.

374
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,350
Yes.

375
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,210
He's grateful.

376
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,710
Where is your big brother?

377
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,830
What big brother?

378
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,880
The son of their neighbor upstairs.

379
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,040
He grew up at Haichao's.

380
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,110
He even took care of his neighbor's son?

381
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,190
Yes, he's a really good man.

382
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,800
Jianjian,

383
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,760
your dad is really a good man.

384
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,470
See? For you,

385
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,400
your dad hasn't got married again.

386
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,310
So you

387
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,520
should take good care of your dad in the future.

388
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,470
Get married and have a baby soon

389
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,040
to make your dad happy.

390
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,230
It's not up to me.

391
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,290
I'll just let nature take its course.

392
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,640
My grandma is here. I'll leave you to it.

393
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,110
OK. OK.

394
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,400
Grandma!

395
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,310
-I miss you so much!
-Jianjian!

396
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,830
It's been two months since you came to see me the last time!

397
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,830
Sit down, please.

398
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,560
Aunt!

399
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,830
Where's Jiaojiao? Why didn't Jiaojiao come?

400
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,430
There's no need for her to come. She'll only make trouble here.

401
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,110
She won't make trouble here. She'll only make it livelier.

402
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,880
Time flies so fast!

403
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,230
Now,

404
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,800
your mother has passed away

405
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
for 21 years.

406
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,230
Your mother used to be

407
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,680
such a great woman.

408
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,230
A lot of men took a fancy to her,

409
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,760
but she just fell for your father,

410
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,190
because she thought your father was a good man.

411
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,880
But your grandpa didn't agree,

412
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
saying that it was no use being a good man

413
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,800
and the owner of a small noodle restaurant

414
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,280
just made some hard money by working from dawn to dusk.

415
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,160
And then it was your grandma who agreed to it,

416
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,690
saying that a good man would be a good husband.

417
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,470
Your mother was right about your father.

418
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,760
Yes, she was.

419
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,760
There's very few people

420
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,040
like him these days.

421
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,070
He's good to everyone

422
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,470
except himself.

423
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,760
Jianjian, listen to me.

424
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,710
You should ask your dad

425
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,760
to get married again.

426
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,470
Otherwise,

427
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,880
when you get married,

428
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,590
your dad will be all alone at home.

429
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,950
That's too pathetic.

430
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,190
Yeah.

431
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,590
Grandma, Aunt.

432
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,560
Here's your tea.

433
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,830
Ziqiu, sit down.

434
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,430
OK.

435
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,430
Ziqiu,

436
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,110
I want to discuss something with you.

437
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,800
OK.

438
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,920
Do you remember Jiaojiao?

439
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,950
Yes, I do.

440
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,710
Jiaojiao is....

441
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,520
Aunt!

442
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,830
Does Jiaojiao have a boyfriend right now?

443
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,360
I don't like her boyfriend.

444
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,470
Grandma, you have a good taste

445
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,830
and you've seen Jiaojiao's boyfriend,

446
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,000
so what do you think about him?

447
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,760
He's not bad.

448
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,680
Ziqiu is not bad,

449
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,830
and so is that young man.

450
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,280
I don't think so.

451
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,560
His family is so poor

452
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,690
that they have nothing but the bare walls in their house.

453
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,830
Grandma,

454
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,110
would you like me to get you something to eat?

455
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,590
I'm going to help my dad.

456
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,800
Aunt, I'll leave you to it.

457
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,860
Be seated, please.

458
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,230
Watch your mouth.

459
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,090
Dad is looking for you.

460
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,760
We're going to

461
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
Baixiangju in a while.

462
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,210
Why are you hiding here?

463
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,310
My face has got tense from smiling all the time.

464
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,910
I came out for some fresh air.

465
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,950
Just bear it for one day.

466
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,680
I'm fine, but you should be careful.

467
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,680
It's your mother's

468
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,810
death anniversary,

469
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,430
but those relatives

470
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,070
from your hometown

471
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,830
want to arrange blind dates for me.

472
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,710
Unbelievable!

473
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,520
Back then they hated me

474
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,310
for being a freeloader here.

475
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,560
Now in their eyes,

476
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,760
you're a goose that can lay golden eggs.

477
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,350
They disliked you back then,

478
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,810
but now they want you to be their son-in-law.

479
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,460
I should be a male goose even if I were a goose.

480
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,350
Want it?

481
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,880
No.

482
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,190
I licked it.

483
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,790
It has my saliva on it and it's a bit disgusting.

484
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,920
It's fine. I don't mind it.

485
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,040
Thank you.

486
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,690
I wonder if Ling Xiao

487
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,360
will come back today.

488
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,450
The car is here.

489
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,470
Uncle, please drive slowly.

490
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,110
OK. OK.

491
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,970
Watch your head.

492
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,830
Slowly.

493
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,430
Jianjian,

494
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,430
come and visit us with your brothers when you have time.

495
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,880
-OK.
-OK, Aunt.

496
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,470
Bye, Aunt.

497
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,880
Bye. Bye.

498
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,350
Bye.

499
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,880
Slowly.

500
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,940
Goodbye, Haichao.

501
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,560
The seat belt.

502
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,190
Yes, fasten it.

503
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,990
OK. Thank you.

504
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Have they all left?

505
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,390
Your biggest uncle hasn't left.

506
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,640
He said that it was not easy for the children to come here,

507
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,900
and they want to go to the amusement park.

508
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,950
Are they going to stay in my bedroom?

509
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,950
Of course not.

510
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,760
I've booked a room for them in the hotel.

511
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,000
But you have to take them

512
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,310
to the amusement park.

513
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,810
That's settled.

514
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,400
Qiqi, Pengpeng, come here.

515
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,520
It's not settled. It's not...

516
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,830
Your aunt has agreed.

517
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,470
Aunt! Aunt!

518
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,600
She is really happy.

519
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,760
See? See?

520
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,350
They're having a good time now.

521
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,880
Come and get me.

522
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,520
I'll take you to play if you can catch me.

523
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,350
Go and catch her!

524
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,160
Ziqiu!

525
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,480
Ask her to buy you something delicious.

526
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,070
By the way,

527
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,590
we still

528
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,190
have to

529
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,070
do business tomorrow.

530
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,830
Dad and I

531
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,560
are going back to do the cleaning.

532
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,470
Yes.

533
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,070
Let's go now. Let's go.

534
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,280
I'll leave you to it.

535
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,740
Take good care of the kids.

536
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,640
You...

537
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,190
Where should we go?

538
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,230
The amusement park. Let's go!

539
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,950
Let's go.

540
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,000
Is your mother's ashes

541
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,330
sprinkled into the sea?

542
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,470
Can she receive it

543
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,230
if we burn the paper money here?

544
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,880
Yes!

545
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,880
My dad said

546
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,680
that they were all linked together.

547
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,760
The rivers and the seas are the same.

548
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,250
Why are you drinking it?

549
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,520
Didn't dad ask us

550
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,780
to sprinkle three cups of it afterwards?

551
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,830
I know.

552
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,000
I just want to have a taste of it for my mom.

553
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
I'll share it with her in a while.

554
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,590
Come. Let me have a taste.

555
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
I've never drank white wine before.

556
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
What do you think?

557
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,760
It tastes bad.

558
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,830
That's the taste of life.

559
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,230
Don't pretend to be sophisticated.

560
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,800
I mean it.

561
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,190
Mr. Ling said

562
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,280
that life was made

563
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,400
of the sweets and bitters,

564
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,470
which means

565
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,920
in our lives,

566
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,590
it was mostly sweet and sour at the beginning,

567
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,590
and then it was

568
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,990
mostly bitter and spicy.

569
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,050
The wine tastes bitter and spicy,

570
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,590
and only adults can have

571
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,040
and appreciate it.

572
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,490
But this bitter and spicy wine

573
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,830
looks just like water.

574
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,800
So it's confusing.

575
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,160
It's transparent

576
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,520
and it looks common

577
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,920
just like water,

578
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,110
but after you take a sip,

579
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,840
it can make your tears come out.

580
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,660
Don't throw up!

581
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,840
Li Jianjian,

582
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,130
tell me if you want to throw up.

583
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Let go. Let go.

584
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,130
You're holding me too tightly.

585
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Ziqiu!

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,880
Don't go!

587
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,040
What?

588
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,040
I said don't go!

589
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,710
I won't go.

590
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,800
I won't leave you again.

591
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,190
If Ling Xiao can't come back,

592
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,490
you'll always have me.

593
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,590
What a strong smell of alcohol!

594
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,680
How could you let her drink so much wine?

595
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,230
She didn't drink too much.

596
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,470
Besides,

597
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,440
we didn't know it was so strong.

598
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
She dares to drink anything.

599
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Even if you give her some rat poison,

600
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,960
she dares to drink it too.

601
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,260
What are you doing now?

602
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,950
OK. Just go home.

603
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,410
I can take care of her here.

604
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,590
I'll get her a towel

605
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,990
to wipe her face and feet.

606
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,160
You've grown up.

607
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,560
It's not like when you were kids.

608
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,090
Please keep your distance.

609
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,670
Then I'm leaving now.

610
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,770
Just go home.

611
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,160
Have you got in touch with Ling Xiao?

612
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,710
No.

613
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,350
This is weird. Why hasn't he called me yet?

614
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,760
He hasn't even called me,

615
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,090
so how would he call you?

616
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,800
Are we the same?

617
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,360
What do you mean?

618
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,640
Now go home and sleep.

619
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,190
Just go to bed.

620
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,800
I think there's something you didn't tell me!

621
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,590
What did you mean?

622
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,470
Just go to bed.

623
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,090
Li Jianjian, lie on your back.

624
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,280
Li Jianjian,

625
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,140
don't sleep until I change your clothes.

626
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,430
Have they all left?

627
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,060
Most of them have left,

628
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,690
and I sent the rest of them to the hotel.

629
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,760
I'm so impressed by you.

630
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,950
You took care

631
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,610
of such a big event all by yourself.

632
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,110
It's their customs

633
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,560
to prepare a feast

634
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,650
on the 21st death anniversary.

635
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,000
So I had to do it.

636
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,000
Let me drink with you.

637
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,730
How can you drink today?

638
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,310
I've asked for a leave.

639
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,110
Come!

640
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,400
You say,

641
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,560
how time

642
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
flies!

643
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,290
It's been 21 years since Huiying passed away.

644
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,190
These years,

645
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,590
I didn't feel

646
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,230
time flying by.

647
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,070
But after everyone came

648
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,470
and then left suddenly,

649
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,800
I feel so empty.

650
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,560
It's been about 20 years since we first met each other.

651
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,160
They were this little back then,

652
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,880
and now they're grown-ups.

653
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,190
We've got old.

654
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,430
Back then,

655
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,350
when we stayed up all night,

656
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,040
we didn't feel anything

657
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,400
after taking a good nap.

658
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,520
But now it's different.

659
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,190
Yeah!

660
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,520
You've got old,

661
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,180
so take good care of yourself.

662
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,680
If you fall sick,

663
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,610
it might be a trouble for Ling Xiao.

664
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,210
It has been hard enough

665
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,040
for him these years.

666
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,430
You know what,

667
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,710
I shouldn't have let him go

668
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,680
to Singapore!

669
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,600
It's no use talking about it right now.

670
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
It's all over now.

671
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
What did Ling Xiao

672
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,350
say to you over the phone

673
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,470
this afternoon?

674
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,680
He said

675
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,610
that he missed the plane the previous day

676
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,070
and it took him one more day to transfer flight,

677
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,830
and his phone was broken,

678
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,000
so he borrowed someone else's phone at the airport

679
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to call me.

680
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,000
I knew he was lying instantly.

681
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,000
Chen Ting must have made it hard for Ling Xiao.

682
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,470
And probably his phone

683
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,470
was broken by her.

684
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,160
You know what,

685
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,190
I really want to call Chen Ting

686
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,070
and ask her

687
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,950
how she could keep

688
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,310
pestering Xiao

689
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,160
after abandoning him at the beginning!

690
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,960
How could she?

691
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,400
It must be Ling Xiao.

692
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,230
He's back.

693
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,560
Dad.

694
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,800
You're back.

695
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,920
Come in.

696
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,950
Mr. Li.

697
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,590
Have you come to an agreement with your mother?

698
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,430
Yes.

699
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,370
Sit down. I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

700
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
No need.

701
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,680
I've had something on the plane.

702
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,710
Is it too late

703
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,830
to offer incense right now?

704
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,680
No, it's not.

705
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,350
It's not too late before 12 o'clock.

706
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,880
Go.

707
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
Huiying,

708
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,520
all the three kids

709
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,280
are here now.

710
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,630
Please bless them

711
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,520
in the heaven.

712
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,360
Well, Mr. Li,

713
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,320
when did Jianjian

714
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,250
and Ziqiu leave?

715
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,150
Jianjian has been

716
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,870
waiting for you all day

717
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,080
at the gate

718
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,190
of the residential quarter

719
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,909
and they went to burn the paper money after dark.

720
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,600
I think they must have

721
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,130
gone back home afterwards.

722
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,670
You asked me to tell Jianjian

723
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,230
that you would come back tonight,

724
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,030
but I got too busy and I forgot it.

725
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,390
So Jianjian didn't know

726
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,320
that Ling Xiao would come back tonight?

727
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,520
I didn't tell her.

728
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,630
I forgot it.

729
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,230
Well, Mr. Li,

730
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,230
Dad, I'm going back now.

731
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,630
I have to go to work tomorrow.

732
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,870
Take care!

733
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:09,840
OK.

734
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,000
Wait, there's no rush.

735
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,430
OK.

736
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,710
Slowly.

737
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,870
What a bad memory I have!

738
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,040
Just leave.

739
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,520
What can you remember?

740
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,190
I've finally took a leave.

741
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,080
Let's have a drink.

742
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,000
What do you want to drink?

743
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,060
Aren't you too embarrassed to drink?

744
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,630
How could you have forgotten it?

745
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,040
Jianjian has been waiting

746
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,630
for a few days.

747
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,440

779
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,960
Morning.

780
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,840
It must be a dream.

781
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,360
He didn't mean that.

782
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,320
Li Jianjian, come out to eat.

783
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,600
Hurry up.

784
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,230
Ling Xiao,

785
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,360
even if there was no direct flight ticket

786
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,760
and it took you one day to transfer flight,

787
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,390
you should have called!

788
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,630
I called

789
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,150
Jianjian and Ziqiu at the airport

790
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,390
with someone else's phone,

791
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,520
but no one answered.

792
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,000
I saw a phone call

793
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
from the special administrative region

794
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,520
and I thought it was a fraud call,

795
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,600
so I didn't answer it.

796
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,360
You're unbelievable!

797
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,600
Mingyue said

798
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,360
that her mother asked her to live at home for a few days.

799
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,870
Really?

800
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,000
I saw her with a long face

801
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,150
in the early morning.

802
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,150
That explains it.

803
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,630
She moved out because she didn't want

804
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,190
to take a hit from her mother every day.

805
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,990
She trembles when she gets home.

806
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,010
Ling Xiao came back so late yesterday

807
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,430
and she left so early this morning,

808
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,560
so does she know that Ling Xiao is back?

809
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,490
I don't think she does.

810
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,870
Since Mingyue is not here,

811
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,400
let's interview Ling Xiao.

812
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,760
When did you start

813
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,230
coveting our beautiful

814
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,930
and considerate Mingyue?

815
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,080
Coveting?

816
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,390
Having a secret love is exciting,

817
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,190
but it's more awesome

818
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,590
to make your love public.

819
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,080
Mingyue has confessed her love to you,

820
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
and you should just take the chance.

821
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,140
My secret love?

822
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,870
Wait! She has already confessed her love?

823
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,120
But she told me

824
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,870
that she would wait a little longer.

825
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,360
You knew

826
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,670
that Mingyue was in love with Ling Xiao too?

827
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,000
I knew it a long time ago.

828
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,080
I want to tell her

829
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,390
that I'm in love with someone.

830
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,120
Isn't that someone

831
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Mingyue?

832
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,800
It's not?

833
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,840
But you said that you were in love

834
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,370
with a junior schoolmate in your high school.

835
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,710
Oh, my!
