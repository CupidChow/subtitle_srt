I've told you I'm fine.

19

Why did you still come over?

20
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,520
We were afraid that you might jump into the sea.

I was startled.

24
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,200
Ms. He Mei is really,

25
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,680
really

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,560

about something like that?

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,400
♫Right now♫

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,079
Does she even know how to tell the truth?

32
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,120
News travels fast with dad.

33

♫Let’s go together♫

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,480
It's no big deal

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,000
and there's no need to be startled.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,460
You think it's no big deal?

37
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,170
She's not remarried

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,570
and she went to jail.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Ziqiu, you do

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,320
take after Ms. He Mei.

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,900
Both of you do big deals

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,520
without telling anyone.

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,200
It's not doing big deals.

44
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,280
It's making big troubles!

45
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,800
I can't believe

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
there're two of you in this world

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
who's so irritating.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
Oh, so now you know?

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,320
Now you know

51
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,920
how bad a lie could have made it.

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,400
Li Jianjian,

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,660
could you just shut up?

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,680
If you can't,

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,360
go and swim in the sea

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,620
to calm yourself down.

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,180
What do you think about it?

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Can you understand Ms. He Mei?

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,640
I think I can

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,500
understand her

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
just a little bit.

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,280
I understand why

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,340
that she wanted Ziqiu to live with us,

64
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,440
but I don't understand

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,600
the rest of it.

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
Everyone is

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
different.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,280
Some people

69
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,600
like to put hope

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,659
on their children,

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
while some others

72
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
like to protect their children

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
by keeping distance.

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,560
After hearing what you said,

75
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,600
I think

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,800
the second is better.

77
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,080
But it's only

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
a little bit better.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
Ziqiu, what do you think?

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't know.

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,100
I wasn't abandoned

82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
because I was a burden to her.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
When I learnt that,

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,360
I felt a little bit relieved.

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,490
She didn't marry again or have another child,

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,490
which makes me a little bit more relieved.

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,140
But she has had a hard time all these years

88
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,020
and I feel bad about it.

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,960
I don't think

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
it's about forgiveness,

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,860
because I’ve never hated her.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,050
I really don't know.

93
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,770
So Xiao said you two were alike.

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,159
You two think

95
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,490
in exactly the same way.

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
You went abroad

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,720
to save money for our family

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
and to protect me from Zhao Huaguang.

99
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,800
But that was only

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
your assumption.

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,140
Can you stop talking about it?

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,120
I was wrong, OK?

103
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,220
I was really wrong.

104
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,159
Li Jianjian,

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,930
give him a break.

106
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
OK, I'll listen to you.

107
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Did you fall in love with Ling Xiao

108
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
when you were little?

109
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
What?

110
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
Since I first

111
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,400
met you,

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,240
you've been running

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
after Ling Xiao the whole time.

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
And when you wanted to do something bad,

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,280
you would ask me to help you,

116
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,880
so Xiao wouldn't know about it.

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
You never beat him or tell him off,

118
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,210
but you beat me and tell me off all the time.

119
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,880
Really?

120
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Do I? I don't think so.

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,880
Yes, you did.

122
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
When you see Ling Xiao,

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,760
your eyes sparkle

124
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,320
like a bulb

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,650
that has been turned on.

126
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
You always talk about Ling Xiao,

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
like he's the best in this world.

128
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
Xiao is the best.

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,840
You're the best too.

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,600
Well,

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
back then,

132
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,159
I was not in love with him.

133
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,200
I just liked being with him.

134
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,240
You liked being with him,

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,570
so isn't it the same?

136
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,130
Of course it's not the same.

137
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
Right?

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
It's gross.

139
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,280
Let me show you something grosser.

140
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Li Jianjian, how could you do that?

141
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't you know your feet stink?

142
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,720
Don't run after me!

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,320

in this world.

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Thank you.

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,040
No need to thank me.

178
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,530
But please take good care of yourself.

179
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,800
Chrysanthemum flower,

180
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,660
a walking chrysanthemum flower.

181
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,440
Would you send me

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,280
to Syrian?

183
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,840
Anyone home?

184
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,660
Mr. Ling, you're back.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Dad.

186
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,080
Well, I passed by the noodle restaurant just now

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,800
and I saw that your dad and Ziqiu

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,560
were talking,

189
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
so I didn't get in.

190
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
Is Ziqiu alright?

191
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,040
He's fine.

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,560
Are you having

193
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
your Chinese herbal medicine?

194
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,800
Yes, I am.

195
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,810
Does it work?

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,560
Yes.

197
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,600
Don't forget

198
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,920
to take your medicine

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,400
and don't eat

200
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
stimulating food

201
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,720
like seafood

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,800
and things

203
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,480
like radish.

204
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,010
Jianjian, watch him for me.

205
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,040
After you finish the medicine,

206
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,100
I'll take you to see the doctor again.

207
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,680
By the way,

208
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,800
did your mother tell you

209
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,880
when she would leave?

210
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,800
I've booked flight tickets for Sunday for them.

211
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,480
It's enough to be here for a couple of days.

212
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,520
She should take good care of her body.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,280
If she goes around

214
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,080
in her wheelchair

215
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
every day,

216
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
it'll be a trouble for you.

217
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Mr. Ling,

218
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,020
you're even more wordy than my dad is!

219
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,640
No, I'm not.

220
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,040
Your dad is so awesome

221
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,040
that he can even crack cases like the police.

222
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,800
Well,

223
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,120
are you staying at home tonight?

224
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,480
Yes, we are.

225
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
OK, I'll leave you to it.

226
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
I'll go upstairs and take a shower.

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,580
It's been a long day today.

228
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,480
Your dad is getting old.

229
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
He has started to worry about stuff.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,080
Let's get married.

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,420
Let's get married.

232
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,780
Look at you.

233
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,340
I'll make money and buy a house first.

234
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't want your house.

235
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
I want some fruits.

236
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,440
Mingyue, I've arrived in your residential quarter

237
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
to get the family register.

238
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,840
Are you coming back soon?

239
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,700
Mom, I'm on the night shift today.

240
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,160
Then I'll go and get it myself.

241
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,020
Is anyone home?

242
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,440
No.

243
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,600
Then send me the password.

244
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,320
Mom, please go home.

245
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,250
I'll bring it to you some other day.

246
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,640
Mrs. Qi?

247
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,960
Tang Can?

248
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,900
Why did you come back so early?

249
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,680
I've got off work.

250
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,840
Great.

251
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,240
I was asking Mingyue the password,

252
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
because I need to get something in her bedroom.

253
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,520
Let's go.

254
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,120
OK.

255
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,960
I've got to go. Tang Can is back.

256
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,520
Is it in the bedside table?

257
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,520
No.

258
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,640
I'll look for it.

259
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,920
The door is open.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,640
Mom!

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
Mrs. Qi.

262
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
OK, thank you, Tang Can.

263
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,680
I'll leave

264
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,480
after getting something

265
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
and cleaning her bedroom.

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
I can handle it myself.

267
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,080
OK. OK.

268
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
Hello, Mingyue,

269
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,410
your mother is in your bedroom.

270
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Didn't you put

271
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,920
your family register in your office?

272
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,450
So she won't find it anyway.

273
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,080
Look,

274
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
this notebook is full of notes.

275
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
Qi Mingyue,

276
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,850
come back right now!

277
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Li Jianjian,

278
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Mrs. Qi is furious

279
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,940
and Mingyue will be back soon.

280
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
When will you come back?

281
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
I'll be back soon.

282
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
I need to get changed

283
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
to go to a movie with Xiao.

284
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,640
Then wait for Mingyue

285
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,440
and come back together with her.

286
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,760
It's terrible right here.

287
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,300
Mrs. Qi, have some water, please.

288
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,300
Mom, what's wrong?

289
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,100
I left the family register in the office.

290
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Explain this!

291
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,600
Have you read it?

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
Answer me!

293
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,280
I don't want to take the civil service exam.

294
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,200
I don't want to be

295
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,130
a civil servant.

296
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,800
Mrs. Qi!

297
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Calm down! Calm down!

298
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Tell them.

299
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,720
Have I ever

300
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
beaten you before

301
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,520
since you were born?

302
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,840
This is my precious daughter.

303
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,850
How dare you lie to me

304
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
about this?

305
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,680
I didn't plan to lie to you

306
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,940
and I don't want to.

307
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,960
But I really don't want

308
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,040
to be a civil servant.

309
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,520
I want to be a journalist

310
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
and I just need to go to work in Beijing for two years.

311
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,250
You still want to go to Beijing?

312
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,200
Mom, when I was in high school,

313
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,800
you told me

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
that you wanted me to go to Beijing,

315
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
because there were a lot of opportunities in Beijing.

316
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,160
Those opportunities are

317
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,620
for someone outstanding.

318
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,680
What are you good at?

319
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,400
If you accomplish nothing after two years,

320
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
what can you get?

321
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,200
They'll give you such a good opportunity?

322
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
Why don't you use your head

323
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,560
to think about it?

324
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,040
Beijing is filled with talents,

325
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,200
so what makes you better than others?

326
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,480
I'm not better than others,

327
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
but I'm not worse than others, either.

328
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,880
When I was in school,

329
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,080
I was always one of the top five in my class.

330
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,040
I gained scholarship three years in a row in college.

331
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,080
I've done pretty good at work

332
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
and I've got excellent internal comments.

333
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
What makes me worse than others, Mom?

334
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Your mental quality is poor.

335
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
You do well at normal times,

336
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
but you always fail at critical points.

337
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,800
Didn't you fail

338
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,400
your college entrance exam?

339
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,829
You got 50 to 60 less points

340
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,290
than you did in mock exams.

341
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,310
You even planned to

342
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,560
apply for China University of Political Science and Law.

343
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,920
It was you who wanted me to apply for China University of Political Science and Law!

344
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,349
I've never wanted to apply for

345
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,000
China University of Political Science and Law.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,109
You wanted me to be a lawyer

347
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,640
or a prosecutor.

348
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
That was what you wanted!

349
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,520
I've never wanted it!

350
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,090
What's the difference?

351
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,690
Don't you know how much points you got?

352
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,760
I'll tell you what the difference is.

353
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
The difference is

354
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,160
that if I had wanted it,

355
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,690
I would have been admitted.

356
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,440
Do you really think

357
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
you could have been admitted

358
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,680
with your result?

359
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,480
Mom, can you please

360
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
stop disapproving me?

361
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,240
You've always

362
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,800
been disapproving me

363
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
since my childhood,

364
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,960
unless I was the first in my class.

365
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,560
You disapprove the dishes I order.

366
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,800
You disapprove the clothes I choose.

367
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
You always

368
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
disapprove everything I do

369
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,960
in my life!

370
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,120
Everything!

371
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,640
You think I'm disapproving you?

372
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm showing you my concern!

373
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,880
I don't need it!

374
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I don’t want

375
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
your concern like that.

376
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,200
Qi Mingyue,

377
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,460
how could you be so heartless?

378
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
I've worked

379
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
so hard

380
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
to provide for you.

381
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,800
I gave you

382
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
a good learning environment,

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,880
but now you tell me

384
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,410
that it's not what you want?

385
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,400
Why didn't you tell me

386
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,280
if you didn't want it

387
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,410
when I gave it to you?

388
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,160
Have you asked about my opinion?

389
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,360
Have you ever listened to my opinion?

390
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,560
You say we're equal,

391
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,880
but we're not equal at all!

392
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,760
I shouldn't have let you move out

393
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,220
to live with your friends.

394
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
Look at

395
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
what you've learnt

396
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,210
from your best friends.

397
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Telling lies,

398
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,120
talking big,

399
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,090
talking back to your mother

400
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,320
and drinking wine!

401
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,240
It has nothing to do with them!

402
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Why did you get them involved?

403
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,720
Why can't I get them involved?

404
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Did I say anything wrong?

405
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,380
Were you like this before?

406
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,240
You move back home

407
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,120
tomorrow!

408
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,840
And prepare for

409
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,170
the civil service exam!

410
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,080
Mrs. Qi, don't be angry.

411
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,240
Don’t take the things

412
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
that she says in anger seriously.

413
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Calm down. Calm down.

414
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Please calm down.

415
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,570
Mom, you don't know me well.

416
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,000
I've always been

417
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,720
like this.

418
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm good at telling lies

419
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,490
since my childhood.

420
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,360
You always want a good daughter,

421
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,600
but I've done all the things

422
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,560
that you don't want me to do

423
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,840
behind your back.

424
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,800
Do you know

425
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,960
why I got 50 to 60 points less

426
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,640
than I did in the mock exams?

427
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,640
Because I had an answer sheet

428
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
unfilled on purpose.

429
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,000
You're lying.

430
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
I had no other choice.

431
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
Because I know

432
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,320
if I had got enough points,

433
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,920
you would have forced me to apply for China University of Political Science and Law,

434
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,800
so I chose

435
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,000
the stupidest way.

436
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,500
I will be a journalist!

437
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,570
I will go to Beijing!

438
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,640
I will go outside

439
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,680
to see this world!

440
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,560
I will fail

441
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,040
and I will suffer!

442
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to see

443
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,880
what I can achieve in the end!

444
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,780
I won't listen to you anymore!

445
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,760
Good.

446
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,280
Good for you!

447
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,820
Don't worry. I'll see her off.

448
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,800
Mrs. Qi!

449
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,080
Mrs. Qi!

450
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,440
Mrs. Qi!

451
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,970
Don't be angry, please.

452
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,040
Mingyue,

453
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,080
Mingyue didn't mean it.

454
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,440
Is it true that she deliberately

455
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,160
had the answer sheet unfilled?

456
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,620
I've never heard about it.

457
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,200
Did you know it long ago?

458
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,080
Are you lying too?

459
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,440
No, I'm not.

460
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,420
I've never heard about it before.

461
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,640
Good.

462
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,560
How dare she do something like that?

463
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,520
How dare she?

464
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Tell her

465
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,200
that I won't buy that apartment for her!

466
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,760
I'll refund the deposit.

467
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,460
She can go wherever she wants!

468
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,720
She can go to the north pole if she wants,

469
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,520
let along Beijing.

470
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,920
I won't stop her anymore!

471
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
She and her father

472
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,120
have really hurt me.

473
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,200
Mrs. Qi, please don't think like that.

474
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,240
Just go back.

475
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,600
Your mother has left

476
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,580
and she asked me to tell you

477
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,800
that she wouldn't buy the apartment

478
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,440
and she would refund the deposit.

479
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
And you could go wherever you want,

480
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,940
including the north pole.

481
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,140
Did you really do that in the college entrance exam?

482
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,800
How could you?

483
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,820
You're unbelievable!

484
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,360
I'll keep paying the rent,

485
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,520
so keep the room

486
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
for me.

487
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,020
Are you sure you can go?

488
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,810
The leader promised

489
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,760
to take me

490
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,090
as long as I apply for it.

491
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,400
When?

492
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,760
In October.

493
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,920
After I apply for it,

494
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,720
they'll recruit someone

495
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
and I'll hand my work over to them.

496
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,280
How could she do that?

497
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
She had an answer sheet unfilled

498
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,560
on purpose!

499
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,120
How dare she?

500
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,400
What if she failed

501
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,160
to be admitted

502
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,420
into a key university?

503
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
She must have had the answer sheet unfilled

504
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,820
on the last day.

505
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,040
Someone like her

506
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,800
must be clear

507
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,960
how many points she could get.

508
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,000
Is that the point?

509
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
The point is

510
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
how she dare!

511
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
The point is

512
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
she was being stupid.

513
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,920
She could have applied for

514
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,360
a better college with journalism.

515
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
If she had got a better result,

516
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,890
she would have to study law.

517
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,800
So

518
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,720
it's like going to court,

519
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
if you don't fight

520
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
for your rights,

521
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,560
others will try

522
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,680
to manipulate you.

523
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,480
In the end, there are only two options,

524
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,760
giving up

525
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,690
or getting into a fight.

526
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,800
If she had been more resolute

527
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,360
at the very beginning,

528
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,360
it wouldn't have come

529
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,120
to this.

530
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,000
Take the chance to pursue her right now

531
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,720
if you're still in love with her.

532
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,680
What are you talking about?

533
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,800
I came here to watch the football game today

534
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
and I've moved on.

535
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,880
Here is to you. Come.

536
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,040
I really came here to watch the football game.

537
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,880
Cheers!

538
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,400
Coming.

539
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,890
Come in, please.

540
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,780
What brought you here?

541
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,370
Are you here to see Mingyue?

542
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,450
I really came here to watch the football game.

543
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,320
OK.

544
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Does he know what Mingyue did?

545
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,520
So

546
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,240
right now,

547
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
you should be proactive.

548
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,360
Someone like Mingyue

549
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,400
doesn't know

550
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,280
how to get along with the one she likes.

551
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,240
Deep down,

552
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,480
she doesn't think

553
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
that she deserves

554
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,000
to be loved.

555
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,000
She had an answer sheet unfilled on purpose!

556
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,720
Oh, my!

557
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,640
How bold and reckless she was!

558
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,720
This is unbelievable!

559
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,250
I really came here to watch the football game.

560
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
Why didn't you get some fried peanuts?

561
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,500
You don't eat night snack, do you?

562
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,320
I don't want to be an actress anymore.

563
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,840
I'll eat whatever I want!

564
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,960
You know what,

565
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,680
even if I put on ten jin,

566
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,730
I'll still be the most attractive girl in the museum.

567
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
Now I believe

568
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
that you're totally

569
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,200
over Zhuang Bei.

570
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,240
Look,

571
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,560
you're wearing no make-up

572
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,960
and you're chowing down.

573
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,200
I don't think

574
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,000
you're attracted

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,060
to any men present.

576
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,440
Yes.

577
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,320
Everyone

578
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,640
present now

579
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,360
is a good friend of mine.

580
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,600
Are you upset?

581
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,800
No.

582
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,770
So you're upset.

583
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
You answered it too quickly.

584
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,440
Life is full of troubles,

585
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,640
but we still should be happy.

586
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,880
Let's be happy.

587
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,680
Come.

588
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,560
Let's drink!

589
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,040
Come!

590
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,700
Bottoms up!

591
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,680
Come! Cheers!

592
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,840
Cheers!

593
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,540
Come, the one who came here to see Mingyue. Come!

594
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,960
Tang Can?

595
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,400
Are you drunk?

596
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,200
Do you know

597
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,240
how many calories there are

598
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,040
in this packet of fried peanuts?

599
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,000
It doesn't tell like that.

600
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,800
In addition to your normal diet every day,

601
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
if you eat one more handful of it,

602
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,680
you will gain ten jin after a year.

603
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,720
Really?

604
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,480
But I really,

605
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,640
really like

606
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,160
fried peanuts.

607
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,080
So eat it.

608
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,640
What's wrong with you?

609
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,280
Why are you

610
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,410
sighing and crying?

611
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,280
Mingyue's mother doesn't like me

612
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,210
and she looks down on me,

613
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,340
because I run errands for others.

614
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I fail the auditions

615
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,320
and I don't have a stable job.

616
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,760
I always waste money

617
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
on something useless,

618
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
especially clothes.

619
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,800
I buy a lot of clothes

620
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,280
and I fight against my parents.

621
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,800
Even I look down on myself.

622
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,880
I think I'm like

623
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
a hazardous waste.

624
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,400
And my only advantage now is

625
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
that I'm slender.

626
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,210
What kind of advantage is that?

627
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,040
But I always want to eat

628
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,280
fried peanuts.

629
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,520
It's OK.

630
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,360
You're no longer an actress,

631
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,160
so you can eat as much as you want.

632
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
There, there.

633
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,880
Don't cry.

634
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,360
Qi Mingyue's mother doesn't like you,

635
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,160
and you don't have

636
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,080
to like her.

637
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,280
You're great.

638
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,720
You're pretty and kind,

639
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
and my mother likes you a lot.

640
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,120
In her eyes,

641
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,920
you're a star.

642
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,120
You're a star!

643
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,140
Everyone in your family is a star!

644
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,200
I hate it the most

645
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
when others call me a star!

646
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,680
No, I mean

647
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,800
you don't have to punish yourself

648
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,720
because of

649
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,980
other's disapproval.

650
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
I think you're great.

651
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,760
I mean it.

652
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,460
You say one thing and do the other.

653
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,920
You despised my work

654
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
in your heart before.

655
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,760
When did I do that?

656
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,600
Oh, my! I've never done that!

657
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,140
Never mind.

658
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,850
It doesn't matter anymore.

659
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,560
Anyway, you're my friend

660
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,600
right now.

661
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,080
I can't cry.

662
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,640
There's a manager in the museum

663
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
who likes me.

664
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
If I cry too much, my eyes will be swollen

665
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,610
and it'll be hard to put on makeup the next day.

666
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,560
I weighed myself

667
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,400
and I gained 1.5 jin again!

668
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,920
OK. Come.

669
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,680
Let's change the subject.

670
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll show you a magic trick. Come.

671
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,560
Look at me.

672
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
Watch carefully.

673
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Do you believe that I can eat it

674
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,440
and then take it out from the back of my neck?

675
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,760
You don't believe it?

676
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Watch carefully.

677
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,600
Are you kidding me?

678
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,960
I'm not a kid anymore!

679
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Well, I have another magic trick

680
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
and it's amazing!

681
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,440
Watch it!

682
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,040
No!

683
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,100
Watch it. Watch it.

684
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Watch carefully.

685
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,880
Come closer!

686
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,480
Watch my mouth.

687
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,760
See?

688
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,240
You're so disgusting!

689
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
You must be kidding me!

690
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,800
I do have another magic trick. Would you like to see it?

691
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,520
I don't want to see it!

692
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,160
I don't want it!

693
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,120
Come on! Have a look.

694
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,600
And this.

695
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,480
Go away! Go away!

696
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,600
Watch it. Watch it.

697
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,280
No, I don't want it!

698
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,800
Come on. Have a look.

699
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,640
Do you want any suggestions?

700
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,560
If you do,

701
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,920
I think you should make

702
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,880
these lines harder,

703
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,720
so they could be sharper,

704
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,650
which makes them more endangered.

705
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,560
About this point,

706
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,800
I don't agree with you.

707
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,560
I think when the lines are soft

708
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,480
and the shapes are round,

709
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,680
it'll make people want to protect them more.

710
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,960
But it'll be not artistic enough

711
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,560
and it'll be too commercial.

712
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,000
Anyway, it's for charity.

713
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,400
So it doesn't matter.

714
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,400
By the way,

715
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,000
your senior fellow apprentice Yufei is going

716
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,320
to cooperate with an art gallery in Shanghai

717
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
to hold a sculpture exhibition

718
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,160
themed with the dream world.

719
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,040
Do you know that?

720
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,960
No.

721
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,980
He invited me, but not you?

722
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,560
It makes sense.

723
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
You're a famous artist,

724
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
but I'm too petty.

725
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,240
Li Jianjian,

726
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,720
what did you buy?

727
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,200
It's so heavy.

728
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
Thank you so much.

729
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,710
Oh, my!

730
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,090
I bought some special local products.

731
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,280
Ling Xiao's mother

732
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,760
is going back to Singapore

733
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,040
and I want to send her

734
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,739
some special local products.

735
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,440
Zhou Miao likes it.

736
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,960
Buy it for him yourself.

737
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,710
How petty!

738
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,710
Zhou Miao went to a date behind your back

739
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,570
and you'll still make up with him?

740
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,600
That girl has fallen for him

741
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,199
and keeps running after him.

742
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
It's because

743
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,760
Zhou Miao is such a great man.

744
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,280
I think Juan is right.

745
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,040
Love should be passionate

746
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,630
and blind

747
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,360
which demands great courage.

748
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
Right?

749
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,370
But there's

750
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,280
something wrong

751
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,360
with your relationship.

752
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,670
You've become like an old married couple

753
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,320
without going through the honeymoon period.

754
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,040
And you even bought special local products

755
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,080
to please your future mother-in-law.

756
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,960
Seriously?

757
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,760
Yeah.

758
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
I think you two can be a great couple.

759
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,780
You can think about it.

760
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,090
Wait a little while.

761
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,080
Let him eat when it's cool.

762
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,040
Don't get burnt.

763
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,160
Eat it, please.

764
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,480
Is there anything that Dongdong can't eat?

765
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,880
No.

766
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,320
There're no green onions.

767
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,640
Do you want green onions?

768
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,680
But I remember

769
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,840
you don't eat green onions,

770
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,440
so I didn't put them in yours.

771
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,140
You still remember it?

772
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,520
It's my habit.

773
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,960
I've watched the album

774
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,680
and I didn't know

775
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,480
that Ziqiu liked playing basketball

776
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,940
when he was in high school.

777
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,040
Well,

778
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,520
I didn't prepare it.

779
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,420
How about this?

780
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,920
I'll ask Jianjian

781
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,960
to print

782
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,440
the photos

783
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,400
for you.

784
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Thank you.

785
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,880
Don't say that.

786
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,960
Since you've come around,

787
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm really happy.

788
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,720
I used to think

789
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,820
it was better for him if I didn't contact him.

790
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,920
But I've thought about it

791
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,840
and I think you're right.

792
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,160
For his own good,

793
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,480
I should be nicer to him

794
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,330
and show him my concern.

795
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,400
Maybe

796
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,530
he doesn't need it anymore,

797
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,680
but it feels much better

798
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,040
when someone cares about us.

799
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,560
Yes, you're right.

800
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,300
You are the one who made me feel cared for.

801
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,800
But

802
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,680
I don't know what to do,

803
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,560
because I don't know him well

804
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,620
and I don't know what he likes.

805
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
Well,

806
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,440
he likes buying things for us.

807
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,720
He bought us a lot of things,

808
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,640
like the fridge

809
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,040
and the air conditioner.

810
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,210
And he likes buying bags for Jianjian.

811
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,720
He even

812
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,280
told me that he wanted

813
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,210
to marry Jianjian not long ago.

814
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,720
Really?

815
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,760
I think he just doesn't

816
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,080
feel secure,

817
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,120
so he wants to

818
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
on the same family register

819
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
with us.

820
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,320
Well, let's not talk about this.

821
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,800
Eat it.

822
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,680
Try it to see if you like it.

823
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,200
Try it.

824
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
Look, I haven't got you the chopsticks.

825
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,800
How could you try it without chopsticks?

826
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Thank you.

827
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,600
Yummy.

828
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,960
Dongdong, did you say

829
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,640
it's yummy?

830
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,920
I got it.

831
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,920
You like

832
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,000
the fish balls that I made you

833
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,240
the last time, right?

834
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,960
OK. OK.

835
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,080
If you like it,

836
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,840
I will make some more for you.

837
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,880
Come. Let's eat.

838
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,320
This is good.

839
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,720
Take a look at it.

840
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,040
I know.

841
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,960
They just had some noodles

842
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,240
in the restaurant.

843
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
It's not only having noodles. It's a date.

844
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,410
What date? I don't want to watch it.

845
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,720
Feel the vibe!

846
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,520
Isn't it strange?

847
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
There's nothing strange.

848
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,680
They're middle-aged,

849
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,520
and I don't think

850
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,280
they'll fall in love again.

851
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,720
You don't know it.

852
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,440
Have a look! Have a look!

853
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,680
No!

854
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
Ziqiu! Ziqiu!

855
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,080
No.

856
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,160
Don't do this in front of me.

857
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,760
Do it

858
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,360
in front of your boyfriend Ling Xiao.

859
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,890
Don't waste your time here.

860
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
I want some desserts.

861
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,540
Help yourself.

862
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,240
Why are there only two types?

863
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,500
Because I made only two types.

864
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,480
Are you running a fast food restaurant?

865
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,400
There're only Tiramisu cakes

866
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,760
and sandwiches.

867
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,800
Because no one buys my desserts.

868
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,080
Now the fast food

869
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,680
is much more popular.

870
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,240
Boss,

871
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,440
two sandwiches

872
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,520
and a fruit salad.

873
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,620
OK. Would you like some salad?

874
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,960
No.

875
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,040
Go ahead

876
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,500
and I'll work on my design.

877
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
OK, help yourself.

878
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,940
Hello, are you having a good time?

879
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,920
Brother,

880
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,880
will you

881
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,120
come back now?

882
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,200
You're back?

883
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,250
Shouldn’t you come back tomorrow?

884
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,080
Come and talk to mom!

885
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,680
She doesn’t listen to me!
