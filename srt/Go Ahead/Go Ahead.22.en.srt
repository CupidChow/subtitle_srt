1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,910
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Episode 22

4
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,720
Eat slowly,

5
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,830
or you might suffer from indigestion at night.

6
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,750
I feel sticky,

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,240
and I want to finish my dinner quickly and go back for a shower.

8
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,630
Yummy.

9
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm going back home.

10
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,440
Finish your dinner quickly.

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,270
I bring Aeroplane Chess to play with you.

12
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,079
Have one more pork rib.

13
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,550
You've lost some weight, so you should have more ribs.

14
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,110
Hurry up.

15
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Ziqiu is so kind

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
to Jianjian.

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
He's been kind to Jianjian since his childhood.

18
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,470
In my opinion,

19
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,000
you can just accept him as your son-in-law.

20
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,360
I think that's possible.

21
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,550
Otherwise, if Ziqiu

22
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,670
has a wife in the future,

23
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,030
probably you will become estranged.

24
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,320
Maybe Ziqiu's wife

25
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
will go serve his own dad with filial respect.

26
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,320
Do you think so?

27
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,910
Jianjian has a boyfriend,

28
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,390
one of her peers

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
who is also engaged in sculpture.

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,270
An artist?

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,630
He can earn a lot, right?

32
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,800
I don't know.

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,800
But I think

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,830
Jianjian should marry

35
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,600
someone you're quite familiar with.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
Have your noodles quickly.

37
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,320
Go on with your work.

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,470
Go. Go.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,750
Dad.

40
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,750
Eat slowly.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,880
There's something else tasting nice for you.

42
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,750
Ziqiu.

43
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:40,390
Mrs. Qian.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,550
Do you have any news

45
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,630
about your mom?

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,240
No.

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,440
Neither does your dad?

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,240
She's never

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,960
contacted us on her own initiative.

50
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,960
Then you should

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,910
convince your dad.

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
Let him rest assured

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,550
and not always think about being deceived by your mom.

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,670
In this world,

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,360
there are more women

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
who want to live and cherish their life.

57
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Do you think so?

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,110
Yes.

59
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,750
As your dad is still young,

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,600
it's easy for him to seek a wife.

61
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,000
But it will be hard for him

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,390
in several years.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,270
OK.

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,960
All right.

65
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,830
Cut the crap.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,920
You should take this seriously.

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,040
If you and your siblings are married

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,510
and fly away from the nest

69
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,230
like little birds,

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,110
who will take care of your dad?

71
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,600
Unlike him,

72
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,160
I have my husband

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,040
who can call 120 for an ambulance

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,110
if I have a cerebral infarction,

75
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,040
cerebral palsy, cerebral thrombus

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,230
or something like that,

77
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,160
What if that happens to your dad?

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
To wait for death at home?

79
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,720
Don't talk nonsense about death,

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,200
or you might scare Ziqiu.

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm not scaring him.

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm telling the truth.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,600
This is what we elders

84
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,760
take into consideration.

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,390
You are too young to understand that.

86
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,110
Exactly, I'm young.

87
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,760
The pork ribs look quite attractive!

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,230
Mrs. Qian, you know,

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
I cooked the sweet and sour spare ribs

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,830
for my children.

91
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,320
You can't eat such food because of your diabetes.

92
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,550
I just want to try it.

93
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,760
Nice.

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,550
Just one piece.

95
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,950
One piece is enough.

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,880
Ziqiu,

97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,550
you'd better take a shower before coming upstairs.

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,440
It's really comfortable to enjoy the breeze up here.

99
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,790
You...

100
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,390
What brings you back?

101
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm back to visit Dad.

102
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,720
Ziqiu is back too?

103
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,270
You want to avoid me?

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,790
No, no, no.

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,320
No.

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Why are you back?

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm back to get something.

108
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,830
What are you thinking about?

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Ziqiu has been the one you prefer

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,950
since your childhood, right?

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's wrong with you again?

112
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,320
After Ziqiu came to our family,

113
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,350
he was always the first

114
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,390
you thought of

115
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,830
to take revenge for you when you were bullied.

116
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,790
Without letting me know, you went to play in the game hall,

117
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,160
play in the net bar,

118
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,350
and make trouble.

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
You did everything without me.

120
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,830
You didn't allow me to fight，

121
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,200
or play video games.

122
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,440
You disciplined me in every aspect.

123
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
In the middle of the night, you secretly

124
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
ate spicy strips in the quilt

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,270
without me.

126
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,670
That's because you lived upstairs.

127
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,720
How could we ask you to eat with us?

128
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Moreover,

129
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,600
after brushing your teeth,

130
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,550
you wouldn't eat anything.

131
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,230
I have a clear conscience, and the sun and the moon are my witnesses.

132
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,670
Both the palm and the back of the hand are made of flesh (Both are of equal importance).

133
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,390
Ling Xiao.

134
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,070
They are different.

135
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,830
Although both of them are made of flesh,

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,830
when people get hurt,

137
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,320
they always clench their fist

138
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,390
to protect their palm.

139
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,230
Am I the palm or the back of the hand?

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,920
I love their noodles so much.

141
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,640
They are really tasty.

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,350
That's true.

143
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,550
Let's come again another day.

144
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,200
Listen.

145
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200
You should lose weight.

146
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,270
I'll start to lose weight tomorrow.

147
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,070
Come on.

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,790
Why are you back?

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,070
You came at a good time.

150
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,670
Take the duck I just marinated

151
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,880
back home and eat with Jianjian.

152
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,510
Dad,

153
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,670
I want to tell you something.

154
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,390
So,

155
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,669
she broke up with Zheng

156
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,030
like that?

157
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,710
They were friends.

158
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,230
Now,

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
they become friends again.

160
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,790
Well, you

161
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,760
like Jianjian.

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,670
What does Jianjian feel?

163
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,520
I haven't told her yet.

164
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,200
I want to

165
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,200
ask your permission first.

166
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
What if I don't agree?

167
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,080
Then

168
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
I'll tell her

169
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
after you agree.

170
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,790
What if Jianjian doesn't agree?

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,760
I'll chase her

172
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,520
and be better to her

173
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
than before.

174
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,840
I'll do my best.

175
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,110
Dad,

176
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,840
Dad,

177
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,880
are you angry?

178
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,400
Our relatives said,

179
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,230
"Ziqiu is

180
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,880
quiet all day.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
He is certainly like his mom,

182
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,350
a cold stone that cannot become warm.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
He takes Jianjian

184
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,550
to make trouble outside

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,470
and Jianjian becomes a bad girl when staying with him."

186
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,670
I know

187
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,350
the aunts

188
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,230
talked a lot about that

189
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,110
behind my back.

190
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,030
But they don't know

191
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,880
that among the three of you,

192
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,710
you are the most honest.

193
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Jianjian

194
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,150
always went out to make trouble.

195
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,470
You went with her

196
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
because you were afraid she would get hurt.

197
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,960
But she

198
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,350
always framed you.

199
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,110
And you willingly

200
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,350
took the blame for her.

201
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,790
Ling Xiao couldn't let her listen to him,

202
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
so he got angry with you too.

203
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,350
Actually she didn't frame me.

204
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,200
She was afraid that you would scold her.

205
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,110
You've grown up.

206
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,880
You have your own thoughts.

207
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,910
I can't intervene.

208
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,280
Dad,

209
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,200
I feel

210
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
you are angry.

211
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,590
No, I'm not angry.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,150
But I really didn't expect that the two of you...

213
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,230
How about this?

214
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,200
Give me some time.

215
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,590
Let me digest it.

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,200
You should think about it.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,470
Dad,

218
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,710
I've already thought about it.

219
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,320
I sincerely...

220
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,150
I don't doubt your sincerity.

221
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,640
I mean romance

222
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
is really not stable.

223
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,910
Look. Jianjian and Zheng's relationship

224
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,230
didn't last long

225
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,110
before coming to an end, right?

226
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,440
If you don't

227
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,910
become lovers，

228
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,110
don't forget

229
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,200
the bond

230
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
between you

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,280
since your childhood.

232
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,000
Ziqiu,

233
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,910
you must promise me.

234
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,960
Even if you cannot

235
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,030
become lovers,

236
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,590
you must return.

237
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,960
Continue to be her brother.

238
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,790
OK?

239
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,590
OK.

240
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,710
Dad,

241
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,150
I promise you.

242
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,470
Why?

243
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,910
Why did mosquitoes only bite me?

244
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,080
Why didn't they bite you?

245
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,080
They bully the weak and fear the strong.

246
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,030
Your body temperature is high,

247
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,200
so mosquitoes like you.

248
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,400
I can manage it myself.

249
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,640
You, you go back.

250
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,470
You could

251
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,000
only make a cross

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
on the mosquito bites

253
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,910
with your nails, right?

254
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,150
Think about

255
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,670
what I said to you.

256
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,710
You could try it with Zheng Shuran.

257
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,520
Why can't you try it with me?

258
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,520
How can we try this at will?

259
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,880
The case of Zheng Shuran and I

260
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,960
was unsuccessful.

261
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,000
Anyway, I don't care.

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,670
From today on,

263
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,840
you must change your way of thinking.

264
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,320
Treat me as a man.

265
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,150
If the cow doesn't drink water, you can't

266
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,000
force it to drink by pressing its head, right?

267
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,840
I won't force you,

268
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,030
but if you want to drink water,

269
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,080
there is only one bowl in front of you

270
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,200
and you can't avoid it.

271
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,550
Besides, I think it is necessary to tell

272
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,400
people around us,

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
so as not to let others think

274
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,710
I have and inexplicably dubious relationship with someone else.

275
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,110
Did you tell Qi Mingyue?

276
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,840
No.

277
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,470
At present, I've only told Feng Xixi.

278
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,520
I didn't plan

279
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,280
to tell others,

280
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
but they all regard me

281
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,030
as your brother.

282
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,000
That is an obstacle

283
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,080
to the relationship between us.

284
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,200
No, no, there is no obstacle.

285
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,230
Calm down first.

286
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,470
I don't think that is

287
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,440
a big problem.

288
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,200
We can

289
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,280
solve the problem in private.

290
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,550
How?

291
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,080
Let me think about it.

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,200
Let me think about it.

293
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,150
I'll first put this bowl of water

294
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,030
in front of me.

295
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,640
OK?

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,520
OK.

297
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,440
Should I

298
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
tell Ziqiu?

299
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,440
No, no.

300
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,280
You can't tell Ziqiu especially.

301
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,880
If he knows, he'll be mad.

302
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,230
He'll think we

303
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,000
isolate him.

304
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
He'll make a scene.

305
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,000
OK.

306
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,550
That fool is one track-minded.

307
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,470
It is good for him not to know.

308
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,710
OK.

309
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't tell him.

310
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,150
Well.

311
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,640
You apply it to your legs.

312
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,710
I'm going back to take a shower.

313
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,840
Go to bed early.

314
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,080
You too. Have a good sleep.

315
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,640
Have a good sleep.

316
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,640
You know,

317
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
I can't sleep well.

318
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,960
It is hard for me to have a good sleep.

319
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,790
Today, you made a promise

320
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,550
to me,

321
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,080
but if you avoid me again

322
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,150
like what you've done these days,

323
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,350
I'll sleep worse.

324
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,470
What? Ling Xiao,

325
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,350
you are threatening me

326
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,150
with your health?

327
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,110
I'm just stating the fact.

328
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,230
Goodnight.

329
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,840
Having studied in Singapore for a few years,

330
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,280
you become stupid.

331
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,400
Idiot!

332
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,350
Whom can you threaten?

333
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,470
Am I, Li Jianjian, the person

334
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,470
you can threaten?

335
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,670
I must have owed you anything in my previous life.

336
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,150
Ziqiu.

337
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,400
You startled me.

338
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,910
You scared me.

339
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,670
Oh, by the way,

340
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,760
I saw Ling Xiao going upstairs.

341
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,030
Ignore him.

342
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,520
Come here now.

343
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
Apply the medicated oil to my legs for me.

344
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,030
I'm suffering from mosquito bites.

345
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,150
Why can you attract mosquitoes so easily?

346
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,760
Ling Xiao said that is because my body temperature is high.

347
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,710
Why?

348
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,230
Are you still angry with Ling Xiao?

349
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,910
I heard Dad say

350
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,030
on the day Ling Xiao came back,

351
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,470
he immediately went to offer incense to

352
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,110
your mom.

353
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,960
No, no.

354
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,670
I'm not angry with him.

355
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,670
I still feel

356
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,200
it is comfortable to stay with you.

357
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,710
Really?

358
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,640
Yes.

359
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,470
It itches here.

360
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,200
Don't scratch it.

361
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,760
Let me apply the medicated oil to your leg

362
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
and rub it for you.

363
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,550
And there.

364
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,110
I know. I know.

365
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,030
Don't scratch. Don't scratch.

366
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,710
Li Jianjian,

367
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,670
I want to talk about something with you.

368
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,320
I want to know whether you agree or not.

369
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,590
Go ahead.

370
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
You said

371
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,440
it's comfortable

372
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,520
to stay with me, right?

373
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,400
Let's

374
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,400
be together, OK?

375
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,230
What do you mean?

376
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
I don't want to be your brother.

377
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,230
I want to be your boyfriend.

378
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,550
Let me finish.

379
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,080
I've thought about it.

380
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,030
I can't trust any man

381
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,670
to marry you.

382
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,350
In this world,

383
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,350
no man cares about you

384
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,320
more than me.

385
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,790
I must take care of you myself

386
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,670
so that I can rest assured.

387
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,520
After we get married,

388
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,760
let's live together as before.

389
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,550
That is to say, I'll marry into your family.

390
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,109
The family structure

391
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,069
won't change.

392
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,430
Besides, when we have a child,

393
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,400
I can take care of him or her.

394
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Are you crazy?

395
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,190
He Ziqiu, what's wrong with you?

396
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,400
How can I calm down?

397
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,190
How can I calm down?

398
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,310
I treat you as my brother,

399
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,829
but you want me to have a child with you.

400
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,310
I'm telling you,

401
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,430
if my dad knows that,

402
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,190
what will he feel?

403
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,589
I've already talked with Dad.

404
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,710
He asked me to think about it.

405
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,280
I've already thought about it.

406
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,920
Li Jianjian. Li Jianjian.

407
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,589
Sit down!

408
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,950
Sit down.

409
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,160
I talked with Dad

410
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,350
because we can't do this

411
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,400
in secret, right?

412
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,590
Whom else did you tell this to?

413
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,800
Zhuang Bei.

414
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,110
He guessed it.

415
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,520
Don't worry.

416
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,160
I won't let everybody

417
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,880
know this to make things difficult for you.

418
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,350
You can just

419
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,710
spare some

420
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,830
leisure time

421
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,520
to think about it and adjust to it.

422
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,160
Then should I

423
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
often come back home with you?

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,070
Thank you.

425
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,000
You're welcome.

426
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,110
Don't tell this to Ling Xiao.

427
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,110
He is...

428
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,350
There is something wrong with his mind.

429
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,110
Don't make him

430
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,950
become worse.

431
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,880
I know his brain always

432
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,520
doesn't work well.

433
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,590
When we are together...

434
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,400
It is impossible for us to be together.

435
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,880
I'll work hard to be good to you.

436
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,190
Livid lightning flares

437
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,350
in storm clouds

438
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,350
high above the seething ocean

439
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,830
and the flaming darts are captured

440
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,520
and extinguished

441
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,430
by the waters.

442
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,680
Come on.

443
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,470
I'm talking with you seriously.

444
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,040
Why are you reciting

445
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,280
"The Song of the Stormy Petrel" to me?

446
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,710
While the reflections of this lightning,

447
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,430
just like serpents made of fire,

448
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,920
weave in the sea...

449
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,470
Writhe...

450
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,590
They writhe in the sea,

451
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,830
disappearing in a flash.

452
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,190
Tempest!

453
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,590
Soon will strike the tempest!

454
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,350
That is the courageous Petrel

455
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,590
proudly soaring in the lightning

456
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,230
over the sea's

457
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,680
roar of fury.

458
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,190
That is the prophet's

459
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,000
cries of victory.

460
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,710
Let the tempest come

461
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,680
strike harder!

462
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,310
Stormy Petrel,

463
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,160
you didn't bring your shoes in.

464
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,880
I'll work hard

465
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,470
to be good to you.

466
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,520
I'm going back to my room.

467
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,710

The expenses.

Jianjian hasn't got up yet?

494
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,920
She has already left.

495
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,470
She left home at half past six.

496
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,000
She has a lot work to do in her studio.

497
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,000
I put the breakfast in her bag.

498
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,400
Ziqiu.

499
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,830
Yes?

500
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,800
The two of us have talked.

501
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,110
There is something

502
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,590
that we don't want to hide from you.

503
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,950
What did you hide from me?

504
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,000
During the summer holiday

505
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,310
in your third year at high school,

506
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,590
your mom came back once.

507
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,000
She, she, she came back to pay back the money to me.

508
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,950
She paid off the money

509
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,040
she had borrowed from me.

510
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,760
But at the time

511
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,350
she asked me

512
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,830
not to tell you.

513
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,640
So, I didn't mention that to you.

514
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,160
Your mom

515
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,680
is not so good,

516
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,000
or so bad.

517
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,430
So we don't want you

518
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,230
to keep that thing

519
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,800
in our mind.

520
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,040
Just let it go if you can.

521
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,160
I didn't keep it in my mind.

522
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,920
I've long forgotten that.

523
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
That's good.

524
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,800
I thought too much.

525
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,040
I see you often touch

526
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,230
that small mirror,

527
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:17,950
so, so, so,

528
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,560
so I asked him

529
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,920
to inquire about

530
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,920
where she is.

531
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,590
After inquiring

532
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,400
about where she is,

533
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,760
he found that she is in the local area.

534
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,110
So, so I went to

535
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,310
see her.

536
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,800
Here is her current situation.

537
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,040
She is running a beauty salon.

538
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
It has been a few years.

539
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,920
The business is good.

540
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,350
But she

541
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,920
has remarried.

542
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,350
She has another child

543
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,920
who is over four years old.

544
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,350
A little boy.

545
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,430
According to what she said, it seems that

546
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,470
she hasn't mentioned you

547
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,560
to her husband.

548
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,400
She has a family now.

549
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,430
She has another child.

550
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,680
Very good.

551
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,760
I, I,

552
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,000
I think,

553
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,470
she didn't contact you

554
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,350
for your own good.

555
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,230
After all, the knot is too deep

556
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,110
in your heart.

557
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,110
So, it's

558
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,110
up to you.

559
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,230
You decide

560
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,350
whether to see her or not.

561
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,000
Does she

562
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,760
know I'm back?

563
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,400
Yes.

564
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,190
Does she want to see me?

565
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,190
Why do I go to see her?

566
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
I won't go to see her.

567
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,070
You must go to see her.

568
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,110
Tell her

569
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,760
that since she hasn't

570
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
done her duty as a parent,

571
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:54,920
if anything happens

572
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
in the future,

573
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,430
don't come to you

574
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,830
and ask you to take responsibility.

575
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,710
No need to feel sad.

576
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,190
Without our moms, we didn't starve to death in our childhood.

577
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
If we want something,

578
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,040
we can strive for it.

579
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,590
We can only become better and better.

580
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,520
Dad,

581
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,230
Mr. Li,

582
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,950
you guys continue.

583
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,710
I'm going to work.

584
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,880
You, you ate so little.

585
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,880
Be careful on your way.

586
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,560
Hamburger.

587
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,310
Eat.

588
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,830
There is one for your grandma.

589
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,920
Go on.

590
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,430
Mom,

591
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,680
taste this.

592
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,640
and have a break there.

593
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,950
Mom,

594
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,070
won't you get married

595
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,070
with Mr. Li?

596
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,230
No, I won't.

597
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,040
Why?

598
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,310
Because there is no love between us.

599
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,040
What is love?

600
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,110
Without it, you won't get married?

601
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,470
Without love, we can also get married.

602
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,760
But

603
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,350
I won't be happy.

604
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,470
Why won't you be happy?

605
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,000
Living with Mr. Li

606
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,830
and Li Jianjian

607
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,760
is something happy, isn't it?

608
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,350
I'm very happy.

609
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,350
You like Li Haichao

610
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,070
and his daughter so much?

611
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,800
Yes.

612
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,310
Mr. Li is kind to me.

613
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,680
How does he treat you?

614
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,590
He cooks a lot of good food,

615
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,800
smiles at me and washes clothes for me.

616
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,190
Yes.

617
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,470
He is better than me.

618
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,430
I like Mom best.

619
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,110
Remember this.

620
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,830
At your grandma's,

621
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,280
you must listen to what she says.

622
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,160
After I find a job

623
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,350
in Shenzhen,

624
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,950
I'll come back to take you there.

625
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,470
Even if there is gold here and there in Shenzhen,

626
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,190
will it be your turn to dig it?

627
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,560
I thought you became smart

628
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,830
after suffering.

629
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,070
You are a divorced woman

630
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,160
with a child.

631
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,310
Isn't it good to marry someone

632
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,190
who is honest?

633
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,230
So you still want to be a gold digger?

634
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,110
In the presence of the child,

635
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,590
you even talked about love.

636
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,950
Shame on you!

637
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,400
Mom,

638
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,400
I'll send you money.

639
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,920
Support yourself

640
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,310
before you do anything else.

641
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,430
Don't talk big.

642
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,470
Raising a daughter is useless.

643
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,640
These years,

644
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,000
you haven't helped our family at all.

645
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,880
Fine.

646
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,880
But now I have to support your child.

647
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,000
You are completely a money-losing proposition.

648
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,350
Mom,

649
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,350
I'll show filial piety to you.

650
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,190
Go! Go!

651
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,400
I've seen enough of

652
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,160
your face.

653
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,830
Go! Go!

654
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,800
Go!

655
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,160
Ziqiu,

656
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,830
be good.

657
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,040
Listen to your grandma and Aunt He Lan.

658
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,110
After a period,

659
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,230
I'll come back to take you with me.

660
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,310
Mom,

661
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,110
you are not in good health.

662
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,430
You must pay attention to your health.

663
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,110
Don't be so angry.

664
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,760
You have high blood pressure,

665
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,590
so, don't forget to take hypotensive drugs.

666
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,310
Thank you for taking care of Ziqiu.

667
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,920
I'll send you money.

668
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,830
Mom,

669
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,190
come back early to take me with you.

670
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Mom,

671
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,760
come back early to take me with you.

672
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,830
Mom,

673
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,190
come back early!

674
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,310
Mom,

675
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,470
come back early to take me with you!

676
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,040
Sir,

677
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,280
are you looking for someone?

678
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,400
I,

679
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,830
I want to see your boss,

680
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,560
He Mei.

681
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,950
To see our boss?

682
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,160
Who are you?

683
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,230
I'm,

684
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm her friend's son.

685
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,560
Well,

686
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,640
come in and wait for her.

687
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,830
She is sending her child

688
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,760
to the kindergarten.

689
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,520
I guess

690
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,110
she'll be back in about half an hour.

691
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,160
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

692
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,640
I have something else to do later.

693
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,190
How about this?

694
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,560
I,

695
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,560
I'll give you an address.

696
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,160
When she is back, remember

697
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,560
to tell her

698
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,160
that if she has time today,

699
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,590
she can go to see me,

700
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,950
and that if she doesn't have time today,

701
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,190
I'll come again tomorrow.

702
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,040
OK.

703
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:02,880
Oh, right.

704
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,800
My name is

705
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,760
Ziqiu.

706
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,430
OK. No problem.

707
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,400
Thank you.

708
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,880
You're welcome.

709
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,520
Li Jianjian!

710
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,470
Yes?

711
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,160
Li Jianjian!

712
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,800
Jianjian.

713
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,590
What's going on?

714
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,880
I'm telling you.

715
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,350
We are going to do international business.

716
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,310
An international

717
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,070
handicraft company

718
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,040
e-mailed me.

719
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,000
They want to buy

720
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
the derivative copyright

721
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,070
of your Two Boys and A Girl.

722
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,310
Really?

723
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,040
Yes.

724
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,590
In China,

725
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,950
they have handicraft production lines.

726
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,110
That is, when you

727
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,110
buy a handicraft abroad,

728
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,040
later you find that

729
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,160
it is made in China.

730
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,040
I've searched the company's information.

731
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,160
They have made a lot of domestic and foreign artists'

732
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,520
derivative works.

733
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,400
Why are you like this?

734
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,110
You know what?

735
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,830
Once a piece of work is sold,

736
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,280
we can get a percentage of the money.

737
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,830
We'll make a fortune.

738
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,070
I've invited their person in charge

739
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,190
to our studio

740
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,400
to talk about the business these days.

741
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,950
Good.

742
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,680
Congratulations, two bosses.

743
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,000
Money and treasures will be plentiful.

744
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,830
Juan,

745
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,640
when you get rich,

746
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,560
will you dump me

747
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,800
and find someone younger?

748
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,830
That will really be too...

749
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,710
It depends on your performance.

750
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,160
What is that you just sat on?

751
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,080
"Perplexed Because of Being Spoiled by My Brother".

752
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,520
I'm simply curious.

753
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,120
Li Jianjian,

754
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,040
Although I told you

755
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,280
about the department of orthopedics,

756
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,560
I advise you

757
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,840
not to read it

758
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,190
as you are in such a situation.

759
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,630
Why?

760
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,520
More often than not,

761
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,870
it is like after a switch is turned on,

762
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,670
something may get out of control.

763
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,710
You'll feel

764
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,600
this kind of setting seems

765
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,120
gives you a sense of substitution.

766
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,520
It makes sense.

767
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,360
Originally, many things may not happen.

768
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,760
But when there is more autosuggestion,

769
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,870
you'll think much.

770
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,389
You can't read it. You can't read it.

771
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,120
You'd better think about

772
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,429
your work for the competition.

773
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Didn't you agree to take part in

774
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,870
the invitational tournament of on-site creation？

775
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,429
Think about the theme.

776
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,040
I don't feel inspired.

777
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,800
Juan,

778
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,840
if Miss Li's works

779
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,950
sell better and better,

780
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,710
will she dissolve a partnership with you?

781
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,520
How is it possible?

782
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,560
I handle all the studio's affairs

783
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,630
outside and in.

784
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,840
The Taobao store,

785
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,080
business connection,

786
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,600
and negotiation with customers, I take charge of all these things, right?

787
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,870
Jianjian is mainly focused

788
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,870
on creating works.

789
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,870
We each perform our own function.

790
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,000
We cannot be separated from each other.

791
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,390
Be that as it may,

792
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,360
when you make less money, it won't matter,

793
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,190
but when you make much money, things will change.

794
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,000
The core competitiveness is the content.

795
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,470
The one who provides creativity is the key.

796
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,190
You'd better

797
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,560
sign a contract with her.

798
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,910
I'm warning you.

799
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,520
Don't say such words again.

800
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,870
Jianjian is not such a person.

801
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,320
Don't be annoyed.

802
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,430
You are so kind,

803
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,150
and I'm afraid that you'll suffer losses.

804
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,560
Well. Well.

805
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,950
Go to work.

806
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,040
OK.

807
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,560
You can recommend some desserts to me.

808
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,470
Small square cream cake and tiramisu.

809
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,390
I want a piece of tiramisu

810
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,840
and a piece of small square cream cake.

811
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,150
OK. You can read the menu

812
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,600
to see whether there is

813
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,710
anything you want to drink.

814
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,080
I just want those.

815
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,230
OK.

816
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,040
Thank you.

817
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,870
Please wait a moment.

818
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,360
Boss, the customer wants cakes.

819
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,390
Boss,

820
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,760
the customer wants cakes.

821
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,230
What does she want?

822
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,230
A piece of small square cream cake

823
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,360
and a piece of tiramisu.

824
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,190
OK. Wait a second.

825
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,800
Here you are.

826
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,910
Boss,

827
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,760
the customer says the small square cream cake

828
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,670
is not sweet at all.

829
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,230
Powdered sugar wasn't added in the cream.

830
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,710
It's OK. You go

831
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,280
to withdraw the cake I made before,

832
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
and ask if we can serve the customers with another type cake.

833
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,600
OK.

834
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Are you not feeling well?

835
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,950
No.

836
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm fine. Go on with your work.

837
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,230
Who is that?

838
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,230
Hello, I'm here to see Li Jianjian.

839
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,470
Jianjian.

840
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,670
Ling Xiao.

841
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,950
What brings you here?

842
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,000
You don't need to work today?

843
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,390
I have a noon break today.

844
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,870
I want to take you to have lunch.

845
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,000
Why didn't you call me?

846
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,150
My cellphone is out of work.

847
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,190
I want you to go and buy one with me.

848
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,320
Won't you introduce us to each other?

849
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,600
This is Du Juan, my senior schoolmate.

850
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,560
This is Ling Xiao, my brother.

851
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,120
Hello, Ling Xiao.

852
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,760
I've heard a lot about you.

853
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,870
Thank you for taking care

854
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,670
of Jianjian.

855
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,950
You're welcome.

856
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,560
That's what I should do.

857
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,120
You made a mistake.

858
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,230
Although she is my senior schoolmate,

859
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,600
I always take care of her.

860
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,870
Say something nice when a handsome guy is here.

861
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,000
I'll treat you to a dinner next time.

862
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,390
I don't have enough time today.

863
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,230
Be sure to treat us. Mean what you say.

864
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,360
Next time, we can ask Jianjian's

865
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,120
the other brother to have dinner with us.

866
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,910
OK!

867
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,150
Let's go. Let's go.

868
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,630
Ling Xiao, I'm hungry. Let's go to eat.

869
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,600
Let's go.

870
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,190
See you. See you.

871
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,120
Before you went to university,

872
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,630
they had just started building this mall.

873
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,470
Do you still remember?

874
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,360
It was put into operation a long time ago.

875
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,120
There is a cell phone store ahead.

876
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,430
And the restaurants are on the fourth floor here.

877
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,230
It is very convenient.

878
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,320
You left home early in the morning.

879
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,280
You avoided me.

880
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,670
You went back on your word.

881
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,470
I didn't avoid you.

882
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,080
I just feel

883
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,230
that when our dads

884
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,710
see our current situation, I'm afraid

885
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,150
of being found out.

886
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,190
You can just behave as you did before.

887
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,630
I also want to behave as I did before.

888
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,560
But why don't you guys

889
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,800
live your life?

890
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,040
You guys?

891
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,150
Don't find fault with wording.

892
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,950
Just you.

893
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,800
You should treat Ziqiu

894
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,600
and me differently.

895
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,560
He is your brother.

896
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,600
He'll accompany you to my home on our wedding day.

897
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
There you go again.

898
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,190
Give me your hand.

899
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,190
I...

900
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,280
If I give you my hand, I won't feel free.

901
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,430
Then I give you my hand.

902
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,710
You want me to hold your hand, right?

903
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,520
During our childhood, you often held my hand

904
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,040
as if you held a dog.

905
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,390
Let's go and buy a cellphone.

906
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,670
OK. That's all.

907
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,910
OK. Please wait a moment.

908
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,950
When my cell phone was out of work last time,

909
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,870
I took it to be repaired

910
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,670
in the early morning on the next day.

911
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,910
But you can actually endure it for a few days

912
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,840
without using your cell phone.

913
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,000
Without it, I feel quiet.

914
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,360
Anyway,

915
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,560
people I need to keep close contact

916
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,360
are just around me.

917
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,800
Don't you visit

918
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,190
Weibo and public accounts?

919
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,120
No.

920
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,470
Wow!

921
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,230
You really haven't followed anything.

922
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,040
You have a lot of unread messages.

923
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,840
Read them.

924
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,760
What's the matter?

925
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,670
Mingyue sent you a WeChat message.

926
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,280
Read what she said.

927
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,150
You can read.

928
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,670
I don't think it is proper.

929
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,760
After I read it, I'll tell you.

930
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,630
Is there a difference?

931
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,230
You don't need to give me an answer.

932
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,190
I saw you kissing Li Jianjian.

933
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,390
I thought too much

934
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,520
and misunderstood.

935
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,630
These days, I'll find a house

936
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,840
and move out as soon as possible.

937
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,630
Please make your relationship public

938
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,470
after I move away.

939
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,430
Thank you.

940
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,800
What did she say to me?

941
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,470
You made things difficult for me.
