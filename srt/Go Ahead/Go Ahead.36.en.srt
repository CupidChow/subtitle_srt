1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 36

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,240
Why are you looking at me?

5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,000
I've talked with your brother about it.

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,760
about it.

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,920
You can come with me tomorrow,

8
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,040
but you must obey my rules.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
OK, I will listen to you.

10
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,960
First, you can't eat durians.

11
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,240
I just had one segment.

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,300
But that was enough to put people off.

13
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,680
Second,

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,840
after sitting on that chair for a whole day,

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,500
your bottom must hurt, right?

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,920
It's none of your business.

17
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
Of course, it's my business,

18
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,530
because you're with me.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,880
If you're not happy, don't follow me.

20
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,740
Any more rules?

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,600
Third,

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,240
you're not a little girl anymore.

23
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,200
You've never earned a penny,

24
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,060
but you spend like you're loaded.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,000
How about

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,360
you come and work in my shop

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,920
during this summer holiday?

28
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,160
You'll have a chance to experience

29
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,490
how hard life really is.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,280
If you're not willing

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,200
to work,

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
you can shop for furniture with mom tomorrow,

33
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,780
and do what she tells you to do.

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
Do you really want her back?

35
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,400
Do something.

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,880
What can I do?

37
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,240
She's never cared about

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
how I feel.

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,280
If she cared,

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I wouldn't have come back until now.

41
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,340
Aren't you aware of it?

42
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,180
I'm going to have a shower.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,770
You can talk with Ziqiu.

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,090
What did Ling Xiao mean?

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,600
What did he mean by

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,730
"I wouldn't have come back until now"?

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,730
What do I need to do in your shop?

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
Make coffee,

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
and some simple food.

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
Do some cleaning as well.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,890
Don't worry, I'll ask someone to teach you tomorrow.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,240
Since our son has been looking after you for so many years,

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,900
you should know better than me

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,690
how exhausting and hard

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,940
this can be for him.

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,970
With your current health conditions,

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,320
you still depend on him for care,

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
which I understand,

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,280
and I have no problem with it.

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,540
But there's one thing.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,560
At the moment, our son

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,779
is suffering from very severe mental problems.

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,440
He always stays up

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
all night.

65
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,690
He takes loads of drugs,

66
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
including anti-anxiety drugs

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,930
and anti-depressants.

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,480
As his parents,

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,159
we should make his health our priority.

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,720
Don't tell me

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
you're not aware of his illness.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,640
Mom.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,480
What medicine were you taking?

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Vitamins.

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,360
They help me focus better at work.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Actually, you need to

77
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,250
eat properly every day.

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,240
See how thin you are.

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,450
Vitamins can't provide everything you need.

80
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Got it.

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
Ms. Chen,

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,380
do you remember me?

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm Ling Xiao's colleague,

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Feng Xixi.

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,400
I remember.

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
Are you waiting for Ling Xiao?

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,320
I saw he has appointments today.

88
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
I know.

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,680
I just dropped in to see him.

90
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,010
Nothing too important.

91
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
What's the matter?

92
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,580
Nothing. I just think you're pretty.

93
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
Have you got a boy friend?

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,960
Not yet.

95
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Among the male doctors in our hospital,

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
the ones I consider nice

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,520
are either married

98
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
or have girlfriends.

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,400
What do you think

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,880
of Ling Xiao?

101
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,840
Ling Xiao has a girlfriend.

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
Hasn't he told you?

103
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,680
He hasn't mentioned it.

104
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
You know, boys

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
are not like girls.

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,760
It's better to have daughters,

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
as they tell their moms everything.

108
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,120
Boys are not as sensitive as girls.

109
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,520
You have to ask him directly.

110
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,840
It's better to ask you.

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,460
Let's add each other on WeChat, shall we?

112
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm planning to

113
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,480
come back from abroad and settle down.

114
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Feel free to visit us

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,920
at home as often as you like.

116
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
You want to settle down here?

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,890
Let me scan your QR code.

118
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
If customers would like to

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
pay with their phones,

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,570
just press here,

121
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
"accept payment with barcode scanner".

122
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,000
Then, ask the customer

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,040
to present their payment code.

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,680
That's it.

125
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Got it.

126
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Practice makes perfect.

127
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Try it yourself.

128
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,200
The customers are done eating.

129
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Go clean the table, please.

130
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,200
OK.

131
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,680
Two cups of latte, please.

132
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,120
OK.

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,160
Latte. One moment, please.

134
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,280
L-latte.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,680
Latte.

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,400
And a sandwich set meal.

137
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,480
OK. A sandwich set meal.

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,210
Please bear with me.

139
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,840
Sandwich set meal.

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,720
72 yuan in total, please.

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,760
You can pay by scanning the code.

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,980
WeChat code scanning.

143
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,080
Why did you take a picture of me?

144
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,200
I wanted to send it to Ling Xiao,

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
and let him know that you've completed your first transaction.

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
Do I look nice in the picture?

147
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,960
My facial expression wasn't good enough.

148
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,020
Add a filter before you send it to him.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,120
Two cups of latte, right?

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,520
Make a sandwich set meal.

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,160
Got it.

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,320
So you've done this only as a hobby, right?

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,780
Yes, I've never systematically learned it.

154
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
But I really like it.

155
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,120
So

156
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
I learned it by watching videos.

157
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
OK, I got it.

158
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,669
You may leave now.

159
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,730
We'll consider it.

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,549
Alright, bye.

161
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
Bye.

162
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,880
She didn't seem to know what she was doing.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,680
No, no, no.

164
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,880
Please keep my CV. I'm back for my bag.

165
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,720
OK, OK, OK.

166
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,480
See you later.

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,240
See you later.

168
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,040
See you later.

169
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
What do you think of her?

170
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,320
Quite cute.

171
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,960
But there is one thing about her that's not ideal.

172
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,640
She can't even polish a bead.

173
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,360
That said,

174
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,120
there's something about her

175
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
that I really like.

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,280
What is it?

177
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,400
She is a girl.

178
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,840
A girl?

179
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,560
What do we need a girl for?

180
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,360
So that you can be distracted from your relationship.

181
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,000
You...

182
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
Stop teasing me.

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,520
I already have Miao now,

184
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,240
don't I?

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
Let me tell you something.

186
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,960
Recently, Miao has been treating me very well.

187
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
He'd stay up late

188
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
to finish all my work.

189
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
He told me

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,400
girls shouldn't stay up late,

191
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,160
especially when

192
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,480
they're over 25 years old.

193
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
Girls must take good care of themselves.

194
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,520
He also said

195
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,600
he'll do everything

196
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,330
that requires staying up late.

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,480
She looked the part.

198
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,480
Not bad.

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
As least she has something to do

200
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
in He Ziqiu's shop.

201
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
But don't forget to remind her

202
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
of her summer holiday homework.

203
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Sorry, it's my fault.

204
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,440
I should have

205
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,880
talked to you in advance.

206
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,400
I thought

207
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
you'd be happy about

208
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
our return.

209
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,520
When will my aunt arrive?

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,780
She arrived in the afternoon,

211
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,880
and helped me with some shopping

212
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,540
as well as sorting things out.

213
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Can I help?

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,720
No, thanks.

215
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
You're very busy at work.

216
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
Just focus on your job.

217
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,320
I know

218
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Chengzi and I

219
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,520
have made things difficult for you.

220
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,040
Can you stop

221
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,200
talking about this?

222
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,240
What do you want me to say?

223
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,520
Nothing.

224
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,400
I just

225
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,280
want to settle down here.

226
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,410
That's fine with me.

227
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
You're always like this.

228
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
Whatever's in your heart,

229
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
just say it.

230
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,840
You didn't tell me

231
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,500
you were coming back, either.

232
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,040
What's more, you lied to me,

233
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,520
saying you came back to see your dad.

234
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,980
But it turned out you had already found a job.

235
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,600
I just don't understand

236
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
why you wouldn't

237
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,840
tell me how you feel.

238
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,720
What are you thinking about right now?

239
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
Just tell me.

240
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,880
I want to marry Jianjian.

241
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
Isn't it too hasty?

242
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,020
Of course, this is your own business.

243
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,740
Whatever you decide to do,

244
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,400
I'll support you.

245
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,480
But I just think that

246
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
at the moment,

247
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,160
you have neither a flat nor a car,

248
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,480
once you're married,

249
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,210
where are you two going to live?

250
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
How about this?

251
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
I'll sell my flat in Singapore

252
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,680
next year,

253
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
and buy you a big flat here.

254
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,820
At least you'll have a place to call home.

255
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,840
I just want to arrange everything

256
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,240
I can for you,

257
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,600
so that your life can be easier.

258
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,120
Dad, what brought you here?

259
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
I called you,

260
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,620
but you didn't answer.

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,730
Are you busy?

262
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,040
Yes.

263
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,000
There's a new intern

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
in our office.

265
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,120
Why didn't you answer my call?

266
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
Was it because mom wouldn't allow you to

267
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,480
or you were not happy for me

268
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,760
to go to Beijing?

269
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,520
Beijing?

270
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,780
Oh, your transfer.

271
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
Didn't mom tell you?

272
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,960
I've been staying in a hotel recently,

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,840
so I haven't met her.

274
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
Why are you staying in a hotel?

275
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,920
Tell me about your transfer

276
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,960
to Beijing.

277
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,720
I'm going to Beijing

278
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,840
because our TV station

279
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,800
has set up an office in Beijing.

280
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,760
My boss needs two people to go with him.

281
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,160
I'll be back in two years.

282
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,090
Dad, what's the matter?

283
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,080
Good.

284
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
Since your mom and I are going to get divorced,

285
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
it's good for you to stay away.

286
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
Otherwise, she may bother you every day,

287
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,840
because she can't bother me anymore.

288
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,920
Divorce?

289
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,300
You two are going to get divorced?

290
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
I can't stand it anymore.

291
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,000
Dad, haven't you decided not to buy a house?

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,960
Why did you two still end up fighting?

293
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280
If it weren't for buying the house,

294
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,680
I would probably accept fate and keep our marriage.

295
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,640
You know

296
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,920
what your mom is like.

297
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,960
She wants to control everything.

298
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,880
Everything has to be done her way.

299
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,880
When you were living at home,

300
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,440
all your mom's attention was drawn to you.

301
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,720
Since you moved out,

302
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,970
she kept finding fault with me.

303
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,040
Everything had to be perfect.

304
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,720
Even the slightest thing would rattle her cage.

305
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
She'd go on and on,

306
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
and stop cooking.

307
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,200
Dad, she's been like that all her life.

308
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,080
But she's not a bad person.

309
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,720
These are all trivial matters.

310
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
I was fine with her taking control over trivial matters.

311
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,240
But you see,

312
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
she even wanted to make a sole decision

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
on such a big thing as buying a house.

314
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,400
I can't stand her anymore.

315
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm already in my 50s.

316
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,160
If I allow her to make rash decisions,

317
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,080
when I retire,

318
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,280
I'll probably be homeless

319
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,880
and have to beg on the street.

320
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,200
Dad, it's not as bad as you think.

321
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,860
You're just blinded by anger.

322
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,360
You've made a life for yourself now.

323
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,160
You can go to Beijing as you want.

324
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
But if I want to live better

325
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,460
for the rest of my life,

326
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
I'll have no choice but to get divorced

327
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,840
and live on my own.

328
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,930
If you were still small,

329
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,210
I wouldn't get divorced for your sake.

330
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,620
Since you're an adult now,

331
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
you don't need me to worry about you.

332
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,760
I believe you'll understand me.

333
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
What does mom think?

334
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
I don't care what she thinks.

335
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,680
I'm determined to get divorced.

336
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,010
I'll be leaving.

337
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,760
Dad.

338
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Speaking of your dad,

339
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,920
there's one thing about him

340
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,200
I really like,

341
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,360
he's always let me have my way.

342
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,880
Excuse me, Vicky.

343
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,760
Can I borrow your phone

344
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,680
for a second?

345
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,520
You left your phone at home?

346
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,320
Thanks.

347
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
Mom, this is Mingyue.

348
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,280
Don't hang up on me.

349
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,600
I met with dad.

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,760
What's going on between you two?

351
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,090
Why did he meet with you?

352
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,360
What did he say to you?

353
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,960
He said...

354
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,680
He said...

355
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,000
He told you he wanted to divorce me, right?

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,520
You two plotted against me,

357
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,920
didn't you?

358
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,600
Ask him to tell me that in person.

359
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,920
I can't believe he's playing the victim.

360
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,380
I'm fine with the divorce.

361
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,840
Ask him to come back for the household register,

362
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,370
and I'll go to the civil affairs bureau with him to get divorced.

363
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,400
Thanks, Vicky.

364
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,000
No problem.

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Thank you.

366
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,080
Why did you come back so early?

367
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,600
I asked for a two-hour leave from work.

368
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
I promised Zhuang Bei's mom

369
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,440
to celebrate his grandmother's birthday.

370
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Last time, I donated

371
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,520
a lot of clothes on a whim.

372
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm really regretting it.

373
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,890
I should have kept some of them.

374
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,910
Do you think this one is too drab?

375
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,880
It's not ideal for a formal occasion, either.

376
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,600
What's the matter with you?

377
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,720
If I insist on going to Beijing,

378
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
do you think I'm too selfish?

379
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,600
No way!

380
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,460
You're hesitating again?

381
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,960
But if your mom

382
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,720
didn't find out your secret,

383
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,440
you wouldn't have

384
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,320
submitted that application on a whim.

385
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,960
It's not too late if you change your mind now.

386
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,490
I don't regret my decision.

387
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,960
I'm just a little worried about my mom.

388
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,840
See?

389
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,800
Your mom always knows

390
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,330
how to make you feel guilty.

391
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,320
It's not like that.

392
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,360
There's a problem between

393
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,090
my mom and dad's relationship.

394
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
My dad wanted a divorce.

395
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,290
That's impossible.

396
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,520
How can your dad

397
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,780
live without your mom?

398
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,560
Your dad hasn't even

399
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,820
washed his socks once.

400
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
They must be working together

401
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,160
to fool you.

402
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,080
Don't fall for their trap.

403
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,760
But my dad...

404
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,600
OK, OK, sweetie,

405
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,360
stop there.

406
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,320
I must find

407
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,440
a dress now.

408
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,560
Zhuang Bei and his mom

409
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,890
will be here any minute.

410
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,400
Fine.

411
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
I'll leave you alone.

412
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,080
Can.

413
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
Madam.

414
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,200
You look gorgeous.

415
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,720
Why did you drive the car

416
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,800
to the neighborhood?

417
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,720
It's very hot today,

418
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
in this way, you don't have to walk under the sun.

419
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,240
Come on, get in the car.

420
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,080
Thanks.

421
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,420
Bei, open the door.

422
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
Can, I miss you so much.

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,640
You, too.

424
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,520
Bei said that you asked some time off work

425
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
to help me here.

426
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,880
Thank you so much.

427
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
Madam, you invited me for a free meal,

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,060
I should thank you.

429
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,200
I'd be very glad to join you

430
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
for free meals in the future.

431
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,880
Great.

432
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,760
Bei, let's go.

433
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,600
Got it.

434
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,520
Since you're working in the museum,

435
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,640
you won't be able to do your actress job.

436
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,080
I've quit being an actress.

437
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,040
Now that I work in the museum,

438
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
my parents can stop worrying about me.

439
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,940
But being an actress is your dream, isn't it?

440
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,810
But I have to make a living, too.

441
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,400
I couldn't even get through auditions,

442
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
which really said something about my acting skills.

443
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,640
I was just over confident.

444
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
You're just being humble.

445
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,880
To be honest,

446
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
I asked Bei

447
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,800
to find out all your TV series

448
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,920
and watched them.

449
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,120
You did great.

450
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,210
Didn't she, Bei?

451
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,520
He's just being polite.

452
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,320
I did watch them.

453
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,450
You watched all of them?

454
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,600
My mom wanted to watch them,

455
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,060
so I watched them with mom.

456
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
I knew it.

457
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,600
By the way, I searched for your info online,

458
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,320
and found that when you were 19,

459
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
you starred in a TV series

460
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,080
called

461
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,140
Legend of the Moon.

462
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,040
The producers and directors were all very famous.

463
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,640
How come it never aired on TV?

464
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,810
That's the way it is.

465
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,720
Luck can also be very important

466
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,160
for an actress.

467
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
What a shame!

468
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,160
I didn't know

469
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,360
it's possible that a TV series never

470
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
get aired after it's been produced.

471
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
It was probably

472
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
my fate.

473
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
It doesn't matter.

474
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
I feel quite happy working

475
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
in the museum now.

476
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,300
What are you doing?

477
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I'm looking for the remote control.

478
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,240
Have the girls come back yet?

479
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,520
Not yet.

480
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,000
When are you

481
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,730
going back to your mom's place?

482
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,880
If you're not happy for me to stay in your room,

483
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,800
I can sleep on the sofa in Ziqiu's flat.

484
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,600
Forget it.

485
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,960
If you sleep on Ziqiu's sofa,

486
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,320
you're going to be a pain for him.

487
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,050
You'd better stay with us here.

488
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,960
Let me ask you something.

489
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,050
Go ahead.

490
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Have you slept

491
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,540
with my older brother?

492
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,360
Yes.

493
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,000
We've slept together since we were little.

494
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,000
Childish.

495
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,400
You nosy lass.

496
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,440
Whoever asked such a question is the childish one.

497
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,920
Don't be ungrateful.

498
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,340
I asked this question for your interest.

499
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,520
Really?

500
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Tell me why.

501
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,640
From my perspective,

502
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,440
you and my older brother's relationship is not going to last long.

503
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,680
So don't ever sleep together.

504
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,480
If you do,

505
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,560
it'll be awkward when you bump into each other after you split up.

506
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,280
My mom will never

507
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,200
ever approve of

508
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
your relationship.

509
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,520
Fine.

510
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,200
Ask your mom to give me 5 million,

511
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,860
then I'll leave her son alone.

512
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,570
I'm not joking with you.

513
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,480
When my older brother graduated from university,

514
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
and intended to come back,

515
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
my mom insisted on him staying abroad.

516
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,130
Did you know why?

517
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,160
Your mom wanted to keep your older brother by her side,

518
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,420
it's understandable.

519
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,480
My dad had gone,

520
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,280
my older brother had graduated,

521
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,010
and all my uncles were in China.

522
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,480
Why would my mom insist on living abroad?

523
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
If my older brother wanted to come back,

524
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,640
my mom might as well

525
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,720
come back with him.

526
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
Why would she insist on living abroad herself

527
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,240
and prevent my older brother from coming back as well?

528
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,100
Have you ever thought about that?

529
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
It's because my mom

530
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,680
didn't want my older brother to see you guys.

531
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,280
She hated to

532
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,540
see you guys even more.

533
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
You, your dad,

534
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,140
and my older brother's dad

535
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
are the people my mom hates the most.

536
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,800
My older brother will never

537
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,360
win in the fight against mom.

538
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,400
He never won,

539
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,720
and will never win in the future.

540
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,170
I can't win, either,

541
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,660
simply because she's our mom.

542
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,900
I'm going to take a shower now.

543
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,280
Braised beef noodles and seafood noodles.

544
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,040
Ms. Zhu,

545
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,440
where's Haichao?

546
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,320
He went food shopping.

547
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,520
He said there'll be a guest here in noon.

548
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,040
Hongying, you see?

549
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,920
Haichao is

550
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,180
such a hospitable guy.

551
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,360
Knowing there'll be a guest at home,

552
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,160
he began working since early morning.

553
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,960
If you marry him,

554
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,400
he'll cook you different dishes

555
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
every day.

556
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,400
You'll be treated like a queen.

557
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,520
Mrs. Qian,

558
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,640
I shouldn't count my chickens before they hatch.

559
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
Haichao

560
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,840
isn't into me at all.

561
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,440
You can't fool me.

562
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
If he didn't like you, he wouldn't have taught you how to cook.

563
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,120
That doesn't count.

564
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,760
In my opinion,

565
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,080
he'll teach anyone who's willing to learn from him.

566
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,760
That's impossible.

567
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,250
I've never seen him teach anyone else.

568
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,840
Welcome.

569
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,280
Mrs. He, Mr. Li went food shopping.

570
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,600
I know. He told me.

571
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,240
Have a seat. Would you like a bowl of noodles?

572
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,320
No, thanks.

573
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,520
He Mei.

574
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,720
Mrs. Qian.

575
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,400
I didn't expect you'd recognize me.

576
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
Come and sit here.

577
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,740
Come over here.

578
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,040
Come.

579
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,610
Take a seat here.

580
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,880
He Mei,

581
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,560
where have you been

582
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,040
these years?

583
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,880
I didn't do much.

584
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,040
What's the point of

585
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,080
going to all those different places?

586
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,880
See? You're back here in the end.

587
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,360
Haichao is really a good guy.

588
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,730
He never blamed you.

589
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,280
Mrs. Qian, who is this?

590
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
This is Ziqiu's mom.

591
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,770
She's indeed as pretty as people said.

592
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,240
He Mei,

593
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
you haven't changed much

594
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,200
over the years.

595
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,060
You're still as pretty as before.

596
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,520
You're here already?

597
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
I haven't kept you waiting for long, have I?

598
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,400
No, I just came.

599
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,360
Good.

600
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,640
Mrs. Qian and Ms. Zhang,

601
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,770
you're here as well?

602
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,440
What's going on between you two?

603
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
He Mei wanted to learn

604
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
one of Ziqiu's favorite dishes.

605
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,160
So I decided to teach her.

606
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Now I know

607
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,720
why you said you and I are not suitable for each other.

608
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,560
Nonsense!

609
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,560
Who said you two aren't great together?

610
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,960
Haichao said it.

611
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,280
It turns out

612
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,920
men indeed care about a woman's appearance.

613
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,080
No, no, no, this has

614
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,120
nothing to do with the appearance.

615
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,600
He Mei and I

616
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,120
meet each other mainly for the sake

617
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
of our son.

618
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,320
You two split up?

619
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,460
We weren't meant to be.

620
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,240
Since you two split up,

621
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,400
why has neither of you

622
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
told me?

623
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,160
Do you really see me

624
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,290
as your matchmaker?

625
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,480
Well, Mrs. Qian,

626
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
don't be mad.

627
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,640
Actually,

628
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
I'm to blame.

629
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,260
I thought I'd be able to get back with him.

630
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,820
Since you have somebody in your mind,

631
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,560
why didn't you tell me?

632
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,040
I'm not going to prevent you from

633
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,840
looking for your true love, am I?

634
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,960
Besides,

635
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,000
among all the men

636
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,880
I was introduced to,

637
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,760
you are far from the best.

638
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,320
I just thought you are kind, and that's what I like about you.

639
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
But it turns out

640
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,080
you're also shallow and like pretty women.

641
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,600
He's indeed very kind.

642
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,840
That's why

643
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,880
he didn't want to make it clear to you

644
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,000
that he didn't like you very much,

645
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
because he didn't want to hurt you.

646
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,240
You...

647
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,520
You like his kindness.

648
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,800
He likes my look.

649
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,640
Actually, that's the way it is.

650
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,280
Everyone's looking for something in their other half.

651
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,000
No one is better than the other.

652
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,060
Don't you think so?

653
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,880
I...

654
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,000
Shall we leave now?

655
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,920
Of course.

656
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,120
Let me help you with this.

657
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,050
It's very heavy.

658
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,680
Well,

659
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,680
take your time.

660
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,960
We got to go.

661
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,920
See you later, Mrs. Qian.

662
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,560
Bye.

663
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,760
After you.

664
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,480
Thanks.

665
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,240
Who does she think

666
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,320
she is?

667
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,600
Li Haichao, I didn't realize you're this kind of person.

668
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
You just fell for her beauty.

669
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,000
Sooner or later, you're going to pay for it.

670
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,200
Mrs. Qian,

671
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,880
don't just

672
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
eat your noodles,

673
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
say something.

674
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,800
Don't ask me.

675
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,820
I don't read people very well.

676
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,500
Walk on the other side.

677
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,170
There are too many cars.

678
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,160
What happened between

679
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,420
you and that Ms. Zhang?

680
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,080
She's the one

681
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,800
Mrs. Qian match-made me with.

682
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,370
She's a nice person,

683
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,170
but we're not suitable for each other.

684
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,000
Have you never met anyone

685
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,520
suitable in so many years?

686
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,500
During the first several years, as our son was young, I didn't want to go on dates.

687
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,680
Recently, Jianjian

688
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,040
kept asking Mrs. Qian

689
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,970
to find me women to go on dates with.

690
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,440
She just

691
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,700
wanted me to have company.

692
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,720
Li Jianjian is really a good kid.

693
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,100
She also hopes that you and Ziqiu can make peace.

694
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,200
She does.

695
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,200
When she heard that you wanted Ziqiu's pictures,

696
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,360
she immediately went to develop them

697
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,760
and sent them through post

698
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,160
real fast.

699
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
I remember

700
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,320
when she was little,

701
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,640
she really hated me.

702
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,740
She even called me a witch.

703
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,480
It's not that she disliked you.

704
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,560
She just didn't want you

705
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,040
to be her stepmother.

706
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Would she be fine

707
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,800
with it if I became

708
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,250
her stepmother now?

709
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,040
Of course.

710
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Mind the steps.

711
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,930
They're very slippery.

712
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,880
Take your time.

713
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,760
Morning, boss.

714
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,120
Morning?

715
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,600
It's almost 11 a.m.

716
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,480
Juan, come with me.

717
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,640

It's just Yufei's exclusive interview.

Wow, Yufei's exclusive interview.

Come on, read this section.

730

Although "Two Boys and A Girl"

731
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,320
and "The Three of Us" are similar in design,

732
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,520
Jianjian's work

733
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
is heavily influenced by mine.

734
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,320
There's some level of imitation,

735
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,520
but I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.

736
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
What does he mean?

737
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,120
He's obviously saying

738
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,760
"Two Boys and A Girl"

739
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
is a copy of his work.

740
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,320
Yufei's "The Three of Us"

741
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,000
debuted 4 months earlier than

742

"Two Boys and A Girl".

743
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,960
What do you mean?

744
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,640
What's the point of shouting at me?

745
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,600
When deciding who copies whom,

746
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,000
only debut time is considered.

747
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,240
Do you think people will believe the one which debuted earlier

748
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,720
was a copy of the one that debuted later?

749
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,920
The design was inspired by

750
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,720
a photo of Jianjian，

751
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,640
Ling Xiao and Ziqiu,

752
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,320
OK?

753
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,440
Do you have evidence?

754
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,840
I'm going to call him.

755
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,180
He's not answering it, right?

756
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,920
How about you call

757
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,760

758
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,120
Forget it.

759
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,440
I don't want him to get involved

760
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,840
in such a negative thing.

761
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,200
Sounds right.

762
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,760
Don't be upset.

763
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,650
At worst, you'll lose a friend.

764

We can publish an article on a university newspaper

773

Are you sure?

774
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,480
Yes.

There's a coffee shop near the neighborhood.

That's what neighbors are for.

Yes. We do look after one another.

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,840
after you move in here,

859
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
if you need anything,

860
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,760
feel free to

861
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,420
let me know.

862
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
Thank you.

863
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,140
No problem.

864
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,210
Have some watermelon, please.

865
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't like watermelon.

866
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,800
If you're busy,

867
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,130
just feel free to leave.

868
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,760
You don't have to take care of us.

869
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,840
What would you like to eat?

870
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,800
I'll get them for you.

871
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
No, thanks.

872
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,880
You probably didn't know, my son Ling Xiao

873
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
used to be left with

874
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,160
the neighbors by Heping.

875
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,360
He'd eat and sleep in the neighbors',

876
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,160
and the neighbors would get money every month

877
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,420
for taking care of him.

878
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
As a result, he built great relationships with the neighbors,

879
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,080
and even became like their family member.

880
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,920
Li Jianjian's family

881
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,380
made a lot of money from it.

882
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,680
Yes.

883
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,360
So you can rest assured that

884
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,640
Ling Xiao and I will be great together.

885
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,440
I'll definitely take good care of him.

886
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,640
Are you and Ling Xiao in a relationship?

887
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,840
Yes, we are.

888
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,320
But Ling Xiao hasn't been back for long.

889
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,120
Did you start the relationship

890
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,360
before he came back?

891
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,320
No, no, no.

892
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,200
We started seeing each other

893
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,530
only after he came back.

894
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
I liked him when I was little.

895
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,120
Actually, Ling Xiao

896
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
liked you as well.

897
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,760
I remember during summer holidays,

898
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,480
he'd come to our place to visit his grandmother,

899
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,440
but he never stayed more than one night.

900
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,360
He'd

901
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,040
call your name

902
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,880
all the time,

903
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,120
and save all the goodies

904
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,400
for you.

905
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,240
Jianjian,

906
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,570
I don't want to waste too much of your time.

907
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,520
OK, OK.

908
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,720
If you need any help,

909
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,050
feel free to let me know.

910
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,080
OK.

911
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,810
What were you doing?

912
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Nothing.

913
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,040
I just didn't want to bother her.

914
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,000
Ling Xiao, what brought you back?

915
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,420
They're in my flat?

916
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,210
Stay here, don't come over.

917
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,640
Why are you back?

918
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,080
You haven't seen your aunt

919
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,610
for quite a years, have you?

920
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,880
Last time you met was 4 years ago

921
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,960
when you visited us

922
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
in Singapore, right?

923
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,800
Exactly.

924
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,680
What did you say to Jianjian?

925
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,220
I'm asking you what you said to Jianjian.

926
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,040
I didn't say anything.

927
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,960
What did she tell you?

928
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,080
She didn't say anything.

929
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
But I have eyes!

930
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,600
Ling Xiao,

931
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,320
you shouldn't talk to your mom with that attitude.

932
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,520
Whatever you want to say, say it nicely.

933
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,440
You can do whatever you want

934
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,920
with Chengzi and me,

935
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,930
because you're our mom.

936
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,160
But you can't insult Jianjian.

937
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,440
Not a single word!

938
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,680
Damn it.

939
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,200
Ling Xiao.

940
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,660
It's a misunderstanding.

941
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,860
It's a misunderstanding.

942
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,720
Li Jianjian,

943
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,200
what did you say to Ling Xiao?

944
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,560
Tell me right now.

945
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,970
Did I do anything to you?

946
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,440
No, your mom didn't do anything to me.

947
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,240
I was upset with something else.

948
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,570
I know you don't like me.

949
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,600
But please stop

950
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,320
stirring things up

951
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,120
between me and my son.

952
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,380
Stop making things up.

953
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,080
I know you don't like her.

954
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,600
She's made you tea

955
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,520
and prepared fruit for you.

956
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,850
I saw her crying at home.

957
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,480
Can you say it has nothing to do with you?

958
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,240
Ling Xiao,

959
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
that's what your mom is like.

960
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,200
Although her words may be a bit harsh,

961
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,330
she doesn't hold grudges in her heart.

962
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,760
I don't care how she feels

963
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,440
in her heart.

964
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,200
I don't want to know.

965
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,780
But I know what you think deep down in your heart!

966
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,240
I know you hate me.

967
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,440
I know nothing I do is right.

968
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,600
You just want me to stay away from you

969
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,880
as far as possible.

970
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Why have I never seen you speak for

971
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,800
your younger sister like this?

972
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,440
If you ever

973
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,560
treated your younger sister

974
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,160
like you treat Li Jianjian even half,

975
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,080
she wouldn't

976
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
have been

977
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,680
so rebellious.

978
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,440
Fine. It's all my fault.

979
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,760
You're happy?

980
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,330
It's not your fault.

981
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
It's all my fault.

982
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,360
There's nothing wrong with you for hating your own mom.

983
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,400
You only care about

984
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,560
your dad

985
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,880
and your neighbors.

986
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,680
Because they care about me, too.

987
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,900
Why have you never cared about me?

988
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,040
Aunt,

989
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,800
sorry to

990
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,600
get you involved

991
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,330
in our fight.

992
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,540
Thanks for coming to help.

993
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,320
No problem, it's my pleasure.

994
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,000
Don't be mad with your mom.

995
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm really sorry.

996
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,760
Ling Xiao!
