00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 17

4
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,560
Are you moving back to Mr. Ling's place?

5
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,240
No.

6
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,940
Then are you going back to Singapore?

7
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,720
Haven't you already

8
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,380
joined the hospital's staff?

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
How can you be so self-willed?

10
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,960
You are already back here.

11
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Just because of our conflict,

12
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,890
you are leaving?

13
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,720
You must follow your heart!

14
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,600
Don't take impulsive actions

15
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
because of others.

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,460
Can you do that?

17
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
I see.

18
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,290
You just don't understand, do you?

19
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Why the hell are you messing around?

20
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,810
I'm not messing around.

21
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,680
This is not fun.

22
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
As a man near his 30s,

23
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,690
can you act like a grown-up?

24
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,840
You had a temper during the day

25
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
and refused to check my teeth. It's OK!

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Then suddenly you are going back

27
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
to Singapore,

28
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,640
quitting your job without hesitation.

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,900
Do you have any sense of responsibility?

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Fine, fine, fine! It was my fault!

31
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
I was too impulsive that day.

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,480
I lost my mind,

33
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,000
saying you guys were not my brothers.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,560
I should reflect on myself.

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I should never say anything like that.

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,240
I apologize.

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Sorry.

38
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
You guys are my brothers, all right?

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm not your brother.

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
It was good

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,920
to have

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,079
you guys back.

43
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,280
I was very happy, too.

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,240
But indeed, we can't get along with each other

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,900
like we did when we were young.

46
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,280
And you guys

47
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,520
always think you owe me something.

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,120
This makes me feel stressed.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,320
Can you just

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
give me some time to accept the fact?

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,420
The last tenant left the suitcase

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
as well as some junk

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,160
in the balcony cabinet.

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
I have to throw them away.

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,160
So you are not leaving?

56
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
Why didn't you say that earlier?

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
You didn't ask me.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,600
Li Jianjian! Ling Xiao!

59
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,080
Mingyue!

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,380
What happened?

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
Did you go to the supermarket?

62
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,640
Come on. Let me carry it for you.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,770
I'll go back and leave you guys to talk.

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,120
Did you have a quarrel?

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,320
No.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,810
We were having a heart-to-heart talk.

67
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,920
Then you two are good now?

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,280
I was thinking about creating

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
some opportunities for you to make peace.

70
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
Thank you.

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,600
Ling Xiao,

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,840
I bought lots of vegetables,

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,280
meat rolls and meatballs.

74
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,680
Let's have hot pot together on the weekend.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,440
OK.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Let's go.

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,820
Hello, Zhuang Bei.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,360
What's up?

79
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
You scared me to death!

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,280
Ziqiu,

81
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,360
I found the car

82
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,240
your mom was riding

83
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
last time.

84
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,700
It's a special car.

85
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,040
Special car?

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,480
I told the driver

87
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
about your story.

88
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
He checked itinerary receipts

89
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,640
and said he picked up you mom at Huaxing Road

90
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
and drove her to Blue Sea International Trade Center.

91
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,600
Ziqiu,

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
now that you know your mom is in the city,

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
you can go to Ling Xiao's father.

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,560
It may be easier

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,960
for cops to find a person.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Ziqiu,

97
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
do you hear me, Ziqiu?

98
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,240
Listen, I must go.

99
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
What happened?

100
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Nothing. Zhuang Bei asked me to dinner.

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll take a shower.

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Welcome. How many guests do we have?

103
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
He's there.

104
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
Can, come here! Here!

105
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,720
Dad.

106
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
The food is well done.

107
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,240
You just come in time. Have some.

108
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,690
Why are you working so late?

109
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,970
Do you always have dinner at this hour?

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Not always. It depends.

111
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
If I don’t need to eat I won’t.

112
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
You live alone yourself.

113
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
It worries me most

114
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
that you don't eat well.

115
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,920
Here, dip it in the sauce.

116
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,680
It's tasty.

117
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,840
No.

118
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,280
Can, you look slimmer.

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,240
You don't have to lose weight

120
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
like other girls.

121
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,100
Health is more important.

122
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,000
Weren't you guys who thought I was chubby?

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,030
From my second year in junior high school,

124
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,909
my dinner

125
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,030
had nothing but boiled shrimps and vegetables.

126
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,600
It...

127
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
It was my fault. It was my fault.

128
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
Come on, eat more now.

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
Come on.

130
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,100
What's the matter?

131
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,240
You didn't receive the WeChat transfer.

132
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
Here, take it.

133
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
You live alone.

134
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,180
It's better to have enough money.

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,200
No, I have money.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,520
Your income is unstable.

137
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
Now the situation of our family finance is getting better.

138
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,240
Do you have to

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,700
work so hard to make money?

140
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,960
I think

141
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,720
you should get

142
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,040
a stable job.

143
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,760
If you are here to educate me,

144
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
Just stop it.

145
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
Last time,

146
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,720
I made it very clear to my mom.

147
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,280
Don't hold grudge against your mom.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,460
You've been away from home

149
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
for three months

150
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,640
without even making a phone call.

151
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Does it have to be like this?

152
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,480
Didn't she say

153
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,960
that I shouldn't come back home

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,120
if I weren't to listen to her

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,280
and find a job?

156
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,200
This is...

157
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
You...

158
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,960
Your mom just hopes you to live well.

159
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,560
She hopes me to make more money.

160
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,000
Isn't she always complaining at home?

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
If I knew it would be like this,

162
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,880
I should let you make more commercials

163
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,520
to earn more money and buy more properties

164
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,480
while you still had the ability.

165
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,300
Your mom...

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,080
Sometimes, your mom

167
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
has a sharp tongue.

168
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,050
And she told my grandma that I was lazy.

169
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,900
Ever since I can remember,

170
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
I've been working hard

171
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,880
to shoot movies and commercials

172
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,360
to make money,

173
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,420
while other kids were studying hard.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
After I reached puberty,

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,160
I had to drink

176
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
a large glass of lemonade every day

177
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
before going to bed.

178
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
Why?

179
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Because I was hungry.

180
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
I was too hungry to sleep!

181
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Previously, she took me with her

182
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
wherever she went.

183
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,960
What about now?

184
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,560
When others ask her about my job,

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,000
she's too embarrassed to answer them,

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,800
because she feels ashamed of me!

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
I just don't understand.

188
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
I've worked hard by myself

189
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,560
from the very beginning to this day.

190
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,280
I have nothing to be ashamed of!

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,000
This is...

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,280
Have more. Dip it in the sauce.

193
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,440
All right, Dad.

194
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,700
Drive safely on your way home.

195
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,480
Can,

196
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
your mom's birthday is in a few days.

197
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,610
It's her 50th birthday.

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,000
According to the customs of our hometown,

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,730
we should celebrate it for her.

200
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,600
With relatives and friends there,

201
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,080
she'll feel more embarrassed

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
if I join you.

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,680
Can, she's your mother.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,520
I see. I'll be there.

205
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,040
Besides,

206
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,800
weight management isn't the reason

207
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,260
why I didn't eat the sauce.

208
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,730
The reason is I'm allergic to satay sauce.

209
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
You forgot it.

210
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,380
You get up so early.

211
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,160
Then let's have breakfast.

212
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
You see, today,

213
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
I cooked so much food and brought it back.

214
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
Am I smart?

215
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
Give me some praises.

216
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,760
Why were you cooking

217
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,720
like thieving?

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
I have it hard every day.

219
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,760
My business has just opened.

220
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
I get my hands full every morning in the shop.

221
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160
And I have to sneak in and cook breakfast like a thief.

222
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm nearly

223
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,760
worn out.

224
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,240
By the way,

225
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,200
you've got

226
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
vitamin tablets, right?

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,860
Give me some to build up my health.

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,180
Buy them yourself.

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
I buy you food and drink every day.

230
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,580
How could you be so stingy?

231
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,650
Do you remember that

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,320
I gave you half the money

233
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,240
for grocery?

234
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,400
Brothers shouldn't square accounts in every detail.

235
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,000
You miser!

236
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
Have some soup, here.

237
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,840
Hello.

238
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,120
What's up?

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
Take it easy. Take it easy.

240
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,880
Which hospital?

241
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,680
OK.

242
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
OK. I'll be there soon.

243
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,120
Sir, excuse me. Stop the bus, please.

244
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,280
I can't. We're not at the stop.

245
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,760
It's an emergency. Do me a favor, please.

246
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
I can't stop on the overpass.

247
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,370
Tang Can, are you still at home?

248
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,200
Forget the toilet!

249
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,560
Go to my room right now.

250
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,720
Open the door and turn left

251
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,640
to the second drawer.

252
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,600
Grab my bank card

253
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,260
and go to Changgeng Hospital.

254
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,160
Ziqiu had an accident.

255
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,640
My dad said he was hit seriously.

256
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,000
Right now,

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
I'm farther and farther away

258
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,660
from Changgeng Hospital.

259
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Changgeng Hospital.

260
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
That's right, Changgeng Hospital.

261
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,840
OK, OK, OK.

262
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,000
Sir, how much longer does it take?

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Why the overpass is so long?

264
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Take it easy, young lady.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,130
We're almost there.

266
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Sorry, sorry.

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
You have no manners!

268
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,320
Sir, let's go!

269
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
Hurry up!

270
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,000
How is it?

271
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,160
Where is Ziqiu?

272
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,400
Tell me!

273
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,560
When he was brought here,

274
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
he had blood all over his face.

275
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
The doctor said they had done their best.

276
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,600
Jianjian!

277
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Li Jianjian!

278
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm kidding, Li Jianjian!

279
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,600
Ziqiu is fine, Li Jianjian!

280
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,960
Don't cry.

281
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,800
Ziqiu.

282
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,160
Ziqiu is fine!

283
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,000
Ziqiu!

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,680
Li Jianjian, I'm kidding!

285
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,040
What happened?

286
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,360
Ziqiu.

287
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,600
I joked with her, saying that He Ziqiu...

288
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,040
Ziqiu.

289
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,880
Jianjian, Ziqiu is fine.

290
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,640
Jianjian,

291
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,900
Ziqiu just passed out.

292
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,840
Jianjian!

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,440
Ziqiu is fine. He's not dead.

294
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Jianjian!

295
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
He's not dead?

296
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,240
No, he isn't.

297
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,880
Then Tang Can...

298
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,280
Tang Can talked rubbish.

299
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,160
I...

300
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,200
I was just kidding you.

301
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,400
You...

302
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,760
Jianjian, he's really fine.

303
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,069
You see, everything is normal.

304
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,160
Do you know the proper way to talk?

305
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,560
How could you

306
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,680
kid about this?

307
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,560
How could he ride a bike

308
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,280
after taking such a large dose of Valium?

309
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,000
You were lucky to hit the tree

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and got a minor concussion.

311
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,160
If you had hit a car,

312
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,480
you should have died.

313
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,560
Take some rest

314
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,760
and stay in the hospital for two days for observation.

315
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,640
Don't move.

316
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Thank you.

317
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,320
You are welcome.

318
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
If the patient vomits up,

319
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
remember to notify the doctor.

320
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,960
Sure, I'll ring the bell.

321
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,600
Thank you.

322
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,760
Why did you take the Valium?

323
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
I didn't take any Valium.

324
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,920
Then what did you take?

325
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,960
Just now, the nurse said

326
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,840
they found lots of Valium

327
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
in your blood.

328
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,080
Think it over.

329
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,860
What are the pills?

330
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,480
Vitamin A and B and Carotene,

331
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,740
for daily health care.

332
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,570
He really gets all varieties of pills.

333
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,450
Take two pills of each kind.

334
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,170
More supplements are definitely better.

335
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,500
No wonder he refused to give me the pills.

336
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,320
He always stays up at night.

337
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
I thought he was reading novels.

338
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,530
It turns out he couldn't sleep.

339
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,520
Mr. Ling.

340
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,140
We are leaving, Ziqiu.

341
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,440
Ling Xiao, stay here with him.

342
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,440
If he throws up,

343
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
call the doctor immediately.

344
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,280
All right.

345
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,360
I'll go back home to cook some food

346
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
and bring it over here later.

347
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,960
OK.

348
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,080
How about you? Are you going back to the police station?

349
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
I have to get back to work.

350
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,330
I want to have a word with Ling Xiao.

351
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,650
OK. Then I go back home to cook the meal.

352
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,960
Son, you don't want to sleep

353
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
or you just can't sleep?

354
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,240
I can sleep, but not for long.

355
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,050
I take a nap when I have time during the day.

356
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,760
Why didn't you tell me?

357
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
Every time I called to ask your situation,

358
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
you just said you were fine

359
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,120
and everything was fine.

360
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,850
Is everything fine in this way?

361
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
I didn't want you to worry about me.

362
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm more worried about you now.

363
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,200
Besides,

364
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,460
your mother called me yesterday.

365
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,160
She said you told her

366
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,920
that you came back this time to visit me.

367
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,000
Is it true?

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,520
You've started work now.

369
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Can you really fool her in this matter?

370
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,160
She won't agree.

371
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,800
Even if she won't agree,

372
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,330
you must tell her the truth.

373
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,960
How long can you fool her?

374
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,200
Fine, I'll make a phone call

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,120
to have a talk with her.

376
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,840
You went to university in Singapore

377
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,120
because you had to take care of her.

378
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,080
I had no other option, so I agreed.

379
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,880
Besides,

380
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
I still have your guardianship.

381
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
Dad, I'm an adult now.

382
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,420
You lost my guardianship a long time ago.

383
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,080
You know my mom's temper.

384
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,760
Whatever you say will be in vain.

385
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,000
Let me talk to her.

386
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,240
I can't escape from this.

387
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,780
You talk to her.

388
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,170
You are an adult now.

389
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
It's best to do it yourself.

390
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,690
You must talk to her in a proper way.

391
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,860
Don't piss her off.

392
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,180
Well, son, I have something to discuss with you.

393
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,240
Son, no matter what happens in the future,

394
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,880
good or bad,

395
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
can you just tell your father?

396
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,560
You've grown up now

397
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,840
and I can't help you much.

398
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,360
But, I should know

399
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,640
what you've been suffering from.

400
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,120
All right?

401
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,640
OK, just go back.

402
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,000
I have work to do.

403
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,520
Go back.

404
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,460
Why are you crying?

405
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,120
No.

406
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,680
Dad told me.

407
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,800
You thought I was dead

408
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,940
and cried like hell in the corridor outside.

409
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
I just felt

410
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,000
if you were dead,

411
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,730
I should cry aloud. That's the proper thing to do.

412
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,920
The accident is really worthwhile.

413
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,840
How can you say things like that?

414
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,520
Don't pinch my nose! Don't do that!

415
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,680
You are crazy.

416
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,640
What's wrong with Ling Xiao?

417
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,800
How do I know?

418
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,120
You two live together.

419
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,380
How could you not know?

420
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,280
He doesn't

421
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,410
tell me everything.

422
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,480
If you don't tell anything to others,

423
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,200
you get mental problems easily.

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
So you know that.

425
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,800
When we were young,

426
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,360
he told a lot of things to you, didn't he?

427
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,080
But now,

428
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
you just don't want to listen to him.

429
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,440
Li Jianjian wants to know

430
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,720
why you can't sleep

431
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,080
at such a young age.

432
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,160
You also want to know, don't you?

433
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,290
My nose! Nose! Nose!

434
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,090
Cut it out! His wound may crack!

435
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,420
It's not a big deal.

436
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,240
Just a sleep disorder.

437
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I asked the doctor

438
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,360
and he said

439
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,420
it occurred a lot among young people.

440
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,440
And you,

441
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,360
you get older, but not cleverer,

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,720
taking pills at will without even knowing what they are.

443
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,380
Now you are blaming me, right?

444
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
If you had put those pills in their bottles,

445
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,760
who would have taken them?

446
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Why did you

447
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,120
put the Valium

448
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,520
in a bottle for vitamins?

449
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,440
At first,

450
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,520
I didn't want

451
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,000
Chengzi and my mom know about it.

452
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Why?

453
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,560
Because in my family,

454
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,640
I'm the one who can't afford to get sick.

455
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,160
Thank you.

456
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,360
Your fruit tea.

457
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,320
Not coffee?

458
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
Drinking coffee during the day to refresh yourself

459
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,400
and taking sleeping pills at night to sleep,

460
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,880
this is a vicious circle.

461
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,740
You have to stop drinking coffee.

462
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,040
Our Jianjian

463
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,040
is as caring as she was

464
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
in her childhood.

465
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,480
And she's more experienced now,

466
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,410
like a grown-up.

467
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Of course.

468
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I can deal with business myself now.

469
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,000
My small studio

470
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,840
couldn't earn me much money right now,

471
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,040
but I like the job.

472
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,280
As long as I work hard,

473
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
there is no problem supporting the family.

474
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,120
In the future, I'll be able to

475
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,720
take care of my dad and yours.

476
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,580
Look at you. So proud of yourself.

477
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,640
Don't touch my head.

478
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,360
I'm not a kid anymore.

479
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,760
In my eyes,

480
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,880
you are always

481
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
the little girl

482
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,760
who bent over to draw

483
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,640
in front of the noodles restaurant.

484
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,920
You just looked smart.

485
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,520
But in fact,

486
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,240
a stranger could take you home

487
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,320
with some fried pork chops.

488
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,920
You idiot!

489
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,640
How about you?

490
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,280
You almost went with a stranger

491
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,880
because of a small sugar figurine.

492
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't say this!

493
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,220
I've already forgotten it and you are bringing it up again!

494
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,000
Is Singapore fun?

495
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
I haven't been there before.

496
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,880
I didn't have much fun there,

497
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,410
because I was busy studying

498
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,780
and taking care of my mom and Chengzi.

499
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,880
Every day,

500
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,800
I went back and forth among several places.

501
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
After I began to work,

502
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,520
I was in no fit state to entertain myself.

503
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,320
I was very busy after graduation.

504
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,880
Later, we had less contact with each other.

505
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,920
So I know little

506
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,850
about your life.

507
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,520
Tell me when you are free.

508
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,850
What do you want to know?

509
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,560
Do you have a girlfriend?

510
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,120
No.

511
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,440
Seriously?

512
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,200
It's true.

513
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,810
But I like a girl.

514
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,970
What does she look like? Is she pretty?

515
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,000
Very pretty.

516
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
And very cute.

517
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,720
I haven't seen her anyway.

518
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,380
You can say whatever you like.

519
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,450
Is she your schoolmate?

520
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,680
You have nothing else to ask?

521
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
How did you get burned there?

522
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,540
I cooked some porridge

523
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,960
and failed to hold the bowl firmly. It knocked over.

524
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,640
The whole bowl

525
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
fell on my shoulder by accident.

526
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
But I didn't feel burned at that moment,

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,160
so I cleaned up the pieces of the bowl first.

528
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
Later, when I went to the bathroom

529
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,560
to take a shower,

530
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,010
I finally found that my skin had stuck to the clothes.

531
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,360
I can imagine the pain.

532
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt anymore.

533
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,940
I said don't touch my head!

534
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,160
Don't you know there are three bunches of fire

535
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,040
on a kid's head?

536
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,520
Oh, dear!

537
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,170
How did you end up like this?

538
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,890
What happened to your hand?

539
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,680
Just a scratch.

540
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,010
It can't touch the water for several days.

541
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,320
The flowers are from Tang Can.

542
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,120
She wishes you a quick recovery.

543
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
Why doesn't she come by herself?

544
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,620
She doesn't have the nerves to meet you guys.

545
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,960
Come on, don't be mad with her.

546
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,320
I criticized her.

547
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,320
She's a drama queen

548
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,720
who's ready to act at anytime and anywhere.

549
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm really not mad with her.

550
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,220
I have to thank her.

551
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
Without this incident,

552
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,760
I still thought Li Jianjian

553
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
really hated me.

554
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,360
What's the logic?

555
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,920
Is your brain hurt?

556
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
A little. Just a little bit.

557
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,500
Here's the coffee.

558
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,040
Here's the coffee.

559
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,720
Iced Americano.

560
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,320
Thank you.

561
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,640
It sounds bitter.

562
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Where's my coffee?

563
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,360
How can you drink coffee when you are like this?

564
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,620
What does that matter?

565
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,080
By the way,

566
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
Li Jianjian even adds sugar

567
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,860
to Caramel Macchiato.

568
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
That's because life is too bitter.

569
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,480
I put the spare clothes and toiletries

570
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,200
for you and Ling Xiao

571
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,560
in the bag.

572
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,200
I have an interview this evening.

573
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,730
But I can stay here with you.

574
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,120
No.

575
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,440
My brother is here. It's fine.

576
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,360
Is Ling Xiao really fine

577
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,840
with his sleep disorder?

578
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,920
How can he be fine when he couldn't sleep?

579
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,600
Do you think

580
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,440
it has anything to do with his mom?

581
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,320
Of course it has.

582
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,120
You know

583
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
why he went to university in Singapore.

584
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,920
Because of his mom.

585
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,320
I knew it was weird

586
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,920
that his mom

587
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,850
suddenly allowed him to come back.

588
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,920
Take care. Your brother

589
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,080
may go back one day.

590
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,960
Isn't his younger sister

591
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
very clingy to him?

592
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,680
Why are you staring at me?

593
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,210
I'm just telling the truth.

594
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
I was not a baby a long time ago!

595
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
He has legs,

596
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,210
so he can go wherever he wants to go.

597
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,320
And boys are outgoing.

598
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,600
Maybe one day,

599
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,440
he'll go with

600
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,600
a woman from nowhere.

601
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,080
Right?

602
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,800
You just can't help it.

603
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,980
Where did you park the car?

604
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,880
Across the way.

605
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,080
You go back. I'm leaving.

606
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,320
OK. Take care.

607
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,800
Drive safely.

608
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,680
Just go!

609
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,760
Give me a bite.

610
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,650
It will give you excessive internal heat.

611
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,680
Are you hungry?

612
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,960
Dad brought you porridge.

613
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
Have you drunk it all?

614
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,000
Seeing you guys eating food,

615
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,040
I feel bored

616
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,700
without anything in my mouth.

617
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
Let's go home tonight

618
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,880
and come back here tomorrow.

619
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,160
You have to be hospitalized for two days

620
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,490
until you are all right.

621
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,560
The thing is if I don't go back to the shop,

622
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,760
no one makes desserts.

623
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,720
Put your career aside

624
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,050
and regain your health.

625
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,200
I remember when we were young,

626
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,600
the sky wasn't like this.

627
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
Do you remember?

628
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
When we were young, we enjoyed the cool air in the summer in the neighborhood.

629
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Dad told us that

630
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,360
except for the moon in the sky,

631
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,440
the brightest star

632
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,480
was the Great White Golden Star.

633
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,160
I can't see anything.

634
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,320
Of course you can't.

635
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,780
Now the city is illuminated by light.

636
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,840
It's different from it was

637
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,900
when we were young.

638
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,690
Is it the same in Singapore?

639
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,100
It's also very bright,

640
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,560
unless you go to the mountains

641
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,880
where there is no light,

642
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,410
or when the weather is good.

643
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,760
Let's go to the mountains

644
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,480
to Aunt He Lan's place.

645
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,240
I'm not going there.

646
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,040
Her toilet

647
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,200
sits next to the pigpen.

648
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,480
Her family stopped raising pigs a long time ago!

649
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,720
That doesn't make it OK.

650
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,180
We shouldn't bother them.

651
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,880
You are right.

652
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
When I call them in the spring festival and other festivals,

653
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I feel I have nothing to talk with them.

654
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,330
It's normal.

655
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,840
You don't live together.

656
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,040
What do you have to talk?

657
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,000
You can only talk about

658
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,160
your childhood

659
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,760
again and again.

660
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,320
Have I told you?

661
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,140
During my first days in UK,

662
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,880
I always wanted to come back.

663
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
Language barrier

664
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,280
and different eating habits were killing me.

665
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,410
I fought with Zhao Huaguang every day.

666
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,560
Every time I saw a plane

667
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,640
flying over the sky,

668
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,500
I wanted to jump on it and get back.

669
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,290
You told us about it.

670
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,180
And I can understand you well.

671
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,290
Just like all the TV series say,

672
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,920
those who are born with a silver spoon

673
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,120
will never inherit the family wealth quietly.

674
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,440
I hope to do them a favor and inherit the wealth,

675
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,040
but no one comes to me for the favor.

676
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
I want your favor.

677
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,280
All the money I make in the future

678
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,080
will be yours.

679
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,720
No, no, no!

680
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,690
You should never believe a man's promise.

681
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,160
Talk is cheap.

682
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,240
Since you are so smart,

683
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,840
just hurry up and dump that Shuran.

684
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,600
Why should I dump him? We are good.

685
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,960
Yeah, hurry up and dump him.

686
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,440
He is not a good person at first sight.

687
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,800
Why's he not a good person?

688
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,960
We've known each other for years.

689
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,880
I know everything about him.

690
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,480
You know everything about him?

691
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,720
A crazy man like him

692
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,250
can never be a good husband.

693
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,760
I just want a sweetheart,

694
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,360
not a husband.

695
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,930
You really like him?

696
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,480
Yes.

697
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,840
Think it over.

698
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,340
Do you sincerely like him?

699
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,480
Anyway, I'm happy with him.

700
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
That's bullshit!

701
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,880
What?

702
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,320
You brother said he's a piece of shit!

703
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,600
Bullshit!

704
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
My brother won't say the word "shit"!

705
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Ask him yourself!

706
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,400
Ling Xiao!

707
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,320
Is he slandering you?

708
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,480
Am I slandering you?

709
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Of course you are.

710
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
Don't beat me when you are like this.

711
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,760
Shouldn't I beat you?

712
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,620
Give me a bite of the sweet potato.

713
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,120
No way!

714
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,200
Why not?

715
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
It will give you excessive internal heat.

716
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,680
Just a bite.

717
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,080
Just a bite.

718
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,520
No!

719
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,860
Are you kidding me?

720
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,210
I'm not messing with you. Here you are.

721
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,400
Gross!

722
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,560
If I can't eat it, then no one can.

723
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,690
Anyone who sits on the bench eats shit!

724
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,800
Give me a hand!

725
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,800
Get up. Get up.

726
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,690
I can't stand on my legs.

727
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,800
No way!

728
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,670
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

729
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,710
Sit down.

730
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,600
Seriously?

731
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,130
Is it fun to kid me like this?

732
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
It's 38.5 degree.

733
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,320
Don't worry. When you have inflammation,

734
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,480
it's normal to have a fever.

735
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,739
Let him take the pills.

736
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,710
Drink more water and see what's going on.

737
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,760
All right, thank you.

738
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,690
You are welcome.

739
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,980
Take the pills.

740
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,690
Come on. Take the pills.

741
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,190
Drink more. Drink more.

742
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,520
The doctor said you must drink more water.

743
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Enough, enough.

744
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,690
Why don't you sleep a while?

745
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,970
I'm not sleepy. I'm a night person.

746
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
You should sleep.

747
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,280
You look so filial now.

748
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,330
Don't take advantage of me.

749
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,660
The word "filial" can't be used here.

750
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,600
Sleep.

751
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
Mingyue also brought you a book?

752
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,680
It's the one beside my bed.

753
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,920
When I can't sleep,

754
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,880
I read the book.

755
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,800
It's a picture book. You won't feel tired reading it.

756
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,280
The book you like?

757
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,840
What is it about?

758
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,760
It's about two lonely kids

759
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,970
trying to escape the city they live in.

760
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
He's very silent

761
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,560
and has never greeted others.

762
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
All my classmates think

763
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,400
he's a weirdo.

764
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,360
But I think he's all right.

765
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Sometimes,

766
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,640
I also don't want to talk.

767
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
I often see him

768
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
reading books quietly

769
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,800
in a corner of the bookstore,

770
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,360
completely ignoring the world around him.

771
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,120
I don't know why

772
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
I always meet him

773
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,240
at all kinds of places.

774
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,600
He looks

775
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,680
as withdrawn as I am.

776
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Hello, could you check out

777
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,760
which ward He Ziqiu is in?

778
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,960
Sure. Wait a moment, please.

779
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,600
Thank you.

780
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,960
Ling Xiao!

781
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,890
No need to check out. Thank you.

782
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,200
Which ward Ziqiu is in?

783
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,640
I searched for a long time yet failed to find it.

784
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,370
Come with me.

785
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:46,920
OK.

786
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,640
I haven't even taken care of my dad

787
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,960
like this before!

788
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,480
Take it easy!

789
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,680
Don't rub my wound!

790
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,520
Why do you have so much to say?

791
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,490
Raise your head.

792
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,970
Li Jianjian!

793
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,600
Shuran!

794
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,920
You come here so early!

795
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,840
Why are you grabbing me?

796
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,570
You haven't finished your job!

797
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,640
Have a seat.

798
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,970
I have to clean his body.

799
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,440
OK.

800
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,800
Are you OK?

801
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,940
Fine. I'm fine.

802
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,200
Is Ziqiu all right?

803
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,840
Do I look all right to you?

804
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,080
Mind your tone!

805
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,450
By the way, I brought you a gift.

806
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,040
What's inside the box?

807
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,000
I made it myself.

808
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,640
Ling Xiao!

809
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,120
Open it and see.

810
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,640
Thank you.

811
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,960
Why don't I know this?

812
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
I made it in recent days.

813
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,880
It's the only one.

814
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,360
What's that?

815
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,760
How can we accept such a gift?

816
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,000
Don't mention it.

817
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,000
Your brother is like my brother.

818
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,240
Thank you so much!

819
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,170
You are welcome.

820
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,720
Well, Patient 12,

821
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,050
take your temperature.

822
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
It's 37.6 degree. A little bit too high.

823
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,800
You are almost fine.

824
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,260
When can I leave hospital?

825
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,800
Wait till the doctor finishes

826
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,530
making the rounds of the wards.

827
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,450
What is he doing?

828
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,560
Come on. I didn't clean this side.

829
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,200
Lie down. Lie down.

830
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,760
I haven't finished this side.

831
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,200
No.

832
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,020
I haven't finished that side.

833
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
This side isn't clean. Don't move!

834
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,880
Making art.

835
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,480
He's making art. Making art.

836
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,200
Ling Xiao, where are you going?

837
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,260
I can take you over.

838
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,810
Do you have time now?

839
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,960
Yes.

840
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I work at night.

841
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
It's almost noon.

842
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Let me treat you to lunch.

843
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,130
Go. I have something to ask you.

844
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,240
OK.

845
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Anyway, there were all kinds of people

846
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,360
in the sculpture forum.

847
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,440
Many of them kept criticizing me specially,

848
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,800
saying my works were meaningless

849
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,880
and I was playing to the gallery.

850
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,520
If Li Jianjian

851
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,320
hadn't encouraged me to hold on,

852
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,880
I would have changed my major

853
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,010
because of the blow.

854
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,460
I was asking you

855
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,200
why you like Li Jianjian.

856
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,360
All of these are the reasons.

857
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,920
I can't find a reason

858
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,780
not to like her.

859
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,160
But she hasn't got

860
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,920
the waist-hip ratio that catches your eye.

861
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,720
You are right.

862
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,160
But it doesn't matter.

863
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,840
What I want

864
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,920
is a soul mate.

865
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,760
Physical attraction

866
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,890
can never last long.

867
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
So you're admitting that

868
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
she's not attractive to you.

869
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,890
Of course she is.

870
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,000
Last time, I met her

871
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,880
at the sculpture exhibition.

872
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,520
I felt she was so alive,

873
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,680
as if she was growing freely in the wild.

874
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
And I was touched.

875
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,280
You don't have a younger sister, do you?

876
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,340
I'm the only child,

877
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,200
so do my parents.

878
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
So I have no cousins, either.

879
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,200
Therefore, when you met Li Jianjian,

880
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,960
you just hoped

881
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,360
she could be at your home.

882
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,560
That's right.

883
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,800
At that moment,

884
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
I felt Li Jianjian

885
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,480
should be at my home,

886
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,560
bringing vitality to the place.

887
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,220
How interesting will that be!

888
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,600
I can understand you.

889
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,740
Many only children

890
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,840
want to have

891
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,900
a brother or sister

892
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,460
to play together. That's really lively.

893
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,970
That's not what I meant.

894
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,800
I really like her.

895
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Think again.

896
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,090
You two can be good friends.

897
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,800
But as for starting a relationship, you have to reconsider it.

898
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,520
It's just a relationship. What do I have to reconsider?

899
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,780
Reconsider carefully

900
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,120
whether it is worthwhile

901
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,640
losing a good friend

902
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,800
who may touch your soul

903
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,930
In exchange for a short relationship.

904
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,480
Let's have lunch.
