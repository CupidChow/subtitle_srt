Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 14

4
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,320
Don't sway.

5
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
What do you think?

6
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
We used to be

7
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
very close

8
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
but that’s because we were still young

9
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
and played together.

10
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,520
But later…

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,660
When I was still a student,

12
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,320
I indeed hoped

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
that they could

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
come back on holidays,

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,720
but neither of them came back.

16
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,720
Gradually,

17
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
I forgot it.

18
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Now they

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,090
suddenly came back,

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
which made

21
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,520
uneasy and embarrassed.

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,960
I feel

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,760
they're strangers to me.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,290
I don't feel the same as before.

25
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,680
When they left, you were sophomore in high school.

26
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,760
Think about it.

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,360
When we meet

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,480
our high school classmates now,

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,810
we may not be able to remember their names.

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
But they're different

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,160
from classmates.

32
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
So I

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,240
feel so bad now.

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,620
I feel so embarrassed.

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,280
But,

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
if we don't

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,080
get along well,

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,920
my dad and Mr. Ling

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,040
will be unhappy.

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,760
Tang Can gave me

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
an inspiration just now.

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,240
What is it?

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,320
What is it?

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Let me tell you.

45
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,040
Every time when I go back to my hometown with my dad

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
to offer sacrifices to ancestors,

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
those relatives,

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,400
the more they're unfamiliar with me,

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,440
the warmer

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,400
and kinder they are to me.

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,600
I can

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,360
treat them as

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,880
distant relatives who

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,079
I haven't seen for years.

55
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,560
Yeah. Just like when I meet customers.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,840
Life is like a play, and acting is most important.

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,400
I'll teach you later.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,660
Treat them as distant relatives?

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,040
How?

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,640
It's easy.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,200
Enthusiastic,

62
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
kind

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,160
and smile.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,730
There're three important points.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,480
Okay.

66
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,320
I've figured it out.

67
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,380
I'm going to sleep.

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll call my two distant relatives

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,480
and ask them

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,160
to go back home for dinner tomorrow.

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,840
It'll make my dads

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,040
happy.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,690
Sleep early,

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
or you'll be ugly.

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,070
You gave a bad idea!

76
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,840
You did.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,400
Coming.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,200
Oh, God.

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
Good morning.

80
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,450
You're so early.

81
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,200
Last Friday was Mr. Ling's birthday,

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
but he worked overtime,

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
so we forgot to celebrate it for him.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,880
I called my dad

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,520
today and decided to

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,240
celebrate it tonight.

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
You're good at making cake.

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,160
Would you like to show your good skills?

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Okay.

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,720
So, would you like to tell them

91
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,840
you're back

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,960
before tonight?

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Yeah.

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,520
Okay.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
Do you plan to

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
give my dad a surprise?

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,880
You don't need to.

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,920
Your going back

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,720
is the biggest surprise to them.

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
Is it?

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Is it a surprise to you too?

102
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,920
Yes.

103
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,560
It's a big surprise to me.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm going to the studio.

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
See you later.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm going to pick you up tonight.

107
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,440
No need. See you tonight.

108
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
Be careful on the way.

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
Do you plan to

110
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,159
give my dad a surprise?

111
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,520
My dad?

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
What does it mean?

113
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:10,440
[Time garden]

114
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Jianjian,

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Zhou Miao asks for a day off

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,560
as he needs to attend an activity of the club.

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,440
You hired him.

118
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
You'll be in charge of it.

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,920
Look at the lines.

120
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,840
So smooth and stubborn.

121
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,760
It must be a great work.

122
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
We've stocked enough materials.

123
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,840
The warehouse is almost filled.

124
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,400
I warn you.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Before you finish all these,

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
you can't go to see the new materials.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,130
We don't have money.

128
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I'll work hard.

129
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,960
Li Jianjian, let's go into a relationship.

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,450
Try to close your mouth.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
It's not good enough.

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,490
Doctor Ling,

133
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,240
a woman named Chen Ting

134
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,320
keeps calling you.

135
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,820
Is it anything urgent?

136
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,090
Leave her alone.

137
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,320
Use these two temporary teeth first.

138
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,400
When the ceramic teeth are done,

139
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,480
we'll contact you.

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,320
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

141
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
This way, please.

142
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,720
Stop crying.

143
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,200
I told you

144
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,280
not to have chocolate

145
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,920
after you brush your teeth at night,

146
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,840
but you just didn't listen.

147
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Now you have so many decayed teeth.

148
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
You can't even bite tofu.

149
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
You must go to see a doctor.

150
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you know?

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,280
No.

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Little girl, if you don't see a doctor,

153
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,010
all your teeth will be decayed.

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't be afraid.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,669
The doctor will eliminate

156
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,669
all the little worms

157
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,470
in your teeth.

158
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,299
After that,

159
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,770
you can have as much chocolate as you like.

160
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
It's for you.

161
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
You should say thank you.

162
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,760
Thank you, sir.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,730
Little girl,

164
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,400
let's go to

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,920
see the doctor, okay?

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Little girl,

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,640
do you like

168
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,880
this doctor?

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,440
How about asking him

170
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
to treat you?

171
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Okay. I'll do it.

172
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
Song has gone to see the patient off.

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,280
Please help me get prepared.

174
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Okay, no problem.

175
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
I'd like a cup of iced Americano. Thanks.

176
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,120
Okay.

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,660
And a cup of hot Americano.

178
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
I'll pay them together.

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,200
Okay.

180
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Hello, Doctor Ling.

181
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,720
My name is Feng Xixi.

182
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
You may call me Xixi.

183
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,160
Hello.

184
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,160
Thank you for helping me

185
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,520
persuade that kid.

186
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,090
I'm afraid of kids most.

187
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,160
You're welcome, Doctor Feng.

188
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,920
I can't tell that

189
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,780
you're good at dealing with kids.

190
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,720
Do you have any tips?

191
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
I have a sister.

192
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
That's why.

193
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm the only child.

194
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
Do you have

195
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,160
any other strange toys?

196
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,280
Give me one, please.

197
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,960
I still have three more.

198
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,520
I'll give it to my sister after going back home.

199
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
How old is your sister?

200
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,560
25.

201
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,800
I just want one.

202
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Sorry, but I also have a brother.

203
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,000
Is your brother also 25?

204
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,120
No, 27.

205
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,060
And I'll blow the last one.

206
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
So you just don't want to give me one.

207
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
Your coffee.

208
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,080
Thanks.

209
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,680
Thanks.

210
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,280
Soup Noodles with Beef Brisket.

211
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,540
Noodles with Satay Sauce.

212
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
May I help you?

213
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
I got this.

214
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,080
I can do the introduction.

215
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,440
This restaurant offers Soup Noodles with Pork Ribs,

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,880
Soup Noodles with Beef Brisket,

217
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Noodles Mixed with Scallion Oil and Soy Sauce,

218
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,520
and Noodles with Mixed Sauce and Bean.

219
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
If you can't eat chili,

220
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
you can ask for no chili.

221
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,060
I don't understand what you said.

222
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
Can you speak Chinese?

223
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,400
Aren't you a foreigner?

224
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,640
I'm a native of Sichuan.

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,720
A native of Sichuan?

226
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
I saw you spent a long time on checking the menu.

227
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,720
I thought you…

228
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm a Libra.

229
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,880
I have allodoxaphobia. Okay?

230
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,920
Okay. Okay.

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Sorry. Sorry.

232
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,200
I'd like a bowl of Noodles with Three Fresh Ingredients.

233
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

234
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
Wait.

235
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,940
I… I want Soup Noodles with Beef Brisket.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,160
Soup Noodles with Beef Brisket. 25 yuan.

237
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,240
Chef, a portion of Soup Noodles with Beef Brisket.

238
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,880
Got it.

239
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,920
Thank you.

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,560
Did you study abroad?

241
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,250
Your English is so good.

242
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,260
What would you like to eat?

243
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
I'd like…

244
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,400
I guess you'd like

245
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,680
Noodles with Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Is this you?

247
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
Boss said

248
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,120
Jianjian likes sweet food,

249
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,280
you like noodles,

250
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,640
and Ling Xiao likes meat,

251
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
so he created this kind of noodles.

252
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,340
All you three will like it.

253
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
It isn't on the menu.

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
No one expect you will order it.

255
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,560
Okay. I'd like that.

256
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
Ziqiu?

257
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,720
Dad.

258
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,760
You're back.

259
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm back.

260
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,600
Well… So good.

261
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,680
It's been so long since you came back last time.

262
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,540
Shouldn't you kowtow to your dad?

How about

284
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,200
I take you to a KTV

285
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,360
to sing to relax tonight?

286
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,600
No.

287
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,520
Some relatives visit my home tonight.

288
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
I need to go home.

289
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
All right.

290
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,360
Juan,

291
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,720
should I

292
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,050
go into a relationship?

293
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,840
You should.

294
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,600
You think so?

295
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,200
Well, you're already 25.

296
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,000
You deal with woods every day.

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,240
You have never been in a relationship.

298
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
This is not artist style.

299
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,140
It seems right.

300
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,000
It seems?

301
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,280
It is.

302
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,720
You've run out of

303
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,800
inspiration

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,460
and creativity recently.

305
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,400
Love can sometimes

306
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,880
bring you

307
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,440
new excitement.

308
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,400
Those male artists

309
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,800
created works

310
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,760
with girlfriend

311
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,560
as the theme.

312
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,040
It sounds reasonable.

313
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,520
But,

314
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,040
when did any man

315
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,770
I don't know appear beside you?

316
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
He's a net friend.

317
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,840
Cyber love?

318
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,960
That's not artist style.

319
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,090
It's not cyber love.

320
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,560
We're just net friends.

321
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,290
You know him.

322
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,920
It's Ran whom I've known for years.

323
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,960
He?

324
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
This is artist style, right?

325
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,660
This is exactly artist style.

326
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,120
Did you meet each other?

327
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,880
No.

328
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,040
Last time, we agreed to

329
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,200
meet in the exhibition hall.

330
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Later, I made a foolish figure

331
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,040
and went to the police station.

332
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,170
So I didn't meet him.

333
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,760
Good.

334
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
But I don't think he's a good choice.

335
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
Why?

336
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,080
From his works,

337
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,480
I feel his almost mythical

338
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,080
sense of worship

339
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,440
for females.

340
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,240
This kind of sense of worship is beautiful,

341
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,970
but particularly vulnerable.

342
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,360
Based on my years of

343
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,640
love experience,

344
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,280
people like him

345
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
may be

346
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,440
very ugly.

347
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
I think you should

348
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
see his photo first.

349
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,680
It must be taken

350
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
by front-facing camera

351
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,140
without beautification.

352
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,900
Go on with the work.

353
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,740
Change your shoes.

354
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Why are you standing in a daze? Come on in.

355
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Give it to me.

356
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,600
Come in.

357
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,640
Ziqiu.

358
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,520
Dad.

359
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,880
Where's your coffee shop?

360
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,640
It's on the street

361
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,970
nearby our high school.

362
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,440
It was also a coffee shop.

363
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,720
But later, the owner gave it up

364
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,000
and transferred it to me.

365
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,320
I redecorated it.

366
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,800
It'll be open in two days.

367
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,720
Well, dad,

368
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,000
you may go with Mr. Ling

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
to have a look.

370
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,880
In fact, I wanted to

371
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,040
give you a surprise.

372
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,450
Your coming back is a surprise.

373
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,880
Well,

374
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,480
you should've told me about it.

375
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,280
If you told me,

376
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,840
I could help you select materials for decoration.

377
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,920
I didn't tell you

378
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,800
because I didn't want you to be busy.

379
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,120
If knew it, you'd do a lot of things.

380
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,650
I was afraid you'd be tried.

381
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,400
Even so, I'd be happy.

382
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,400
I just don't want you to be tired.

383
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,560
Ziqiu,

384
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,880
what did your dad say

385
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,480
about your coming back?

386
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,280
Why mention him?

387
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,109
He has nothing to do with me.

388
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,480
Besides, you're my dad.

389
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,280
Well, even so,

390
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,440
he paid your tuition

391
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
and living expenses

392
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
these years.

393
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,360
Though you don't like him,

394
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,720
you shouldn't hurt his feelings.

395
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,760
Dad, I know.

396
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,560
Can we not talk about him at home?

397
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,890
Okay, okay. Let's stop talking about him.

398
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,070
[ Certificate of Honor]

399
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,240
This fridge is still being used.

400
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,640
It has been so many years.

401
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,050
It still works, so we've been using it.

402
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
Freezing preservation

403
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,320
is popular now.

404
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,720
I'll buy a new one for you.

405
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,520
Don't do that.

406
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,730
It's quite good.

407
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,620
Don't be prodigal right after you come back.

408
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,000
It makes no noises without frost.

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,130
It still can be used.

410
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Dad,

411
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,280
does someone

412
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,120
live in my room?

413
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,800
Jianjian called

414
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,800
this morning.

415
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,740
She was so mysterious,

416
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,450
saying that someone would come today.

417
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,400
I guessed it was you.

418
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,080
How could you guess it?

419
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
You must be missing your sons again.

420
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,680
One came back yesterday.

421
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,320
When will the other one come back?

422
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,280
He's in the UK.

423
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
It takes him over ten hours

424
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,000
to come back by plane.

425
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,800
How can he come back at will?

426
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,970
Which one is more handsome?

427
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,440
This one.

428
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,160
This one.

429
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,490
He looks a bit familiar.

430
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,440
I seem to have met him before.

431
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Oh, I remember.

432
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,450
This is your son, right?

433
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
Can you enlarge it?

434
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,960
It's…it's Ziqiu!

435
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,920
I've seen him several times.

436
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,440
Why didn't he go home?

437
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
Back then,

438
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,920
when I took you here

439
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,360
from the village,

440
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,370
you were so active doing housework

441
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,520
after you came to this home,

442
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,850
because you were afraid I'd send you back.

443
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,600
You boy

444
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,520
just think too much.

445
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,920
You love to

446
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,360
take the burdens.

447
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,680
I said

448
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,360
I'd come back after graduation,

449
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,620
but I didn't come back.

450
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
I got a rich dad

451
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,580
and I had been away for several years.

452
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,900
I think anyone who meets with such a thing

453
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,340
will be disappointed.

454
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,320
We often talked on the phone.

455
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,640
Have I ever blamed you?

456
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,120
How could you think like that?

457
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,800
I know you never blame me.

458
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,800
But I think

459
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,340
I'm ungrateful to you.

460
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,920
Ungrateful?

461
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,320
All parents

462
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,680
want their kids to be good.

463
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,600
As long as the kids grow into good people,

464
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
the parents will be happy.

465
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
If you grew into a bad person

466
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
and became a disaster to the society,

467
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,940
you'd be ungrateful to me.

468
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,880
I'm not well-educated.

469
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,040
I can only

470
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
be a chef in this life.

471
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
I just hope

472
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,250
my kids can receive good education

473
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,280
and can fly higher in the future.

474
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,200
To say the least,

475
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,560
it doesn't matter if you can't fly high.

476
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
I'll be satisfied

477
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,450
if you can live a happy life.

478
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,080
And,

479
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm still young

480
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,360
and running a noodle restaurant.

481
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm living a happy life.

482
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
You don't need to worry about me.

483
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Well,

484
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,240
don't cry.

485
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,260
I don't cry.

486
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,540
I just don't feel good.

487
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah. You don't cry.

488
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
It's windy.

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,200
Dad, well…

490
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,360
All other parents

491
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,040
hope their children

492
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
will have a bright future,

493
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,320
but you hope

494
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,000
your son will only live a happy life.

495
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,330
It's such a simple wish.

496
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,480
It's not simple.

497
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,480
No one can be happy

498
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,480
for a lifetime.

499
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,160
Dad, I love to chat with you.

500
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,480
When chatting with you,

501
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
I'll forget the time.

502
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,760
Okay. Then let's often chat.

503
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,280
Why do you rub your fingers

504
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,880
while chatting?

505
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,480
The nails are all worn.

506
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,880
If you want to use your hands,

507
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,680
you may help me trim vegetables.

508
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,400
You loved to

509
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,760
be my assistant before.

510
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,440
So good.

511
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,600
You're back,

512
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
and so is Ling Xiao.

513
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,240
The family is reunited again.

514
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,720
So good.

515
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,410
When will you move back?

516
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,760
I'm not moving back.

517
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,000
I rent a house

518
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,240
opposite the apartment where Li Jianjian lives.

519
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,640
Ling Xiao and I have decided to

520
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
to live together.

521
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Just like before,

522
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,660
we'll look after Li Jianjian.

523
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,680
But it's near here,

524
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
so we can often come back.

525
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,560
Okay.

526
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,760
It's good.

527
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,680
Dad, anyway,

528
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm not leaving this time.

529
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,170
I'll just stay with you.

530
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,200
Don't stay with us every day.

531
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
It's annoying to see each often.

532
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,810
Dad, don't think I'm annoying.

533
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,680
Jianjian.

534
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,400
Mrs. Qian?

535
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
You're back.

536
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,800
Are you going to dance again?

537
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes. They asked me to be the lead dancer.

538
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,500
They said it can't be organized if I don't go.

539
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,040
Jianjian,

540
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,800
I heard

541
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
your brothers are back.

542
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,480
Your dad

543
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
will live a happy life.

544
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,600
As they all said,

545
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,640
in this yard,

546
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,680
your dad is the luckiest.

547
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,920
I'll treat your whole family

548
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,240
to dinner later.

549
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
Okay. See you, Mrs. Qian.

550
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,800
See you.

to eat fish balls secretly.

♫I see myself with big wings♫

584

Mr. Ling, I've prepared a gift for you.

585
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,420
Thank you, son.

586
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,220
Well, you're so considerate.

587
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,340
Dad, this is yours.

588
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,600
Do I also have one?

589
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,840
It's my birthday.

590
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,080
Why did you buy him a gift?

591
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,280
It's the same.

592
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,340
Don't be so mean. It's the kid's care.

593
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,040
Check it.

594
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
It's good.

595
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,520
Not bad, uh?

596
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,680
Little bird.

597
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
Swallow.

598
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,560
Isn't swallow a bird?

599
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,920
Fine, it's a bird. I don't want to argue with you.

600
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,520
I think I'm too old for it.

601
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,920
No, no. It fits you well.

602
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,680
Really?

603
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,700
I'll try them on. I'll try them on.

604
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,370
Li Jianjian,

605
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,810
this is a bag for you.

606
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Thank you, Zi…

607
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,520
What's wrong? Open it.

608
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
This…this is too expensive!

609
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,970
It's not expensive.

610
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,770
Don't worry.

611
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,960
When I make more money in the future,

612
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,800
I'll buy you anything you like.

613
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,240
Take it.

614
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,960
It's such a small bag.

615
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
How expensive can it be?

616
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,560
Yeah. Don't take your brother as an outsider.

617
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,120
Take it.

618
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,320
Okay. Thank you, Ziqiu.

619
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,320
Don't buy me any more bags in the future.

620
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,120
It's okay.

621
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,280
Well.

622
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
You didn't tell me you came back,

623
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,920
so I didn't buy you a gift.

624
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,440
It doesn't matter. I didn't buy you a gift either.

625
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,280
Okay.

626
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
Son, you can wear this pair of shoes.

627
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,880
It's so good.

628
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,480
Dad, my feet are too big to wear them.

629
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
The hot pot is boiling.

630
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,320
Dads, brothers, let's enjoy dinner!

631
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,040
Come on. Have dinner.

632
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Have dinner first.

633
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,520
Have dinner. Have dinner.

634
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,200
Have dinner. Have dinner.

635
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,760
Take it off.

636
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
Take them off. Put them here first.

637
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,480
Let's enjoy dinner!

638
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,280
Well, dad went to the market

639
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,200
early in the morning

640
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,440
to buy the crabs.

641
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,880
It must have much cream.

642
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,560
It's Mr. Ling's birthday.

643
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,680
I planned to

644
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,080
make several dishes,

645
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,040
but he

646
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,800
insisted on having hot pot.

647
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,920
We had hot pot

648
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,120
at my every birthday.

649
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
It's hot and bustling.

650
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,720
I treated Jianjian's teeth yesterday.

651
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,800
Her inflammation hasn't gone away yet.

652
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
She can't have spicy food.

653
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,330
Did you treat her teeth?

654
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,480
Ling Xiao majored in dentistry.

655
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,840
Jianjian uttered dreary cries and screams

656
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,720
whenever she went to

657
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,760
a dental clinic in her childhood.

658
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,480
Her dreary cries and screams

659
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,800
could be heard very far away.

660
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,400
Ling Xiao studied it for her.

661
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,880
Now he's back.

662
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,880
When we have teeth problem in the future,

663
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,160
we can turn to Ling Xiao.

664
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
He's just our doctor.

665
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,820
Well, Xiao.

666
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,620
I'll often trouble you later.

667
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,520
I'll replace alcohol with coconut juice.

668
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,920
I'll drink a toast to you.

669
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,930
Oh, Mr. Ling.

670
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,640
Well…

671
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,080
I made you a birthday cake.

672
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,410
I made it this morning. I'm going to get it.

673
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,240
You made it?

674
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,800
He told you

675
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,160
on the phone

676
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,080
he learns to make dessert now.

677
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,920
He wants to be a dessert chef.

678
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,400
In this case, Jianjian

679
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,840
can't leave Ziqiu more in the future.

680
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,360
Mr. Ling, happy birthday.

681
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,480
Thank you, son.

682
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,880
He made it. Look.

683
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,160
Thank you, son.

684
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
I'll also trouble you in the future.

685
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,920
Where's the candle? Dad needs to make a wish.

686
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,840
Insert the candle and make a wish.

687
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,360
Yeah.

688
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm going to get the candle.

689
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,060
It's okay. I'll go.

690
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,200
Wait. why do you have a scar here?

691
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,960
It's fine. Sit down. I'm going to get the candle.

692
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,720
It's fine?

693
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
It's such a big scar. How was it left?

694
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,800
What scar?

695
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,480
What scar?

696
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Let me see. What scar?

697
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
It's on the shoulder. Look.

698
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,680
Let me see. Let me see.

699
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,520
Let me see.

700
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,640
My God!

701
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,640
It's such a big scar!

702
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
How did you get it?

703
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,280
It's okay.

704
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,360
I just got scalded by accident.

705
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Got scalded?

706
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,160
How come?

707
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,520
When?

708
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,480
Why didn't you tell us

709
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,360
about this matter?

710
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,380
I was far away from you.

711
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,000
Even if I told you,

712
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,530
it'd only make you worried.

713
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,280
When dad went out on mission,

714
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,840
he fell from the stairs by accident.

715
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,040
His leg was broken and suffered cerebral concussion.

716
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,640
Hadn't I found

717
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
the time was not right

718
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,400
and asked you,

719
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,520
you wouldn't tell me either.

720
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,160
Wait.

721
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,720
When did Mr. Ling

722
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,080
have a broken leg and cerebral concussion?

723
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,760
Why didn't you tell me?

724
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,800
I didn't know it at all.

725
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
It's no use telling you.

726
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
You couldn't come back to look after him.

727
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,280
I…

728
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,640
Come on, enjoy the hot pot.

729
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,000
Look, the soup has been boiling.

730
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,320
Yeah.

731
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,960
Enjoy the hot pot. Enjoy the hot pot.

732
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,600
Come on.

733
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,120
Enjoy the hot pot.

734
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,800
Come on.

735
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,480
Yeah.

736
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,320
Enjoy the hot pot. Enjoy the hot pot.

737
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,680
Come on.

738
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,080
Here you are. Have a ball.

739
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,320
Mr. Ling,

740
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,520
your daughter

741
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,880
prepared such a big meal for you today.

742
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,760
Are you happy?

743
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,560
Of course.

744
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,800
Did you buy the meat

745
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,000
or did you trim the vegetables?

746
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,640
Why did you say

747
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,200
you prepared the meal?

748
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,960
Be gentle. My ear's gonna drop.

749
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,400
If I had only one ear, who would marry me?

750
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,080
You have two ears, but does anyone want to marry you?

751
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,610
Am I your natural daughter?

752
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,690
You're my natural daughter. Mine.

753
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,680
Come on. Enjoy it.

754
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,600
Ling Xiao, enjoy the balls.

755
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
I made them for you guys.

756
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,000
Okay.

757
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,810
Here you are. Have meat.

758
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,090
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

759
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,620
It's a gift for you.

760
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,490
I'll give you one in return.

761
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,400
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,600
two hours ahead of time tomorrow.

771

I'll move there.

It doesn't matter.

773
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
Just stop here. Go up.

774
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,280
I'll go to hail a taxi with you.

775
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,810
No need. I'll send you back.

776
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Did you buy a car?

777
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,920
It's not expensive.

778
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,640
I parked it

779
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,700
at the door of the noodle restaurant.

780
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,840
Go.

781
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,840
Nice electric bicycle.

782
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,640
Lovely.

783
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
It's a second-hand one

784
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,890
I found on the Internet.

785
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,120
Though it looks old,

786
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,360
it's pretty good.

787
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,080
Look here.

788
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,920
Its carrying capacity

789
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,400
can just support our weight.

790
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,240
I'll ride slowly.

791
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,700
Come on.

792
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,960
Get on.

793
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,880
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

794
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,890
I can fix it. It doesn't matter.

795
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,280
I'll take you to hail a taxi.

796
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,840
No need. I'll go by myself.

797
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,320
Who's that?

798
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,480
My boyfriend.

799
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I'm going to hail a taxi ahead.

800
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,780
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

801

Does Li Jianjian have a boyfriend?

My God!

804
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,600
Li Jianjian, wait for me.

805
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,160
I'm going.

806
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,440
Great.

807
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,920
I'm hailing a taxi now.

808
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,360
Sir, go.

809
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,880
It's good.

810
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,320
Isn't this feeling

811
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,680
what you want?

812
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,230
I'm here just to

813
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,630
talk about my brothers.

814
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,520
They're back.

815
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,670
Yeah.

816
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,120
They went to

817
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,760
study in other cities,

818
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,600
but now they

819
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
live right opposite me.

820
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,560
It's so troublesome.

I don't know if

I'm too sensitive.

I think

831
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,880
they look at me in the way

832
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,600
they did in childhood,

833
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,040
when we

834
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,170
just met each other.

835
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,920
I think

836
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,820
it's a feeling of loneliness.

837
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Wait.

838
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,480
Ling Xiao, how's your visit

839
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
to your dad?

840
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,800
You didn't answer my call.

841
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,560
Was it inconvenient

842
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
as you were

843
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,080
with your classmates?

844
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,600
Don't worry about me

845
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,600
or your

846
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,000
naughty sister.

847
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,720
I told her not to

848
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,440
call you to bother you

849
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,450
so that you can have a good time.

850
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,280
But, don't play for too long.

851
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,080
After your annual leave for two years,

852
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,760
go back to the hospital to work.

853
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,400
Don't make your leaders unhappy.

854
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,720
It'll affect your future work.

855
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,520
Am I right?

856
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,320
By the way,

857
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,840
when I passed by a bookstore yesterday,

858
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,760
I bought several new recipes.

859
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,840
I have lots of time at home.

860
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,800
I will learn to make more dishes.

861
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,240
The only thing I can do now

862
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
is to take care of

863
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,370
you and your sister.

864
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,080
And,

865
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,120
you like the dishes

866
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,680
Li Haichao makes.

867
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,840
You ask him

868
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,400
for the tips.

869
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,840
I'll learn later.

870
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,720
If you like

871
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,360
any specialty,

872
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,960
tell me on WeChat

873
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,120
at any time anywhere.

874
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,520
I'll keep it down.

875
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Just tell me the dish name.

876
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,160
I'll search it on the Internet

877
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,640
and send you the picture

878
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,280
to confirm it.

879
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,080
Well, girl,

880
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,880
your noodles.

881
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,920
Thanks.

882
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
So,

883
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
you won't come back to live at night?

884
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,400
Enjoy the noodles, Mr. Ling.

885
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,480
Okay.

886
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,800
Remember

887
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,720
to call me often.

888
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,120
Okay.

889
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,940
Noodles Served with Beef Tallow.

890
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,660
Thank you, dad.

891
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,720
Eat more meat. You're thinner again.

892
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,840
Zhu,

893
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,560
two bowls of seafood noodles.

894
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,280
Okay, Mrs. Qian.

895
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,340
Please have a seat.

896
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,960
Okay.

897
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,760
Is there any available seat?

898
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,640
Mrs. Qian, Mrs. He, sit here.

899
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,720
Heping is also here.

900
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,240
Heping,

901
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,880
I heard your son is back.

902
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,600
Yeah.

903
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,400
He's sitting right here.

904
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,160
Hello, Mrs. He, Mrs. Qian.

905
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,080
Little Ling Xiao

906
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,480
has grown up.

907
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,920
I can't recognize you if I meet you on the street.

908
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,640
He's getting

909
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,120
more and more handsome.

910
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,440
Handsome?

911
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,700
I think he's ordinary.

912
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,560
Ordinary?

913
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,800
Ling Xiao is a doctor.

914
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,280
It's a good job occupation.

915
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,680
Girls must be

916
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,840
crazy about him.

917
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,640
Yeah.

918
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,960
Ling Xiao, do you have a girlfriend?

919
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,560
Not yet.

920
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,920
Ling Xiao, will you leave again?

921
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,640
No.

922
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,280
I've got a job here.

923
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,560
Well.

924
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,960
How's your mom lately?

925
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,520
Has she fully recovered?

926
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,040
Not really.

927
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,120
After all, she was so paralyzed before.

928
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,160
But she's strong-willed.

929
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,720
After these years of rehabilitation therapy

930
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,920
and training, she has got better.

931
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,840
She can only use one leg now.

932
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,040
She can't walk easily,

933
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,840
and it hurts when she walks a lot.

934
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,320
But she can

935
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,040
do basic things in life

936
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,440
such buying and cooking.

937
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,280
You really had a hard time.

938
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
Yeah. It was hard for him.

939
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,200
But it's good you're back.

940
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,640
Thank you.

941
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,720
Thank you. Thank you.

942
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,640
Haichao is so lucky.

943
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,880
His sons are filial to him.

944
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,800
Both his two sons have come back.

945
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,960
And Heping is luckier.

946
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,000
It's easy for you

947
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,280
to raise kids.

948
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah.

949
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,720
It's attributed to Haichao.

950
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,640
He's careful and better at teaching kids.

951
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,800
Of course.

952
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,180
Here come the noodles.

953
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,920
Okay.

954
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,160
Thanks.

955
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,080
Haichao,

956
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,080
where's Ziqiu?

957
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,410
He doesn't live at home.

958
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,560
He lives opposite Jianjian.

959
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,920
Ling Xiao is

960
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,320
about to move there.

961
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
When the kids are back,

962
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,280
they just want to be close to each other.

963
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,640
In my opinion,

964
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
you may pick one of your sons

965
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,720
as Jianjian's husband.

966
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,720
Keep the goodie

967
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,960
within the family.

968
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,000
Ling Xiao, what do you say?

969
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,720
Well, I'll work hard.

970
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,720
Work hard. Work hard.

971
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,320
Work hard. Work hard.
