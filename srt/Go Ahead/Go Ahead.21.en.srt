00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,860
Episode 21

4
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
Let's interview Ling Xiao

5
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,620
while Mingyue is away.

6
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,360
Mingyue is attractive,

7
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,800
generous and virtuous.

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,660
How long have you coveted her?

9
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
Coveted her?

10
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,920
A flirtatious "are-they, aren't-they" relationship may be quite fun,

11
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,800
but being in love

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,060
is much cooler, right?

13
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,560
Since Mingyue has told you how she feels,

14
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,760
you should take this chance immediately.

15
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,840
"Are-they, aren't-they"?

16
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
One second.

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,360
Mingyue told you?

18
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,640
She said she would

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,360
keep their current relationship for a while.

20
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,840
You knew

21
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,700
that Mingyue liked Ling Xiao too?

22
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,160
Known for ages.

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,480
I want to make it clear

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,880
that there is already someone I like.

25
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,640
Mingyue is

26
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,970
the one you like, right?

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,200
It's not her?

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,320
You said you like a girl

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,480
junior to you in high school?

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,480
My god!

31
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,480
Is it me?

32
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
One more second.

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
A girl junior to you in high school?

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Who is she?

35
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Why didn't I know?

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm finished.

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,380
You've finished your breakfast?

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,960
What's wrong with Li Jianjian now?

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,860
I think she's annoyed with Ling Xiao.

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,680
He agreed to come back

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,810
on the anniversary of Auntie's death.

42
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Who's that girl?

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,490
Who's that girl?

44
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
You are going to your studio?

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,480
Yes.

46
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,960
You're going to work?

47
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,570
Yeah, I'm going to work.

48
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
But it's Sunday today, isn't it?

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240
I have to keep working for seven consecutive days.

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,800
I see.

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,840
You go down first.

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,900
I forgot my mobile.

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
It's in your hand.

54
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,720
Ling Xiao...

55
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,320
Calm down, Ling Xiao.

56
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,120
Ling Xiao...

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,000
About what happened last night...

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
I got drunk last night,

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,540
so I don't remember anything.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

61
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,280
I didn't control myself.

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,520
But you know what I meant.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,460
You should think about it.

64
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,840
Think about what?

65
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
Snap out of it, Ling Xiao.

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,080
We're siblings,

67
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
not by blood, but closer than those that are.

68
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
We ate and slept together in the same house

69
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,240
since we were kids.

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,640
We're family.

71
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,120
That's not enough.

72
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,520
That's more than enough!

73
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
I want to set up

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,360
a family relationship

75
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
with Mr. Li and you

76
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,330
on a legal, public and moral basis.

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,890
Only if we get married in the future

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,380
can we be a real family.

79
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,520
Get married?

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,840
How could we possibly get married?

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,240
Break up with Zheng Shuran, OK?

82
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,520
I won't, and I won't marry you!

83
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,480
Hi?

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,280
Mingyue.

85
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,610
How many days will you stay at home?

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm not sure.

87
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,920
Nothing happened to your family, did it?

88
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,320
What else can I do for you?

89
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,520
Well, don't argue with your mom.

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,160
If she starts nagging,

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
just let it go in one ear and out the other.

92
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,320
Mom wants me to go grocery shopping,

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I'd better be going.

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
All right,

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,960
goodbye.

96
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,560
How about we go for Japanese tonight?

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,240
OK.

98
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Let's leave the stuff

99
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
in the studio.

100
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,280
We can have dinner and then watch a movie.

101
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,920
OK.

102
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm almost worn out

103
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,890
shopping for your clothes.

104
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,010
Let me carry you.

105
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,280
No need.

106
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
Someone might see us.

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
They won't.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,320
By the way,

109
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,520
take a box of thee MIHOO masks

110
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
back home tonight

111
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,160
to moisturize your skin.

112
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,290
Thank you, darling.

113
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Put me down, quick!

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,920
It's Sunday today.

115
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,120
What brings you here?

116
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm sorry for bothering you.

117
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,820
Don't you have a date with Shuran?

118
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,840
I just saw him a few days ago.

119
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,000
Come on, Jianjian,

120
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,789
you should spend every day together

121
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,480
when you're in love!

122
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
There's no need.

123
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,760
Haven't you heard of the Poem of Love

124
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,000
from the Department of Sculpture?

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
The Poem of Love?

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
What the hell is that?

127
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,400
Take a lump of clay,

128
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,200
make an image of you,

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,920
and an image of me.

130
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,760
Then smash

131
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,680
and crash them.

132
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,890
And then knead them together with a little water.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,520
And we'll remake an image of you

134
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
and an image of me out of the clay.

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
Thus in my clay, there's a little of you.

136
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
And in your clay, there's a little of me.

137
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,760
Ziqiu.

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,920
Why aren't there many customers again today?

139
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,520
Even so, you're not welcome.

140
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,420
Why have you still got it in for me?

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Why I've got it in for you?

142
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,640
Why I've got it in for you?

143
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,570
You're telling me you don't know?!

144
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
I...

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,040
I don't.

146
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,440
Every day, you date

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
different girls in my store,

148
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
talking about their breasts, hips and asses.

149
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,800
What do you think I...?

150
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Now girls all want

151
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
to be slim.

152
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,600
I just wanted to know

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
what girls actually though

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
about their own figures.

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
I want to break through

156
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,930
this fixed aesthetical idea with my new work.

157
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,600
You are so full it.

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
Always got some excuse.

159
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,560
I don't care,

160
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,720
but break up with Jianjian immediately,

161
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
or I'll come to your studio

162
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,760
and smash

163
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,880
all your statues.

164
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,730
Didn't Li Jianjian tell you

165
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
that we'd already broken up?

166
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,680
You've broken up?

167
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,200
Since she doesn't have any feelings for me,

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,160
so we broke up.

169
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,400
Right now,

170
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,200
We can go back to

171
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,040
being ordinary friends again,

172
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
and you can make a move for her as well.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,680
When I decide to make my move

174
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,080
is none of your business!

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,840
You've finally found out yourself.

176
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,770
What do you mean?

177
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
I noticed long ago,

178
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,920
that as Jianjian's elder brother,

179
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,800
you're always

180
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,680
following your sister about

181
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
instead of going after other girls.

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,560
Don't say anything stupid to Li Jianjian.

183
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,120
Get out!

184
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Be careful you don't scare Jianjian off

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,760
with your bad temper.

186
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,680
Get out!

187
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
Are you going to leave or not?

188
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,680
Why are you so sad about breaking up?

189
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
Just let it go.

190
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm not sad,

191
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,960
just depressed.

192
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
Getting dumped so soon

193
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,680
is really embarrassing.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,360
I still think

195
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
this is too hasty.

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
Really?

197
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Yeah.

198
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,200
I mean, look.

199
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
This isn't the right place,

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
and it's so hot here.

201
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
It'd be weird

202
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
kissing like this.

203
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,360
Weird?

204
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
The people are weird,

205
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,210
not the weather, right?

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,880
The people are weird too.

207
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Look, there seems to be...

208
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,610
Li Jianjian,

209
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,760
let's just be friends again.

210
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,520
Why?

211
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,960
We’re re better suited as friends..

212
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,600
Kissing each other

213
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,660
Would feel really strange for us.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
This is my first relationship.

215
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,720
It hasn't even lasted a month.

216
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,880
Less than a month?

217
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,120
You think you are in the postpartum period?

218
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,760
I don't think

219
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
we are in love,

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,080
just having fun together.

221
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,800
But we are having lots of fun.

222
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,330
Of course we're having lots of fun.

223
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,480
However, having fun together after we started going out

224
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,560
is different

225
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,280
from what we'd do

226
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,200
as friends.

227
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
Friends like doing other stuff,

228
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
but lovers like to stay together.

229
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,540
Look at you,

230
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,400
you look

231
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,930
completely unnatural now.

232
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
I don't.

233
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
So, do you understand the difference

234
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,760
between having fun together

235
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,520
and being together?

236
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,160
Got it...

237
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,240
I think.

238
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
This is my fault.

239
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,920
I suggested that we start dating,

240
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,480
so I should end it.

241
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,240
We should stop while we're ahead

242
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,280
and become good friends

243
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,240
that are inseparable and like-minded.

244
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,500
That's good, isn't it?

245
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,800
How about

246
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,450
you give me another chance?

247
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,040
No.

248
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,810
Try it. Close your eyes.

249
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,480
It's too late for that?

250
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,440
Now I smell nice

251
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,560
like a single guy.

252
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
Don't touch me.

253
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,920
No.

254
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,650
I'm drawing.

255
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,130
I'm drawing.

256
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,240
That's right.

257
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,000
I knew

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
you two would break up.

259
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,640
How?

260
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
I was serious about this.

261
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
It has nothing to do

262
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,920
with whether you're serious or not.

263
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,800
The two of you

264
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,360
didn't have that...

265
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,240
spark.

266
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,320
Spark?

267
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,960
Yeah.

268
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,200
First off,

269
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,360
when two people are dating

270
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
they care a lot about

271
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,480
their image with each other.

272
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,480
Look at me.

273
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,440
I put on an MIHOO mask

274
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
every day

275
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
to make my boyfriend

276
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
think my skin is nice

277
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,720
when he touches me.

278
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,440
Second,

279
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
when you're in a relationship,

280
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
you should spend time together every day.

281
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
You should keep in touch all the time

282
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,360
even though you've both gone back home.

283
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,840
As long as either of you

284
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,800
come into contact with other boys or girls,

285
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,930
you'll get jealous.

286
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,410
Do you two have that?

287
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
Yiran must have

288
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
realized this too.

289
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,040
A couple

290
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,680
might be nervous

291
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
about body contact between them,

292
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,240
but

293
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,360
they really look forward to it.

294
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,840
There's this kind of attraction

295
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,520
that makes both of your bodies

296
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,800
approach each other naturally.

297
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,800
There's no way

298
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,640
it will feel like disgust or rejection.

299
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,480
As long as he's with you,

300
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
you feel

301
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,640
safe and happy.

302
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
There's this kind of

303
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,080
great brimming

304
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
sense of

305
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
happiness.

306
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,410
That could be siblings too.

307
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,600
Did you think

308
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,080
I'm talking about ordinary body contact?

309
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,740
Like your brother kisses you?

310
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,520
Hey,

311
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,040
I thought you liked that Japanese TV series

312
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,720
about a romance

313
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,380
between unrelated siblings?

314
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Who ever said I liked that show?

315
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,240
I like Katayose Ryota.

316
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
Well, you said you would like

317
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,880
a boy like that

318
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,760
while you were watching the series.

319
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,680
Wait a second.

320
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I can understand

321
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,640
about every word you said,

322
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,560
but I don't have a clue

323
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,090
what you're talking about.

324
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,840
What do you mean by a romance between siblings?

325
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,500
And who's this Katayose Ryota

326
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,280
you mentioned?

327
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,160
Why are you laughing?

328
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Don't eat anything

329
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,160
within three hours.

330
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,520
You should eat mainly liquid food for the next couple of days.

331
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,400
You might not feel normal,

332
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,440
that's common.

333
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,800
OK, thank you, doctor.

334
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,320
You're welcome.

335
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,780
I'll get you your medicine, this way please.

336
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,520
Hello, who's speaking?

337
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,480
It's me.

338
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,480
Can't you buy

339
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,760
a new mobile?

340
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,200
Contacting you is so hard

341
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
and the calls get forwarded.

342
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
What do you want?

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
I've got some good news for you.

344
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,880
Li Jianjian

345
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,080
has broken up

346
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,810
with her so-called boyfriend.

347
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,920
Is that all?

348
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,760
Yes?

349
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,720
Goodbye.

350
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
I've brought you the new uniform

351
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,960
distributed by the hospital.

352
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,560
Thank you.

353
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Put it over there.

354
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,840
It's usual for a brother to dislike

355
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
his sister's boyfriend.

356
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
But you and your brother

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
make your dislike

358
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
a little bit too obvious.

359
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,530
It's ex-boyfriend now.

360
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
How about having lunch together?

361
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll take you to a restaurant

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
with really good food.

363
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,480
Miss Feng.

364
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,760
I've told the girl I like

365
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,890
how I feel about her.

366
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
That soon?

367
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,930
Did she return the feeling?

368
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,720
No.

369
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,440
She's been used to our current relationship for too long,

370
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,000
so it will take her some time

371
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,010
to accept a transition to another.

372
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,680
Is it Qi Mingyue?

373
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,960
No.

374
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I don't know her?

375
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,560
You know her.

376
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,370
You bought her an ice cream.

377
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Gosh, your sister?

378
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,890
His childhood friend and two grades younger.

379
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm so stupid!

380
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,360
Miss Feng.

381
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,840
Don't call me Miss Feng.

382
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,160
Heavens,

383
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,880
who is this poor girl

384
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,880
sitting here

385
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
all alone?

386
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,760
Sorry, we're not open today.

387
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,589
Why don't you go back home?

388
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,200
I don't want to go home alone?

389
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,040
What, is there a ghost in your house?

390
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,100
Why don't you go and see your brother?

391
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,880
I'd rather see a ghost.

392
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
The two of you have fallen out again?

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Which brother have you fallen out with?

394
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
Look at you,

395
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
why are you always fighting with your brothers?

396
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,810
I'm fighting with them?

397
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,720
I thought you hated them?

398
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
I decided to forgive them again

399
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
because of your generosity.

400
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,240
How can I an outsider like me

401
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,300
stop you guys from getting together?

402
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,280
Besides,

403
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
your two brothers

404
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,200
both basically

405
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,520
dote on you.

406
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,560
What have I got to complain about them?

407
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,800
If you've been fighting,

408
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,040
it'll be because you're spoilt.

409
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,200
You...

410
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,200
you’re being the opposite

411
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,760
too biased now.

412
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm just being fair and just.

413
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Don't take what you've got for granted.

414
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,400
Come on, I'll walk you home.

415
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,240
You really want to go after Li Jianjian?

416
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,320
Finally, you can confront

417
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,400
the filthy desires of your mind.

418
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,480
You're the filthy one.

419
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
It is...

420
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,640
It is convenient for me to take care of her.

421
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,800
Don't be shy.

422
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,600
I always thought

423
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,120
you suffered from developmental retardation.

424
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,840
So you do like her.

425
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,840
The two of you grew up together, didn't you?

426
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,960
We haven't met for nine years,

427
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,040
OK?

428
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,360
Besides, how could I know...

429
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,520
How could I know

430
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,850
that this is what my feelings for her were?

431
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,840
I suppose.

432
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,280
After all, boundaries are good.

433
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
You know, she was a little girl

434
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,080
when I met her.

435
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,810
Just like that, she's grown up.

436
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,900
You are positioned perfectly

437
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,840
to marry into her family.

438
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
Cut the crap!

439
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,480
I didn't invite you to dinner

440
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,810
so you could laugh at me.

441
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,240
I'm not laughing at you.

442
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
I'm really happy for you.

443
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
What's that old saying?

444
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,080
Finally, my son has grown up.

445
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,480
That's how a father feels, you know?

446
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
You are taking advantage of me, aren't you?

447
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,760
I'm your dad.

448
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,760
How are you going to win her over?

449
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,920
If I knew,

450
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,780
I wouldn't have needed to invite you out for dinner.

451
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
No wonder you've been so generous today

452
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
and invited me to such a posh street-side restaurant.

453
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,680
It turns out you need my help.

454
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,760
Waitress,

455
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,320
I'd like a dozen oysters and two large grilled kidneys.

456
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,440
OK, just a minute.

457
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,680
Don't go overboard?

458
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,120
Tell me

459
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,780
what are you thinking.

460
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,640
I just think

461
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,200
that if Li Jianjian and I get married,

462
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
then we'll both

463
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,240
have the same household register.

464
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
I mean, if Li Jianjian and I

465
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
have an emotional foundation like that,

466
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
then won't things

467
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,480
be easier for us?

468
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,880
I can't help thinking

469
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,080
that this emotional foundation

470
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,680
would actually be a barrier.

471
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,080
What if she only thinks of you

472
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,280
as her elder brother?

473
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,960
Do you think

474
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,040
the fact that I like Li Jianjian

475
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,320
is perverted?

476
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't laugh!

477
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
All right, I won't laugh.

478
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
Are you still the person I know?

479
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,160
You come you're suddenly so pure

480
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,440
when it comes to feelings.

481
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,160
Shut up.

482
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
All right.

483
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think

484
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,240
you should at least make her believe

485
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,680
that you are a normal man.

486
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,040
Don't I look like a normal man?

487
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,920
I mean gender awareness.

488
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,040
You should show

489
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,480
your charm as a man,

490
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
not an elder brother who only know how to cook

491
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,300
and shop for handbags.

492
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,000
Moreover,

493
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for love to develop,

494
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,320
it needs a little mystery.

495
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,320
I mean, you know each other so well,

496
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,000
so I think you should

497
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
take the initiative

498
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,480
and break up that atmosphere.

499
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,280
Let Li Jianjian become aware

500
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,840
that the kind of relationship you two have

501
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
could possible develop in a different way.

502
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,680
Break up the atmosphere?

503
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,360
How do I do that?

504
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,560
I'd like some kebabs.

505
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,800
You've got hands, haven't you?!

506
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,000
I'd like some kebabs.

507
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
Here, they're all yours.

508
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,370
Come on, help yourself.

509
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,960
You should

510
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,960
do something off the wall.

511
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,080
Like...

512
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,200
Get lost!

513
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,160
What a crappy idea!

514
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,890
Finish your dinner and get out!

515
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,400
So...

516
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,080
have you met Zhuang Bei's ex-girlfriend before?

517
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,160
Which ex-girlfriend do you mean?

518
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Has he had lots?

519
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Not many,

520
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,440
just a few.

521
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,840
What types?

522
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
All types.

523
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,770
How about a type like me?

524
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,840
A type like you

525
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,160
could get anyone.

526
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
You don't understand.

527
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,400
Sometimes the more beautiful a girl looks,

528
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,120
the fewer boys there are making a move for her.

529
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,200
Because they all think

530
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,260
there must be loads of boys after her.

531
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,920
Just tell Zhuang Bei

532
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,440
that no one is after you.

533
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
You'll always be getting dumped

534
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
if you approach your relationships

535
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,960
in such a straightforward manner.

536
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Understand?

537
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,660
Where's Jianjian?

538
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Jianjian,

539
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,450
don't forget your re-examination tomorrow.

540
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
Miss Feng told me

541
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
that I don't need the re-examination

542
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,860
if there's nothing wrong with me.

543
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,240
He was only one day late

544
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,360
for the commemoration of your mom's death.

545
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,160
You've held a grudge for so long?

546
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,560
Ling Xiao has a serious anxiety disorder,

547
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,320
what if he...?

548
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,920
That's nothing to do with me!

549
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,600
All right,

550
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,730
it's definitely nothing to do with me.

551
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,280
Do you

552
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,320
need me

553
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
to accompany

554
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,240
your mother?

555
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,600
Damn it!

556
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,210
I must have owed him in a previous life!

557
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,920
Playing mahjong!

558
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,840
The formal employee recruitment

559
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
I asked you to help me about

560
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
was pretty helpful for my cousin.

561
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,560
I'd like to invite you to dinner

562
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,440
if you are free.

563
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,560
You...

564
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,330
Why are you standing there?

565
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,810
Why are you sneaking about in here?

566
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,640
Yesterday I put half a watermelon

567
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
in the fridge.

568
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,120
Come on.

569
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,560
Ling Xiao,

570
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,730
I've been thinking about this all day.

571
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,280
So you've decided?

572
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,720
Yes.

573
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
We lived and grew up together

574
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
from childhood,

575
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,000
so the basis of our relationship

576
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
is super close,

577
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,440
even closer than blood relatives.

578
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,160
No, there you can't even compare the two.

579
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,440
So I think you might

580
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,500
have mixed family kinship with love.

581
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not like you.

582
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,760
He was clearly just a friend,

583
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,490
but you insisted on dating him.

584
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,690
I'm talking about you, don't get me involved.

585
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,760
No.

586
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,200
Think about it,

587
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
you've been living

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,380
with your mother these years,

589
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,640
so you might feel

590
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,520
a little guilty toward me

591
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,760
in your mind.

592
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,440
Then you came back

593
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,040
to Singapore.

594
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,000
Did

595
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,600
something happen to provoke you

596
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,360
and suddenly make you

597
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,560
think you like me?

598
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,760
Besides, you have an anxiety disorder.

599
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,960
Is it because...?

600
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,290
When I was in my senior year in high school,

601
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,800
I told you

602
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,450
I would marry you in the future.

603
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,960
Well, that was just a joke.

604
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,450
Since then, I've made up my mind

605
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,560
that I'll leave you

606
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,280
the watermelon core right in the middle,

607
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,160
the rice crust at the bottom of the rice cooker,

608
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,890
the meat on both gills of a fish,

609
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
the marrow in the marrowbone

610
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,100
and the stuffing in steamed buns.

611
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,640
You took me into your house when we were children,

612
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
so I'm all yours

613
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,280
for my whole life.

614
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,140
Is it sweet?

615
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,900
You've finished talking?

616
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,320
I must have owed him in my previous life!

617
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,920
What's wrong?

618
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,860
Hello, Uncle Ling.

619
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,100
Where's Mr. Li?

620
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,440
Uncle Ling wants to see you, Uncle Li.

621
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,320
Haichao.

622
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,000
Wait a second,

623
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,240
I'll be finished soon.

624
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,000
It won't take long,

625
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,520
and I have to go on duty

626
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,780
at the police station.

627
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,440
Come on.

628
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,560
What's up?

629
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,720
You asked me to find He Mei,

630
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,880
didn't you?

631
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
I thought it might be difficult to find her,

632
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,980
but a friend of mine told me

633
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,640
that she's already back.

634
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,360
She's been back for two years,

635
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,290
and she's running a beauty parlor.

636
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,120
I wonder

637
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,940
how can she do this as a mother.

638
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
Having been back for two years,

639
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,480
she even doesn't visit you

640
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,940
and ask how Ziqiu is doing.

641
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,720
I'll send her address

642
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,920
to your mobile later.

643
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Goodbye.

644
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,120
She's back?

645
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,280
Li Jianjian

646
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,610
loves eating junk food.

647
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,760
She must have gone

648
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,960
to eat the fried rice cake with brown sugar.

649
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,020
You've spoiled her

650
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
by making her cakes all the time.

651
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,810
I've reduced the sugar for her, OK?

652
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,680
I saw you were awake again

653
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,720
when I woke up to go to the toilet last night.

654
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,480
Something happened

655
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,280
when you went back to Singapore?

656
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
Why do Li Jianjian and you

657
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,960
think that something happened to me?

658
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,600
Because we know your mom very well.

659
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,480
You know, we couldn't contact you

660
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,640
because you broke your mobile.

661
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,720
And you had a ticket back

662
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,040
but still didn't make it.

663
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,520
Anyway we think

664
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,560
it must have been difficult for you returning this time.

665
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,000
So what on earth

666
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,260
did you say to your mom?

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
I don't know.

668
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,000
At first, she couldn't accept it,

669
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,680
but later, she agreed

670
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,920
that I could come back.

671
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,380
She just agreed like that?

672
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,320
Surely your mom didn't commit suicide

673
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,600
once you were back?

674
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,760
Your mom committed suicide.

675
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,200
She did not,

676
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
she's still very much alive.

677
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,970
You've met your mom?

678
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,280
No.

679
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,480
I mean

680
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,320
she has a tenacious vitality,

681
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,960
you know?

682
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,920
She always lives very well

683
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,180
wherever she resides.

684
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
I wonder

685
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
where your mom is.

686
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
Maybe she has married

687
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,360
and given birth to a younger brother or sister for you.

688
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,560
Hello.

689
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,480
Hello.

690
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,920
Sir,

691
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,780
no male guests are received here.

692
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm not here for a beauty service.

693
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,960
I'd like to ask

694
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,160
if your boss is He Mei.

695
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,960
Yes,

696
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,520
but our boss is not here yet.

697
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,450
This gentleman wants to meet you, Mrs. He.

698
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,960
I never thought that you would come and find me.

699
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,600
How old is your son?

700
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,360
Four,

701
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,960
and he's in kindergarten now.

702
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Four,

703
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,400
he's cute at this age.

704
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,680
You know, after you came back,

705
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,340
and opened a kindergarten...

706
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,920
I mean a beauty parlor.

707
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,600
You didn't

708
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
even tell me.

709
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,440
I didn't think it was necessary,

710
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,080
and we weren't in any kind of relationship.

711
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,400
I know

712
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,000
I might have disturbed your life

713
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,760
coming to meet you

714
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
all of a sudden like this,

715
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,080
but I just wanted to tell you

716
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,020
that Ziqiu is back from abroad

717
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,020
and will stay here.

718
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,160
Besides, he's running a cafe

719
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,560
and business is booming.

720
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,600
You haven't met him,

721
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,880
but he's a grown-up now.

722
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,320
And...

723
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,480
he's as tall as I am,

724
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,720
and he's very skilled

725
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,480
in getting along with people.

726
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,540
Congratulations.

727
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,760
I didn't tell him

728
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,760
about your return last time.

729
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
I'm here this time

730
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,200
to discuss

731
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,520
whether I can tell him

732
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,050
about your repayment to me.

733
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,600
Whatever,

734
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,360
it's up to you.

735
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,840
Is that all?

736
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,960
Well, He Mei...

737
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,710
I know you still care about Ziqiu

738
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,120
in your heart,

739
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,320
and you left him

740
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,520
because you had your own difficulties.

741
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,320
Also, what happened in the past

742
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,600
still haunts his mind,

743
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,840
but he never says anything.

744
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
I just want

745
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,330
to help him get over this psychological scar.

746
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,320
How about

747
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,120
you consider

748
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,840
meeting him?

749
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
Li Haichao,

750
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,800
you act like a nice guy

751
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
in a morbid manner.

752
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,960
If it were someone else,

753
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,580
he might earnestly expect me to die outside.

754
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,600
I...

755
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,480
what I did was for Ziqiu.

756
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,210
What you did was for your child too.

757
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,600
Li Haichao,

758
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,520
I suggest you

759
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,920
not take anyone else

760
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,000
as a goody-goody

761
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,840
like you.

762
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,240
I left Ziqiu

763
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,920
for my own sake,

764
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
and I'm back

765
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,960
for my own sake too.

766
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,480
If we meet on the street in the future,

767
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,810
let's act as strangers.

768
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,000
He Mei.

769
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,320
Wait!

770
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,320
Drive faster, please.

771
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
Are you in a hurry?

772
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,040
Yes.

773
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,480
Don't turn around.

774
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,100
Don't turn around.

775
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,840
Boss,

776
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,200
our Arabica coffee beans

777
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
are running out,

778
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,200
and we need to prepare

779
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,120
more dripping coffee

780
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,650
of some other kinds as well.

781
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,520
OK, I got it.

782
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
A power cut?

783
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,080
There must be no power in the power card.

784
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,720
Where's the spare power card?

785
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
In the drawer, down the cash register.

786
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
Get it here and charge it with power.

787
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,360
Is it a power cut?

788
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,600
Possibly.

789
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,200
Use this spare card for charging.

790
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,720
OK.

791
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,120
Ziqiu.

792
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,360
There you are.

793
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,680
Why don't you

794
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,160
come to the kitchen for me?

795
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,080
Get on with your work, and leave us alone.

796
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,680
All right,

797
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,720
just tell them

798
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,280
what you would like

799
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,960
to eat and drink,

800
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
and ask them to make the food for you.

801
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,120
I have a cake

802
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,800
baking in the oven,

803
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,560
so I'm going to work.

804
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,760
OK, thank you, Ziqiu.

805
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,770
You are welcome.

806
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,360
Why does Ziqiu

807
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,840
become kind to you?

808
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Based on you,

809
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,040
we have come down

810
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,200
to good friends,

811
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,440
so of course he's kind to me.

812
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,440
You told him

813
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
we've broken up?

814
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,380
Well, you didn't tell him?

815
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,040
It is less than a month

816
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,120
before I got dumped.

817
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,680
How embarrassing it is!

818
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,480
I was supposed

819
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,600
to find a proper chance

820
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,480
to tell them

821
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,680
that we are not suited

822
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
for one another, but you...

823
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,200
You are quite a vainglorious,

824
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,320
little girl.

825
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,720
I just feel embarrassed.

826
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,540
That was my first love.

827
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,280
Stop it,

828
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
we didn't do anything

829
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,760
that should be done in a relationship.

830
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,120
Our relationship in the past is valid,

831
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,000
otherwise

832
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,860
I would feel embarrassed.

833
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You've entirely denied me.

834
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,200
Or else?

835
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,080
You see,

836
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,400
is there any difference

837
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,640
between what we are doing now

838
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,770
and what we did together in the so-called relationship?

839
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,560
You are right.

840
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,560
Of course.

841
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,560
Ziqiu.

842
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm decorating the cake with cream.

843
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,440
Come here.

844
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,040
Would you like to try this?

845
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,840
I don't know how to do this.

846
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,000
No matter, I can teach you.

847
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,560
Come on.

848
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,640
You see,

849
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,400
hold this pastry bag with your right hand.

850
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,800
This is used for squeezing the cream out.

851
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,560
Easy, easy.

852
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,200
Support it

853
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,360
with your left hand.

854
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,120
You got that reversed.

855
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,200
Yeah, this way.

856
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,640
Squeeze the bag,

857
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,200
and drag it outwards.

858
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,200
One more.

859
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,400
Ziqiu.

860
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,920
Yes.

861
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,460
Did Ling Xiao tell you about that?

862
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,400
What?

863
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
About what he said to his mom.

864
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,560
Yes.

865
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
He said she couldn't accept it at first,

866
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,680
but was suddenly convinced.

867
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,600
That's impossible.

868
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,920
According to what I know about Aunt Chen Ting,

869
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,560
she's the kind of person

870
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
who is bound to achieve her own aims.

871
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,760
Did something

872
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,280
provoke Ling Xiao again?

873
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,210
Why don't you ask him yourself?

874
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
We are talking about this.

875
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,880
Besides, since you are boys

876
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,640
and live together,

877
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,770
you are sure to talk about everything.

878
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,800
You've been closest

879
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,520
to Ling Xiao since your childhood, right?

880
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,640
You keep saying Ling Xiao every day.

881
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,920
No, absolutely not.

882
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,040
I give equal treatment

883
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,840
to both of you.

884
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,680
Really?

885
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,400
Yes.

886
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,960
When I just came to your family in my childhood,

887
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,160
you always crammed my belongings

888
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,120
into a suitcase

889
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,440
and pushed it down

890
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,760
from the high slope

891
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,240
at the gate of the community

892
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,560
while Dad and I were away.

893
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,720
However, Ling Xiao

894
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,120
dropped the walnuts

895
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,480
you picked downstairs,

896
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,340
but you weren't angry about that.

897
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,520
You still remember

898
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,980
what happened in the past.

899
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,160
Anyway,

900
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,220
you've been fond of Ling Xiao since your childhood.

901
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,440
Well, that's mainly because

902
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,680
Aunt Chen Ting

903
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,120
didn't become my stepmother,

904
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,000
but Aunt He Mei

905
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,720
almost did.

906
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,240
That's enough.

907
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,480
Oops!

908
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,240
Gosh!

909
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,800
Come on, Ziqiu, do something.

910
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,480
It's my fault.

911
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,600
Save it quickly.

912
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,200
I can't save it.

913
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,860
I have to spread the cream all over again.

914
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,720
All right,

915
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,740
I'll spread the cream all over again.

916
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,880
Well, let me bring this cake

917
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,720
back home, OK?

918
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,240
Today I'll live in Dad's house.

919
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,840
You'll live in Dad's house?

920
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,280
Yes.

921
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,280
What's up?

922
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,360
I just want to accompany him.

923
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,800
All right,

924
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,640
I'll go back and live in Dad's home too.

925
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,120
I have something to discuss with him.

926
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,920
You can take this cake back,

927
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,040
on the way,

928
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,160
and I needn't come back here again.

929
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,760
Yiran and I will go to see

930
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,120
a painting exhibition later.

931
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,680
OK.

932
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,600
By the way,

933
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,440
drink more water,

934
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
or you might catch heatstroke.

935
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,520
Got it.
