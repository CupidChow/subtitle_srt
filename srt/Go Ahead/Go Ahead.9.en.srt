[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,860
Episode 9

4
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Well, it's my mom.

5
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Hello?

6
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,010
In the intensive care unit.

7
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,570
The doctor said it was not optimistic.

8
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,640
Dad, uncle and I are here.

9
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
Aunt went to the train station to pick up my cousin.

10
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,520
She has asked for leave from school and she's on her way here.

11
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,640
That's all.

12
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Mom, don't cry.

13
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Don't cry.

14
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,960
We'll talk when you get here.

15
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
Why hasn't your mom arrived?

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,080
Didn't her plane get here at 8:00 a.m.?

17
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,480
It's about 1:00 p.m. now.

18
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
Hurry her up.

19
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
I've called,

20
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,410
but no one answered.

21
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
Is your grandma OK?

22
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
She's really dying.

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,040
Hello?

24
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,720
Brother!

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,520
What's up

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
Hello, is that Ling Xiao?

27
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,680
This is Chengzi's uncle.

28
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Here is the thing.

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,900
Please be prepared.

30
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,020
My brother and his wife

31
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,020
had a car accident

32
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,140
on their way to the airport,

33
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,740
and they're in hospital now.

34
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,520
The situation is not good.

35
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,640
Mom is dying!

36
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Ling Xiao!

37
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,240
Ling Xiao!

38
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,840
Hurry up!

39
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,680
Mom!

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,390
Doctor!

41
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,800
Mom!

42
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,800
Mom! Mom! Mom!

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,960
Grandma! Grandma!

44
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,320
Mom!

45
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,160
Grandma!

46
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
Dad, you're back.

47
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,159
Yes.

48
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
Get me

49
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
some bezoar antidotal tablets.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,460
I've got some oral ulcers.

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,460
Dad, what's wrong with your eyes?

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
My eyelid has been twitching the whole morning.

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,280
It's annoying.

54
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,610
And even the tape can't stop it.

55
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
Dad,

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
please take good care of your body.

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,680
Don't worry too much

58
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
when something comes up.

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
Now I'm about

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,080
to go to college

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,840
and I can't be here for you.

62
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,120
Please be healthy,

63
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,170
or I'll worry about you.

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,920
You do take after me.

65
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,200
You worry a lot.

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
When you're away from home,

67
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,500
I'll be much relieved.

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,640
I'm fine.

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,560
When our noodle restaurant becomes bigger,

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,880
I'll be much busier.

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Then I'll

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640
hire someone.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,440
By then, I'll just sit there

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
and do nothing.

75
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
I'll snack on sunflower seeds,

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,690
play mahjong

77
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,460
and enjoy a happy life!

78
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,100
Dad, you're just saying that.

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,020
It's from Mr. Ling.

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,659
Hello, Heping.

81
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,740
How is it going over there?

82
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,810
It's 11:30 p.m. now.

83
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,440
You still have to go to school tomorrow.

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Now go to bed.

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
OK.

86
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,600
Mr. Ling!

87
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,720
You startled me!

88
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Where is Xiao?

89
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,420
He went to the countryside with them.

90
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Why are you still up at such late hours?

91
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,520
Go and

92
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,780
get me a glass of water.

93
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Sit down.

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,000
OK.

95
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,600
How is it?

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,360
How is Chen Ting?

97
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
Her husband

98
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
died instantly.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
Chen Ting is badly injured

100
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,610
and they're trying to save her.

101
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
Her husband's family

102
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
asked the family members here

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
to get a visa quickly.

104
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,200
This afternoon,

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,520
I took Ling Xiao and his uncle

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,720
to apply for a visa.

107
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,000
It will take at least a few days even if it's urgent.

108
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
So

109
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
we'll hold a funeral for Xiao's grandma

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,680
in the following days.

111
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
The established practices in their hometown

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,130
are quite complicated.

113
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,170
Can Ling Xiao handle

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,159
so many things?

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
He has grown up

116
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,000
and he has to

117
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
handle it

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,460
no matter what.

119
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,680
How did it happen?

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,600
He drove

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
too fast.

Haichao,

136
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
I made it on my own.

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,560
It has honeysuckle, emblica officindlis gaertn,

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
chrysanthemum morifolium, jasmine

139
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,240
and West Lake Longjing tea

140
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,120
that my daughter

141
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,180
just bought for me.

142
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,240
Recently, your eyes

143
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
have turn red.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,280
Drink it for a few days

145
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,960
and you'll get better.

146
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Thank you.

147
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,320
I don't feel so well

148
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,720
these days.

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,130
I'm still having the ulcers

150
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,640
and I can't even eat

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,720
the green bean soup

152
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,180
that Jianjian made for me.

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,440
Come.

154
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,640
Please have some fruits.

155
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
Please have some fruits.

156
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,410
-OK. -Thank you.

157
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,160
Ziqiu,

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
go and make a cup for your dad.

159
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,680
OK.

160
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Thank you very much.

161
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,280
Thank you

162
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,520
for coming to see me.

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,960
We're

164
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
just fine.

165
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,320
We work in the neighborhood committee

166
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,370
and it's our duty

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,920
to show loving care

168
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
for every household.

169
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,360
How miserable it is!

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
Mrs. Chen

171
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,400
was not very old,

172
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,480
but she was an old person,

173
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,280
but Chen Ting is still young

174
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,760
and her daughter is still so little.

175
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
If she can't make it,

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,090
it'll be such a pity.

177
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,530
But there's nothing we can do about it.

178
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,160
People die when it's time.

179
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,600
And it's

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
all predestined.

181
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,840
Well,

182
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,440
it's so hard

183
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
for Ling Xiao.

184
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,720
Yes.

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,600
By the way,

186
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,860
has he gone over there?

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,680
Yes.

188
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,520
He went over there with his uncle

189
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
from his grandma's home yesterday.

190
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
In all of these years,

191
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,740
Chen Ting has never taken care of him,

192
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,360
but when something is up,

193
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,840
Ling Xiao will still

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,290
take care of his mother.

195
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,360
And Ziqiu's mother,

196
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,680
if something happens to her in the future,

197
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,140
she will come to Ziqiu too.

198
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
Have some tea, please.

199
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
OK. OK.

200
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,640
Good one!

201
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,130
How is it going with you?

202
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
Not bad.

203
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,720
My goal is Wuhan University,

204
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,440
but if the admission score is the same as last year,

205
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
I might fail

206
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,530
and I'll consider other colleges.

207
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,980
What about you?

208
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,370
I don't know.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,900
I haven't asked Ling Xiao yet.

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,560
It's fine.

211
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,120
As long as you two

212
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,360
are in the same city.

213
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,840
What do you say

214
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
if I study abroad

215
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
and take a year of preparatory course?

216
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,840
I completely agree!

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
Would you go

218
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,080
if you were me?

219
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
If I were you, I would definitely go.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Why should I make it easy for him?

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
It's not easy for my parents to support me.

222
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
My parents won't have to pay for it,

223
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,680
if someone else will.

224
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,970
They can spend the money on improving their life.

225
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
As for me,

226
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,080
my heart will always be with them.

227
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,080
And when I complete my studies,

228
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,010
I will come back.

229
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,880
You're right.

230
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,760
My dad

231
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,280
has a motto.

232
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,040
There's no need

233
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,170
to take the hard way.

234
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,180
Think about it.

235
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,800
Really.

236
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,000
Right now, I just feel

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,280
that life is hard.

238
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,570
What do you mean?

239
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,320
It means

240
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
that when you think things will go bad,

241
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
it will go bad.

242
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,080
You're just

243
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,720
affected by

244
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,320
what happened

245
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,080
to Ling Xiao.

246
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,080
But what happened to them

247
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,340
is very rare after all.

248
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,100
I think what happened to you is very rare.

249
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,560
Your life has been smooth since your childhood,

250
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,720
so you can be so positive

251
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,450
about everything in your life.

252
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
It can't be helped.

253
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,640
I'm just so lucky.

254
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,650
Well, lucky one,

255
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
let's continue playing.

256
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,360
Ma'am,

257
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,130
my condolences.

258
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,490
Grandma Qin,

259
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,170
my condolences.

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,160
Thank you.

261
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,880
Ling Xiao,

262
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,920
your mother is still in the intensive care unit

263
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,730
and she's not out of danger yet.

264
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,210
You have to stay strong.

265
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
You have to believe

266
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,080
that she will wake up.

267
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,200
I've taken care

268
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,560
of my son's funeral

269
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,890
and I'm going back to Malaysia.

270
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,800
Chengzi's grandpa

271
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,160
is in such poor health

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,620
that he can't move freely,

273
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,970
so I have to go back and take care of him.

274
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
Chengzi

275
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,060
is going to have a vacation

276
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,530
and I don't want her to attend school here.

277
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,520
I want her to go back home with me so I can take care of her.

278
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,960
I don't want to go to Malaysia!

279
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,680
I want to be with my brother!

280
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,320
Chengzi,

281
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
listen to me!

282
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,330
No one can take care of you here.

283
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,360
I don't care!

284
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
I don't want to leave my brother!

285
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,200
I want to be here with my brother

286
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,120
to wait for mom to wake up!

287
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,380
Chengzi, listen to me.

288
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,740
Sorry, it's a work phone call.

289
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,800
Hello?

290
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,000
Chengzi,

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,960
be good.

292
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Let go.

293
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,180
Just let her stay here.

294
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
When mom wakes up,

295
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,820
she'll want to see her instantly.

296
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,200
Come on.

297
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,600
Pull yourself together.

298
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,960
It has been more than 10 days

299
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,760
since I saw Xiao last time

300
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,420
when his grandma passed away.

301
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
He didn't answer the phone

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
when I called him yesterday.

303
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,730
He must be having a hard time right now.

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,320
I feel so sorry for him.

305
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,720
Hello?

306
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,720
Qi Mingyue.

307
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,280
Where are you?

308
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,560
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

309
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,589
I'm sorry, Miss.

310
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,849
He's my elder brother.

311
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
What happened?

312
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,680
Well,

313
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,109
someone pushed her down

314
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,480
from the stairs.

315
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,520
Yes.

316
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,160
I don't know who pushed me.

317
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,880
There were so many people during the break.

318
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
I rolled down directly

319
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,920
from the third floor

320
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
of our teaching building.

321
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,760
Yes.

322
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,640
Don't move. Don't move.

323
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,640
Miss, please be gentle.

324
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Please be gentle.

325
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,680
You're so badly injured.

326
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
It has to be disinfected properly,

327
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,020
or it will leave a scar.

328
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,120
It hurts!

329
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm going to make a phone call.

330
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,690
Did you do it?

331
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
What happened now?

332
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Someone pushed Li Jianjian

333
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,440
down from the stairs.

334
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,640
Did you do it?

335
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,480
What's wrong

336
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,800
with you?

337
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,880
Do you mean

338
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
if anything bad

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,920
happens to her,

340
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,520
it'll be

341
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,650
all my fault?

342
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,320
The results will be released in these days,

343
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
so how did it go?

344
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,720
I'm fine.

345
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,180
I can walk on my own, Ziqiu.

346
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,280
Don't move!

347
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
Or it might split!

348
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,120
What's up?

349
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,440
I miss Xiao.

350
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
I thought it would be easy.

351
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,480
It has been just about ten days since I saw him last time,

352
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
but I'm so in the blues.

353
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,200
You say,

354
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,060
when you go to college in Beijing,

355
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,960
I won't be able

356
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,760
to see you for months.

357
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,290
I will miss you guys so much.

358
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
It'll be fine.

359
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,640
You'll get used to it.

360
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,840
Besides,

361
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,840
we can call each other every day.

362
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
Every day?

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,520
Yes.

364
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,280
No matter where I am,

365
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,680
I will call you every day.

366
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,010
I don't believe you.

367
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
It's said

368
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,840
that when boys go to college,

369
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,560
they will chase

370
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,800
after girls every day

371
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,120
and when they're in love,

372
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,850
they'll be totally different.

373
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,000
That's impossible.

374
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Who told you that?

375
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,280
Young man,

376
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,000
you'll see.

377
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,440
OK. Let's wait and see.

378
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
What's going on?

379
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,800
Mrs. Fang.

380
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,520
Jianjian, Ziqiu,

381
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,200
hurry up!

382
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,680
That,

383
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,120
that ambulance is going to the Third Hospital

384
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,440
and your father is on it.

385
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
What happened to my dad?

386
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,240
He passed out.

387
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,960
Somehow,

388
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,840
he just fainted.

389
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,760
Hurry up!

390
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Could it be a cerebral infarction?

391
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,280
It can't be.

392
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,760
I don't know.

393
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,640
I'll take you to the hospital now.

394
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,200
Go now.

395
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,960
Let's go.

396
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Let's take a taxi.

397
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,440
Dad!

398
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,360
Be quiet.

399
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,560
Keep your voice down.

400
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,560
Where is my dad?

401
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,400
He's here.

402
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,440
Dad!

403
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Dad!

404
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,000
Dad!

405
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,000
What happened to my dad?

406
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,600
There's nothing serious

407
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
with your father.

408
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,000
He's just over exhausted

409
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,800
without a good rest,

410
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
and he's a little malnourished.

411
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,400
Dad!

412
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,960
Why doesn't he wake up?

413
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,080
He needs to sleep. Just let him rest here.

414
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,840
After having these two bottles of medicine,

415
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,960
he can go home with you.

416
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,800
The doctor prescribed some medicine for ulcers

417
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,200
and you can go to

418
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,440
the pharmacy to get it.

419
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,720
Ask your father to eat properly.

420
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,320
OK.

421
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Thank you.

422
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,170
You're welcome.

423
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,480
Let go of me.

424
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,920
I can walk on my own. I'm not paralyzed!

425
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,240
I don't want you to tumble.

426
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,880
I won't tumble.

427
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,640
Look! The three of us can't get inside together.

428
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,520
I just,

429
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,500
I just want to change my shoes.

430
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,820
Let me help you with it.

431
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,720
Haichao,

432
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,440
how did you get into hospital

433
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,570
when I was just away for a little while?

434
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,800
And Jianjian,

435
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,610
what happened to your face?

436
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,920
It's fine.

437
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,040
I'm going to the temple to pray tomorrow.

438
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,320
The results are about to be released.

439
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,120
I'll go to pray.

440
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,480
I hope both of them can get into their ideal schools.

441
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,200
Come on.

442
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,040
Stop worrying about it.

443
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,800
Go and have a good rest now.

444
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,440
The doctor said

445
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,400
if you didn't sleep enough,

446
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
your blood vessel would be brittle.

447
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,400
Go to sleep.

448
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,930
OK, I'm going to have a rest.

449
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,240
Jianjian,

450
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,520
take good care of your father

451
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,560
and I'm going to work now.

452
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,840
Mr. Ling, bye.

453
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,600
Put your shoes over there,

454
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,280
and let me help you with it.

455
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,920
Slower.

456
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,530
Sit down.

457
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Straighten your leg.

458
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm going to untie the shoelaces.

459
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,540
Does it still hurt?

460
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,000
No, it doesn't.

461
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,440
I'll be gentle.

462
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,360
There's another one.

463
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,120
Don't move!

464
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,290
This leg is fine.

465
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,720
OK. OK.

466
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,280
Well...

467
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,240
Dad.

468
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Ziqiu,

469
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,520
why are you sitting here?

470
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,680
I just want to look after you.

471
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,480
I'm fine.

472
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,520
OK.

473
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,300
I'll get up and cook something for you.

474
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,720
Dad, please rest more.

475
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,520
No need.

476
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
Jianjian is tired too.

477
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,680
The doctor said

478
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
that I was fine

479
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,960
and I just needed some more rest.

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,600
What's up?

481
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
Dad! Dad!

482
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,120
Are you OK?

483
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I'm fine.

484
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,560
Did I sit on your wound?

485
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,560
Are you OK?

486
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,680
Look at your face.

487
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,000
Who did it?

488
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,320
Did you see?

489
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,520
Look at you.

490
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm fine.

491
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,320
Mr. Li,

492
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,960
have you got the results

493
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,690
of your kids?

494
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,840
Yes.

495
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,610
They've done a good job.

496
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
What about your daughter?

497
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,620
She'll take the exam next year

498
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,410
and she's about to leave me too.

499
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
I'm sorry.

500
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,460
We're renovating.

501
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
So?

502
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,850
Can't you recognize me?

503
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,320
He Mei!

504
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,360
I borrowed 10,000 yuan from you

505
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,690
when my mother was sick.

506
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,730
Now I'll return 30,000 yuan to you.

507
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,780
Because of the inflation.

508
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,960
Where have you been these years?

509
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,640
Shenzhen.

510
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,770
I work in a beauty salon.

511
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,000
Then

512
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,680
why didn't you contact us

513
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,000
when you got settled?

514
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,250
What if you report it to the police?

515
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,080
I was kidding.

516
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,600
Well, Ziqiu

517
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,700
went to see his classmate.

518
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,080
He just finished the exam

519
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,480
and the result...

520
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,140
I didn't come here to see Ziqiu

521
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,940
and I didn't come here to pay you back.

522
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,680
I came here

523
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,140
because of Zhao Huaguang.

524
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,360
He went to see you?

525
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,480
He asked my former colleagues

526
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,740
about my whereabouts.

527
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,440
He called me

528
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,610
for Ziqiu's guardianship.

529
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,520
I've learnt

530
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,250
what happened to you recently.

531
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,860
Zhao Huaguang is a shameless bastard

532
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,800
that bullies the weak and fears the strong.

533
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,360
You're an honest man

534
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,370
and you're no match for him.

535
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,080
I won't fight with him.

536
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
We're living in a legal society

537
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,560
and he can't do as he wants

538
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,890
just because he's rich.

539
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
He can!

540
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,440
See?

541
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,880
He got your restaurant

542
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,800
closed down.

543
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,810
I'm willing to do anything.

544
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,840
If Ziqiu doesn't want it,

545
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,570
I won't let him take Ziqiu away.

546
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
I used to think

547
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,200
that you were a pushover,

548
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,420
but unexpectedly,

549
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,080
when something is up,

550
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,960
you're

551
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,320
the bravest one.

552
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,140
Even a hare will bite when it's cornered.

553
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,480
When it comes to the children,

554
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,820
I don't think any parents will yield.

555
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,180
Ziqiu is blessed to live with you,

556
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
instead of me.

557
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,320
I, I, I didn't mean that.

558
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,170
I'll be honest with you.

559
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,560
Zhao Huaguang

560
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,320
is really a bastard,

561
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,410
but I've asked about it.

562
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
He is really rich now

563
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,980
and his wife is barren.

564
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,240
He wants

565
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,440
Ziqiu back,

566
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
just because he wants someone

567
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,330
to carry on his family name.

568
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,960
This is not

569
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,800
a bad deal.

570
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,440
So

571
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
you want Ziqiu to go with him?

572
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,400
Ziqiu is not a child

573
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,330
that favors the rich over the poor.

574
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
That's why I came here.

575
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,280
With your current financial condition,

576
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,240
it's hard for you to send Ziqiu

577
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
to study abroad.

578
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,820
And I don't think he's willing to leave here.

579
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,520
Since his childhood,

580
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,440
he thinks he owes you.

581
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,280
And probably

582
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,240
he thinks

583
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,220
he's in your debt all his life.

584
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,000
Now Ziqiu is your son

585
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,900
and I'm just a stranger

586
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,000
who gave birth to him.

587
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,810
I came here to talk with you.

588
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Because I believe

589
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,240
that you want him

590
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,300
to have a bright future more than I do.

591
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Let him stay here

592
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,640
or let him go,

593
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,080
it's up to you.

594
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,160
OK. I'm leaving now.

595
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,920
Just pretend that I've never been here.

596
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,320
Don't tell Ziqiu about it

597
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,240
if you care about him.

598
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,080
Ziqiu still

599
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,240
wants to see you.

600
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,930
I'll be honest with you.

601
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,280
I'm married.

602
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,960
My husband doesn't know

603
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,160
that I have a son.

604
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
To my life,

605
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,720
he is a burden.

606
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,480
Stop!

607
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,240
I'll take what I should have.

608
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,560
From now on,

609
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,360
you don't have to worry about Ziqiu.

610
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,200
Just take good care

611
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,960
of your life.

612
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,280
With your current financial condition,

613
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,240
it's hard for you to send Ziqiu

614
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,800
to study abroad.

615
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,600
And I don't think he's willing to leave here.

616
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,880
Since his childhood,

617
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,880
he thinks he owes you.

618
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,720
And probably

619
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,240
he thinks

620
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,180
he's in your debt all his life.

621
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,480
Now Ziqiu is your son

622
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,220
and I'm just a stranger

623
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,280
who gave birth to him.

624
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,090
I came here to talk with you.

625
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Because I believe

626
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,520
that you want him

627
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,580
to have a bright future more than I do.

628
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Let him stay here

629
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,320
or let him go,

630
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,680
it's up to you.

631
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
She is

632
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
out of danger now,

633
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,080
but she's not stable yet.

634
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,040
She's still in the intensive care unit.

635
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,880
I have no other choice.

636
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,280
I've called

637
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,080
and explained it

638
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,120
to my boss.

639
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,880
When Chen Ting is in this situation,

640
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,800
can I leave?

641
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,760
I have no choice!

642
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,760
Yes.

643
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,160
Thank goodness!

644
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
She's finally out of danger now.

645
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
What's wrong with us?

646
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,400
Why did we all get into hospital?

647
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,640
What's up?

648
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,880
Did anyone fall sick at home?

649
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,000
No. No.

650
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,280
I was just saying.

651
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,920
Xiao,

652
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,520
will you come back before your birthday?

653
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm afraid

654
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,930
I'll be back after that.

655
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,240
Then how do you

656
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,920
fill in your college application form?

657
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,300
You silly girl!

658
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,020
I can fill it in online.

659
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,240
Oh.

660
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,000
By the way,

661
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,360
Mingyue's mother

662
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,840
let her bring you some gifts for college admission,

663
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,880
a pen for both you and Ziqiu.

664
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,560
Her mother asked

665
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,520
that if you would give your class notes

666
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,600
to Mingyue.

667
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,920
OK.

668
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,920
I planned to sell them as waste materials.

669
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,380
Let Ziqiu give them to her.

670
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,400
OK. OK.

671
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,840
OK, that's it.

672
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,760
Wait!

673
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,680
What else?

674
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,360
Say something nice to me.

675
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,800
Xiao,

676
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,120
I miss you so much!

677
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,000
Come back soon!

678
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,640
Love you! Mwah!

679
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,760
Is that all?

680
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,520
It didn't sound sincere.

681
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
Don't be so picky. I've got to go.

682
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,680
What are you laughing at?

683
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,160
Was I funny?

684
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,640
I miss you so much!

685
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,440
Stop it!

686
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,640
The patient is

687
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,680
out of danger now,

688
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,880
but I've told

689
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,560
you before

690
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,720
that there're multiple fractures

691
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,120
and soft tissue injuries throughout her body

692
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,440
which will heal soon.

693
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,120
However, the most serious problem is

694
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,920
the paralysis of the lower limbs

695
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,160
caused by her spinal nerve injury.

696
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,800
The operation was very successful,

697
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,760
but the family members

698
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,240
should be prepared

699
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,570
for a long-term battle,

700
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,080
because the postoperative physical therapy

701
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,480
will take a long process.

702
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
Do you mean

703
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,880
that she probably can't stand up anymore?

704
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,360
It's hard to say about the nerve damage.

705
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,960
It depends on her recovery afterwards.

706
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,840
A lot of patients

707
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,740
actively cooperate with rehabilitation therapy

708
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,820
and then they can

709
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,920
take care of themselves in daily life,

710
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,640
but it requires a lot of perseverance

711
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,120
for not only the patients

712
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,210
but also their family members.

713
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,480
Are you going to burn the bridge after crossing it?

714
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,040
My sister is still

715
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,440
in the intensive care unit,

716
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,760
and you want to leave?

717
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,260
How could you say that?

718
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,570
We've done what we should have.

719
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,450
Back then, it was my parents

720
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,480
who paid every penny

721
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,200
for their house.

722
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,120
Plus my brother's savings

723
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,080
and the insurance money,

724
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,840
it should be at least

725
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,370
a few million yuan in total.

726
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,420
My sister-in-law can have it all.

727
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,480
You know what,

728
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
my dad has been paralyzed in bed

729
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
for more than ten years.

730
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
It's hard for my mom to take care of herself,

731
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,440
but she still has to take care of my father.

732
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,040
My wife and I

733
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,680
have decided

734
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,560
to take care of Chengzi.

735
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,320
Isn't that enough?

736
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,080
You know what,

737
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,040
the one lying inside

738
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,850
was just my sister-in-law.

739
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,360
Now my brother is gone

740
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,080
and she has nothing to do

741
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,680
with my family anymore.

742
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,480
You're her brother

743
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,120
and she has a son.

744
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,680
From now on,

745
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,760
you take care of everything related to her.

746
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,320
How could you say that?

747
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,960
Your brother is gone,

748
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,440
so you have nothing

749
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,239
to do with her?

750
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,480
What about Ling Xiao?

751
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,840
Aren't they blood related?

752
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,560
But we've done most of the work.

753
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,080
We've done something too!

754
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,280
What do you think

755
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,469
about your mother's situation?

756
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,230
I don't know.

757
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
Look,

758
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,840
you're 18 years old now.

759
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,130
And you're an adult now.

760
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,440
Since your mother is in this situation,

761
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,360
from now on,

762
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,260
you have to take care of her

763
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,560
and you have to

764
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,630
take care of many things.

765
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,260
Uncle, what do you think about it?

766
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,920
Here is what I think.

767
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,960
Now the results

768
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,920
of the college entrance exam have been released

769
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,780
and you've got really good grades

770
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,900
with which you can get into any college you want.

771
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,810
Considering your mother's situation right now,

772
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,890
I'm afraid it'll take quite a while

773
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,480
for her to recover in the hospital.

774
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,410
So would you like

775
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,040
to go to college here?

776
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,320
Then

777
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,650
you can take care of your mother

778
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,620
and continue your education,

779
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,040
which is the best choice now.

780
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
What do you think?

781
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,000
What do I think?

782
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,200
Why?

783
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
She is your mother.

784
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,850
Shouldn't you take care of her?

785
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
She abandoned me

786
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,560
when she divorced my dad.

787
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,370
So why should I take care of her?

788
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
Your mother did something wrong back then,

789
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,080
but she's still your mother.

790
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
You're her son

791
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,690
and you should forgive her.

792
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,640
Why?

793
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,570
Because she is your mother!

794
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,960
She gave birth to you!

795
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
Ling Xiao,

796
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,460
will you really leave her alone here?

797
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,460
What about you?

798
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,980
Won't you take care of her?

799
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,480
How can I?

800
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
I've already

801
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,120
taken a month off.

802
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,400
My wife has been asking

803
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,060
me go back home over the phone.

804
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,080
As her brother,

805
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,120
I've done my best.

806
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,930
I've done everything that I could.

807
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
What are you thinking about?

808
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Letting Ziqiu study abroad?

809
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,040
What are you thinking about?

810
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,560
Well,

811
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
are you out of your mind?

812
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
You've almost broken my shoulder!

813
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,640
OK, stop doing it.

814
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,960
Explain it now.

815
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,200
What are you thinking about?

816
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,930
Isn't it great to study abroad?

817
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
You know,

818
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,760
I've asked Zhu Peng's mother

819
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,840
about it.

820
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,240
Zhu Peng's

821
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,600
cousin is

822
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,130
studying abroad right now.

823
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,580
She said that it was great over there,

824
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,780
but the tuition is too expensive.

825
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
It costs hundreds of thousands a year,

826
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
but it's OK.

827
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,480
Because when they graduate,

828
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,120
they're so popular with the foreign companies.

829
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,360
Do you know

830
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
how much their annual salary can be?

831
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,240
It's more than 200,000 yuan!

832
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,880
Think about it!

833
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,120
Can a family

834
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,280
like us afford

835
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,840
to study abroad?

836
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,520
We can't afford it

837
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,400
no matter how hard we try!

838
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,440
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

839
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,560
Just a few days ago, you were yelling about

840
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,600
getting a good lawyer

841
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,680
and going to court.

842
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,280
Why did you change your mind?

843
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,730
It's different now.

844
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,840
I'm looking at it from the child's perspective

845
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,700
and I'm doing this for his future.

846
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,880
Don't tell Ziqiu about this.

847
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,010
He won't agree to it.

848
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,080
I know.

849
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,920
So I want you to help me.

850
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,480
I say,

851
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,960
if he refuses,

852
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,640
we have to be on the same page

853
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,360
to persuade him.

854
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,890
There is a kind of bird in this world

855
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,760
that lays eggs

856
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,920
in others' nests,

857
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,200
so others will

858
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,240
hatch its eggs

859
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
and raise them up,

860
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,600
and then it'll fly back

861
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,920
to take the birdies away.

862
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,250
Do you know what you are?

863
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,320
You are

864
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,640
the foolish bird

865
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,530
that hatches others' eggs.

866
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,080
Don't talk those nonsense

867
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,680
with me.

868
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,660
It's different, you know?

869
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,200
My birdies

870
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,120
are different,

871
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,650
you know?

872
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,760
I'm quite confident.

873
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,600
Even if someone takes away my birdies

874
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,080
and spend money

875
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,240
on their education,

876
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,520
when they graduate,

877
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,280
my birdies

878
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
will still

879
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,120
come back home.

880
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,720
You think I'm foolish?

881
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
You know what,

882
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,480
Zhao Huaguang is the foolish one.

883
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,000
What you said does make sense.

884
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,440
Right?

885
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,320
Our kids

886
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,400
are grateful and kind.

887
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,560
Of course!

888
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,320
I think we should jump

889
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
out of the circle

890
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,280
and look at the bigger picture.

891
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,220
Yes, you're right.

892
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,960
Right?

893
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,330
Let's just do it.

894
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,520
No, no.

895
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
It's too far away.

896
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,840
That's going abroad

897
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,100
and it takes more than 10 hours of flight.

898
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,040
It doesn't matter.

899
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,720
For his own good,

900
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,560
we should let him go.

901
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,320
Well, why are you so cruel?

902
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,620
Whatever you say about me.

903
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,400
But,

904
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,440
but,

905
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
it's settled, OK?

906
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,840
That's settled.

907
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,720
OK. OK.

908
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,130
OK. Let's just do it.

909
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,490
Where was I just now?

910
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,720
You patted me on the shoulder

911
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,080
and interrupted me.

912
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
Now I don't know

913
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,090
where I was just now.

914
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,440
You read the numbers and I'll help you with it.

915
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,100
There it is.

916
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,330
How much?

917
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,160
116.

918
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,360
116.

919
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,450
Dad, Mr. Ling, I'm back.

920
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,530
You're back.

921
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,560
Where is your classmate?

922
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
His mother called him to go home.

923
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,360
Where is Li Jianjian?

924
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,720
She went to

925
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,240
play with Qi Mingyue.

926
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,530
Wash your hands and come to eat.

927
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,080
OK.

928
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,540
You're wet with sweat.

929
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,080
Do it on your own.

930
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,010
I won't help you.

931
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,620
Maybe he'll listen to you.

932
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,600
Didn't we agree on it?

933
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,680
What did I agree to?

934
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,240
I haven't made up my mind.

935
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,160
How could you do this?

936
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,520
How could you go back on your word?

937
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,760
Come on. I've never gone back on my word.

938
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,520
But you...

939
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,480
Come. Let's eat.

940
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,300
There are pies!

941
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,240
Let's eat.

942
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,610
I'll have one first.

943
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,720
Dad,

944
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,680
my teacher

945
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,640
called today

946
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,040
to instruct me

947
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,060
how to fill in the college application form.

948
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,040
What did he say?

949
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
He recommended me

950
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,720
to choose Beijing Jiaotong University as my first choice,

951
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,640
but I told him

952
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,800
that I needed to discuss about it with you.

953
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
I think it's good.

954
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Haven't you always wanted

955
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,640
to go to that college?

956
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,480
I support you!

957
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,760
Since both of you are here today,

958
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,880
I want to discuss about it

959
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,000
with you.

960
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,000
Yes, let's discuss about it.

961
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,690
Actually I've been thinking about it for a long time.

962
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,200
I just feel

963
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,680
that I want to study abroad.
