1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,910
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Episode 4

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Thank you.

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
Sorry for bothering you so much.

6
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll treat you to dinner when it's done.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,920
There's only one day left of the weekend.

8
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,380
I also have homework to do.

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
I asked someone to

10
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,280
let you be crammed into the tutoring class of math.

11
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,600
One student of the teacher

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,680
got admitted to Peking University last year.

13
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,000
Your math is kinda weak.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You failed to solve one big problem.

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,760
It's because the math teacher

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,320
set the wrong problem.

17
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
It's one of the twelfth grade.

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,460
But Wang Yajie got a full mark.

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,120
You'll have to

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,720
get along with some good classmates

21
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,400
like Yajie

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
instead of always

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,300
staying with Li Jianjian.

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,440
I won't restrict you

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
to making a friend,

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
but you have to making friends

27
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
with those who're aspirant.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,930
Then you can interact one another.

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,400
Okay.

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,440
I usually talk about

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,900
problems with Wang Yajie.

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
You're so well-behaved.

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Well, what about sending you

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
a digital camera

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,000
on your birthday?

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,170
Are you serious?

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,240
Thank you, Mom.

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
But I have one condition.

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
You'll have to get a better score

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,320
than Wang Yajie in the next exam.

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
You used to rank second

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
when you were in junior school.

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,370
You have to prove yourself.

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
Okay.

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Goodbye, Mom.

46
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,880
What do you wanna eat for dinner?

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,320
I intend to go to a cafe

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
and do a paper

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,960
with Wang Yajie together this evening.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,600
And we'll have hotpot together.

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
Fine. It's okay.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Do you have enough money?

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,600
Treat your classmate to dinner, will you?

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Mom, could you please give me another 100 yuan?

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
I am giving you 300 hundred yuan.

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,680
Mom, you're always the kindest.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Goodbye, Mom.

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,800
Hello, Mentor.

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
Hello.

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,060
Catch the ball.

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,100
Zhuang Bei.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,360
He Ziqiu, fighting.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,480
That man who looks like a chimpanzee

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,640
is the best friend of my second brother.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Which one?

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,120
Except your second brother,

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
all the others look like a chimpanzee.

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
The one who looks like the most

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,690
is named Zhuang Bei.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,560
Fighting.

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
He Ziqiu, fighting.

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
He Ziqiu, fighting.

73
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,280
He Ziqiu, fighting.

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
He Ziqiu, fighting.

75
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,920
He Ziqiu, fighting.

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,040
Water, water, water.

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,120
Here it is.

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,050
Okay. Thank you.

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
Have a look at it.

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,280
What?

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,620
You drew a sketch of me?

82
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,480
Open it for me, please.

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
I drew it seriously.

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
It looks too ugly.

85
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,720
Why?

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,520
Look at the leg and the arm.

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
It doesn't look like me, does it?

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,840
You're smelly. You're smelly.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,640
You're sweating heavily. Stay away from me.

90
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Stay away from me.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,640
You're avoiding me because of my smell?

92
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,400
Well, let me wipe my sweat with this.

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
You're avoiding me because of my smell, aren't you?

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
He Ziqiu,

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,920
take it away. Go take it back and wash it.

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
You wanna make me wash clothes for you again.

97
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,120
No way.

98
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,600
Handsome Ling,

99
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
someone is waiting for you outside.

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Hand it out for me.

101
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,800
I remember when I left,

102
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360
you were a child.

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,160
How fast time flies!

104
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
You've grown up.

105
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,250
I can hardly recognize you.

106
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I live in Singapore now.

107
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,170
And I got married again.

108
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,080
I know.

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,280
Grandmother has told me.

110
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,520
Then you must have know

112
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
you've got a younger sister now,

113
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,380
whose name is Chengzi.

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,640
She always wanna

115
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
see you.

116
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
Why does she wanna see me?

117
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,860
I don't know her at all.

118
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,440
But you run the same blood

119
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,200
in your veins.

120
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,080
She can be counted as your relative, can't she?

121
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,840
Do you have anything else?

122
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm leaving first.

123
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,640
I heard…

124
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,200
I heard your father

125
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,610
is still busy with work.

126
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,080
And he doesn't get married again.

127
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,200
So he always keeps you staying

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,660
in the place of Li Haichao.

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Is Li Haichao nice to you?

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Your father pays him, doesn't he?

131
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,760
Has he spent all the money on you?

132
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Father Li doesn't take care of me

133
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
because of money.

134
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
It's not what I meant.

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
I mean, if you

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
feel aggrieved

137
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,600
or uncomfortable,

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
you won't have to bury it in your heart.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Remember to tell your grandmother…

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,460
Have you thought too much?

141
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,580
Father Li treats me as his own son.

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,960
I treat him as my own father,

143
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,159
and I'll take care of him when he is aged.

144
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
You've had a new family

145
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
while I have mine.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,520
I have no idea why

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
you come back.

148
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,960
And you even judged

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
my family.

150
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,480
You left

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
me to Jianjian at that time, didn't you?

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
I know I did something wrong…

154
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,160
But I didn't have any other option then.

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,960
At that time,

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,220
I myself really wasn't

158
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,600
good.

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,480
If I had kept you

160
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,560
by my side,

161
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,360
you would have been hurt

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,240
more heavily.

163
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,400
I wasn't able to

164
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
take care of myself then.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,360
Leaving you behind wasn't…

166
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,760
I do miss you.

167
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,060
Why hasn't he come out yet?

168
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Hey, Li Jianjian,

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,780
go inside and drag him out.

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,880
That's his mother.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,860
Hasn't she left Ling Xiao behind?

172
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,280
She has been caring nothing of Ling Xiao for so many years,

173
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,080
and she didn't make a call to him.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,900
How could she be regarded as a mother?

175
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,720
It's true.

176
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,720
But

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,010
haven't you ever thought about finding your mother?

178
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,170
Why should I?

179
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
Are you asking me to beat you?

180
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Are you an idiot?

181
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
They treat us like rubbish

182
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,600
that they could throw away and find back

183
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,920
as they want, don't they?

184
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,960
It's fine. It's fine.

185
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,800
It's fine that you haven't thought about it.

186
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't get angry.

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,800
It's because you were being spineless.

188
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,180
Fine. I'll go back to my class.

189
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,000
You can wait here by yourself if you're willing to.

190
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,560
When I find a job

191
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,760
in Shenzhen,

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,360
I'll fetch you there.

193
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,800
Mom,

194
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,540
you should come to fetch me as soon as you can.

195
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
Mom,

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
you should come to fetch me as soon as you can.

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm really sorry.

198
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,680
Could you forgive me?

199
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,980
Do you have anything else?

200
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,370
I'm leaving.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,680
I…

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,560
Don't you know that the Academic Director has been finding

203
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,220
couples who are in puppy love around the school?

204
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,180
Don't let our fathers know

205
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
we met her.

206
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Have you heard me?

207
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,440
Yep.

208
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,800
Stand still, the two of you.

209
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,920
The boy and girl.

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,380
Which class are you in?

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,360
Let's run.

212
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,610
Stop, the two of you.

213
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,840
Hello. Welcome.

214
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,770
How many guests?

215
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,280
I've made an appointment with my friend.

216
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,520
The guest should have been inside.

217
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,160
Thank you.

218
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,080
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,280
I'm late since I had something to do in the police station.

220
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,340
It doesn't matter.

221
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,000
I've been waiting only for more than one hour.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,320
I used to wait longer.

223
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
I did have something to do in the police station.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Have some tea.

225
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,240
Oh.

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's Tie Guanyin.

227
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,040
I don't like it because it might hurt my stomach.

228
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,240
Give me a cup of water.

229
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm thirsty because I've said so much

230
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,040
in the police station.

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,720
Your accent

232
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,080
has changed.

233
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,400
What? Has it?

234
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,690
It's quite obvious.

235
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,840
You look younger.

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,600
Our child has grown up.

237
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,000
How could I look younger?

238
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,960
Thank you.

239
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,520
Thank you for taking care of

240
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,840
the school thing of my daughter.

241
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,360
Well.

242
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
You should take this

243
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,880
and finish the admission procedures in the school. Then it's done.

244
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Sorry to bother you.

245
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,660
It's not a big deal.

246
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,680
I also heard

247
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,610
my mother always asks you for help.

248
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,280
She did these inappropriately because she's aged.

249
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,940
You can refuse her as you want.

250
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,540
Your mother is the grandmother of Ling Xiao.

251
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,800
She's a relative.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,280
I'll help her if I can.

253
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
You're always

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,960
warmhearted as you used to be.

255
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,680
I married you

256
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,160
because of it.

257
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,480
Your husband will

258
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,320
come to work here for merely half a year, won't he?

259
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,240
Do you have to transfer your daughter here?

260
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Transferring to another school

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,170
isn't good for the study of a child.

262
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,010
It's because

263
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,620
I have to come here to take care of my husband.

264
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
My husband thinks

265
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,930
a family should stay together.

266
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
And a child should always be by the side of her parents

267
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,260
instead of making her parents yield.

268
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,480
So I'd better transfer my daughter here.

269
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,360
It's the best

270
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,680
cultivation for my child.

271
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,480
Well.

272
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,240
Right. Right. Right.

273
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,100
Company means the most to a child.

274
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,640
You finally get it.

275
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,700
Well, I'm leaving.

276
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
Well…

277
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,460
Feel free to say it.

278
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,760
I'll help you if I can.

279
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
There's nothing important.

280
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,760
But

281
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,520
I went to meet Ling Xiao.

282
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,520
Who allowed you to do it?

283
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,040
I think I haven't seen him for long.

284
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,920
Besides, both my mother and elder brother said

285
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,850
I should pay more attention to him.

286
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,480
I have to stay here for half a year this time.

287
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
And Chengzi hasn't seen her elder brother yet.

288
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,640
I thought they are siblings.

289
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,480
They

290
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,920
should meet each other.

291
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,650
Chen Ting, you've gone too far.

292
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
Show your concern for him?

293
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,160
Why shouldn't you have done it earlier?

294
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,120
You've been away from him for ten years.

295
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,840
Now you wanna show your concern for him.

296
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,680
You should have asked him

297
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,040
whether he wanted to meet you.

298
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,080
I just wanna make up to him.

299
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,080
As his biological mother,

300
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,800
it's proper for me

301
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,960
to meet my own son.

302
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,280
You get to know you're

303
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,440
his biological mother.

304
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,840
You should have done it earlier.

305
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,080
You don't know it's always

306
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,160
a nightmare for Ling Xiao, do you?

307
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,320
Is it caused

308
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
by me alone?

309
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,490
Aren't you on the same team with me?

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,080
I was sick then,

311
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
so I took

312
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,970
all the responsibilities.

313
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
But over the years,

314
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,680
have you done what a father should do?

315
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,000
You left your child in the place of your neighbor

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,760
without taking care of him.

317
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,000
You paid your neighbor some living costs each month.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,730
So that's it?

319
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,280
Li Haichao had to take care of

320
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,200
three children.

321
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,530
Do you think he could take care of him well?

322
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Ling Xiao told me

323
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,880
he treats Li Haichao as his own father.

324
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,320
Does it mean if you hired

325
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,080
a maid for him,

326
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,000
he would treat her

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,920
as his own mother?

328
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,640
Li Haichao is his own father.

329
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,320
So what?

330
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
Then who on earth

331
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,000
are you, his biological father?

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,860
I'm telling you

333
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,800
never to meet Ling Xiao

334
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,920
and find him in the future.

335
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,880
I'm begging you

336
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
to let us go. Okay?

337
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,369
You're making trouble.

338
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,760
Have you finished your mathematics assignment?

339
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,490
Let me check.

340
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,960
I'm not able to do it.

341
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,040
Haven't I told you

342
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,560
how to deal with the problems?

343
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,620
I'll do it as soon as I finish drawing.

344
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Second brother.

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,200
Yep.

346
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,280
What are you doing?

347
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,600
Let her draw since she likes it.

348
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
Isn't the broom dirty?

349
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,450
Hurry and do your homework.

350
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,280
Father Ling.

351
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,740
Father Ling has come back.

352
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,040
You're doing your homework, aren't you?

353
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,520
Dad.

354
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,600
Ling Xiao,

355
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,400
well, today…

356
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,520
What's up?

357
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,160
Nothing.

358
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Do your homework.

359
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,240
Hey, stop.

360
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,520
Stop wiping the floor. It's been pretty clean already.

361
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,250
Go back home.

362
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,320
Haichao.

363
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,850
Go back to do your homework.

364
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,320
What are they gonna talk?

365
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,600
Of course it should be something

366
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,640
we couldn't know.

367
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Do your homework.

368
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,120
Chen Ting

369
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,040
went to the school

370
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,370
to find Ling Xiao today.

371
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,480
She hasn't contacted you

372
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,940
for so many years. How come

373
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,040
she went to the school

374
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,120
without noticing you in advance?

375
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,200
That's the thing.

376
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,120
I met her today.

377
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,160
Well, she acted

378
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,920
insufferably arrogant.

379
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,580
What a lofty lady she has been!

380
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
She even talked about the cultivation with me.

381
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,080
We talked about

382
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,280
the transferring thing of her present child.

383
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,200
She said she couldn't let her daughter be away from her,

384
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
which pissed me off.

385
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
Well, does it mean our Ling Xiao

386
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,040
was supposed to be away from his own mother?

387
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,370
I'm telling you she must

388
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
have said many

389
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,540
unpleasant words.

390
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
Have you asked Ling Xiao about it?

391
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,480
I wanted to ask him just now.

392
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,880
But I found he seemed unwilling to talk about it.

393
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,040
You have to ask him even if he doesn't wanna talk about it.

394
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Why should I have to ask about it?

395
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,800
Have a look at them. He seemed to be happy just now.

396
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,320
I think

397
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,740
he might not care about it so much.

398
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
I've warned Chen Ting

399
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,560
not to go to the school

400
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,800
and find Ling Xiao in the future anyway.

401
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Has she promised you?

402
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
The words I'd said were quite harsh.

403
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,530
But according to her personality,

404
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm not sure.

405
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
You have to deal with the thing well.

406
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I know.

407
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,960
Well,

408
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,440
you should ask Ling Xiao about it

409
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,780
when you have time.

410
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
He always tells you everything.

411
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,360
Okay. I'll figure out a way.

412
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,320
Don't worry.

413
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
Someone, help.

414
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Help.

415
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,520
Someone, help.

416
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,160
Help.

417
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,160
Someone, help.

418
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,800
Anyone here?

419
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,200
Open the door.

420
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,730
Pigsy, Wang Doudou.

421
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't think it's proper.

422
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,160
Brother said it would be fine.

423
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,440
Help me out, pigsy.

424
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,080
Let's go.

425
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,920
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

426
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,000
Li Jianjian, give me back the umbrella.

427
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,480
Li Jianjian, what are you doing?

428
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,880
I'll go tell your father.

429
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,240
Dad, I'm back.

430
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,080
Ling Xiao.

431
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
Good boy.

432
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,840
You're back.

433
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,760
You've grown taller.

434
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,240
Grandma, why do you come here?

435
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,280
Your mom sprained her ankle.

436
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,880
So she asked me

437
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,340
to cook for you in two days.

438
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,840
Ling Xiao,

439
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
I've heard from your mother

440
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,160
that she's too busy

441
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
to bring your younger sister to you.

442
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Come here,

443
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,080
Chengzi.

444
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,280
This is your brother.

445
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,640
Are you too happy to move?

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,480
You've been saying

447
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,880
you wanna meet your elder brother

448
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,640
all the time at home.

449
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,440
Come here. This is your brother.

450
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,610
Hurry and come here.

451
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,280
Brother.

452
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
You're my brother.

453
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
How did you practice at home?

454
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,300
Say something.

455
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,360
Brother, nice to meet you.

456
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm Qin Meiyang.

457
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,320
I'm in the first grade of primary school.

458
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,040
I've prepared a gift for you

459
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,640
when I come here.

460
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,640
I hope you would like it.

461
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,960
Take it.

462
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,540
Who allowed you to bring her here?

463
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,440
Go sit there, my girl.

464
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Come here. Come here.

465
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,040
Come here.

466
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,480
Come here.

467
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,280
Don't look at it.

468
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
Hurry and call your Father Ling.

469
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,500
Let him come back as soon as he can.

470
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,100
Do you want a candy?

471
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,560
Chengzi is your biological sister.

472
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,400
You haven't met one another before,

473
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
but biologically speaking,

474
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,200
except your parents,

475
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
she's the closest one to you.

476
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
I don't need a younger sister.

477
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,920
I've already had one.

478
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,840
Li Jianjian, that kind of younger sister,

479
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,720
can't be compared with a cousin.

480
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,960
So how could she be compared with Chengzi?

481
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,200
Li Haichao took care of you

482
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,080
because your father paid him.

483
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,690
How could you be that silly?

484
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,960
If you judge my Father Li like this again,

485
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
don't come here anymore in the future.

486
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,760
What?

487
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,520
Do you wanna

488
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,480
split up with me?

489
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,240
You're too naive

490
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Will I harm you as your grandmother?

491
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,800
Don't you know who's nice to you?

492
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,840
I know it for sure.

493
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,600
Could you please not come

494
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,240
to find my father anymore in the future?

495
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,560
Is there a relationship between him and you?

496
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,200
You don't have a son or a son-in-law, do you?

497
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,760
You…

498
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,600
How could you say like this?

499
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Who taught you to act like that?

500
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
Leave here with the child inside

501
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
when you finish acting the play.

502
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,320
Don't come to bother us anymore.

503
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,840
You…you…

504
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,400
How could you talk like this?

505
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,840
Who taught you to say this?

506
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,480
What a rude child you're!

507
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:01,960
Grandma. Grandma.

508
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
Don't hit him. Don't hit him.

509
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm teaching him a lesson.

510
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,520
He's not well-behaved.

511
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,000
You can talk to him without hitting him.

512
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,960
Father Ling will be distressed when he know it.

513
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,760
He'll feel distressed if I hit him for once.

514
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,040
It seems he hasn't been hit before,

515
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,520
so he's not well-behaved.

516
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,540
He deserves it.

517
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
Since he's ill-bred.

518
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,000
He's not.

519
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,880
It's fine. Go inside.

520
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,360
Jianjian.

521
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
Grandma, well,

522
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,720
if you wanna talk with him, please talk inside.

523
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,600
You're standing in the rain.

524
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,280
Your…your shoes are getting wet.

525
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,720
Wow, the shoes you wear are new.

526
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,760
Enough. Enough.

527
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,480
What an ill-bred child!

528
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,480
What the hell?

529
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,540
What an annoying old lady!

530
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,320
You're leaving, aren't you?

531
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,320
Shall I call a taxi for you?

532
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,800
No need. I'll go by myself.

533
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,840
Will my brother go with us?

534
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,090
No, he won't.

535
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,160
And you're gonna stay here too today.

536
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,920
You'll stay here.

537
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,880
Since you won't have to go to school tomorrow.

538
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,120
Have fun with your brother.

539
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,840
Behave well.

540
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,280
Sure.

541
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
You can't leave her here.

542
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,160
Don't worry.

543
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,000
I won't leave her in your place.

544
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,440
It's none of your business.

545
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,920
If Ling Xiao doesn't take care of her,

546
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,000
he can leave her

547
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,800
in the street.

548
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,440
What?

549
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,360
Nope.

550
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
You can't leave the child here.

551
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,160
Hey.

552
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,280
Well,

553
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,640
is the old lady out of her mind?

554
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,440
Who are you?

555
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
Li Jianjian.

556
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
Why do you call my brother

557
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Brother?

558
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,240
Because he's my brother.

559
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,370
How could it happen?

560
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,240
My mom said

561
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,960
my brother has only one sister, who is me.

562
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,000
She only gave birth to my brother and me.

563
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,760
Besides,

564
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,620
you don't have the same last name.

565
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,280
Yours is also different from mine.

566
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,520
Then you're supposed

567
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,840
to have the same last name, Qin, as me,

568
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,600
aren't you?

569
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,480
Nope.

570
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,600
Your mother abandoned him in the first place.

571
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,360
There's no relationship between him and you.

572
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,080
Do you know?

573
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,520
You're talking nonsense.

574
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,120
Mom would cry

575
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,200
each time

576
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,760
she thought about my brother.

577
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,480
Mom said

578
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
we didn't live together,

579
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,850
but our hearts were connected.

580
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,760
What are you two doing?

581
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,880
Why do you say this to a child?

582
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,440
I'm also a child.

583
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,840
You've been such a big girl…

584
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
How could you say…

585
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,280
Where's his grandma?

586
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
She's left already.

587
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,200
You know you should come back, don't you?

588
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
I think you would have been

589
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,840
swept away by the heavy rain.

590
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,560
There's so much work in the police station.

591
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,200
You mean…

592
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,800
I won't count on you anymore.

593
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,120
I'd rather call 110.

594
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,280
If I should come here as a policeman,

595
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,610
it would be a lot faster.

596
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm going home first.

597
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,080
I haven't finished my homework.

598
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,880
Ziqiu, Jianjian, let's go back.

599
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,240
Brother, where're you going?

600
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,120
Brother.

601
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,120
Brother.

602
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,280
Take umbrellas with you.

603
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,600
They're going home.

604
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,920
I'm here to take you home.

605
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,240
I don't wanna go home. I want my brother.

606
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,930
Brother.

607
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,000
Behave well.

608
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,960
The uncle is a policeman.

609
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,840
If you don't behave well…

610
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,920
Right. Right. Right.

611
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,560
Shall I take you home?

612
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,520
I don't wanna go home. I want my brother.

613
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,880
Brother.

614
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,240
Brother.

615
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,760
You…

616
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,040
You can deal with it as you want.

617
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
I want my brother.

618
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,720
All I want is my brother.

619
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,600
How much does the Chinese cabbage cost?

620
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,860
Two yuan for 500 grams.

621
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,800
The price is up.

622
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,240
It's not.

623
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,920
Vegetables are more expensive than they were.

624
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,720
The vegetables sold in town are always expensive.

625
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,960
I can buy one kilogram of it

626
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,080
in our county.

627
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,800
Granny,

628
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,240
we've trimmed it before.

629
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,040
So there're no withered leaves.

630
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Please don't trim it anymore.

631
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,440
If you keep trimming it, there'll be only the flowering cabbage.

632
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,400
The leaves I trim are withered.

633
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,660
It's okay. Weigh it up.

634
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,440
Granny,

635
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,480
someone like you had better

636
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
come to buy vegetables

637
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,400
when our stalls are about to be closed.

638
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
The vegetables are sold at a cheaper price then.

639
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,440
You're a vegetable seller,

640
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
how could you say like that?

641
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,400
You don't allow your guests

642
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,960
to pick and choose your vegetables, do you?

643
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,560
You're looking down upon me.

644
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,760
Have a look at my daughter.

645
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,000
Does she look like anyone who can't afford the vegetables?

646
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm telling you

647
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,040
both my daughter and son-in-law

648
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,600
are high-ranking administrators in Singaporean companies.

649
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,000
They drive a Benz when they go out.

650
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
They're loaded.

651
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,320
Why do you say these to him?

652
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm sorry. She's old.

653
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,440
How much is it?

654
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,700
Two yuan and nine jiao.

655
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,240
Don't give short weight.

656
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,440
Granny, see for yourself.

657
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,040
Does it cost two yuan and nine jiao?

658
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,170
Okay. Okay. I get it.

659
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,760
Okay.

660
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,520
Here you're. Give me the change.

661
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,400
I mean,

662
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,360
you sent Chengzi

663
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,120
to the place of Ling Xiao,

664
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,720
he wouldn't be happy with it.

665
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,960
You have to give him some time

666
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,320
to accept the truth.

667
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Besides, what you've done

668
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,320
won't work.

669
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,880
You sent the child

670
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,720
to the store of Li Haichao

671
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,560
while Ling Heping

672
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,600
sent her back.

673
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
You don't get it.

674
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
What I intend to do is let Chengzi

675
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,720
stay with her elder brother

676
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,180
and make him get used to it.

677
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,760
The child has been deserted

678
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,320
by you for such a long time.

679
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,800
If you don't take the initiative to communicate with him,

680
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,060
who will break the ice?

681
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,680
But now,

682
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,240
when I meet Ling Xiao,

683
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,970
I have no idea what I should say.

684
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,280
When I meet him,

685
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,360
I even feel

686
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,440
scared.

687
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,600
You got divorced silently.

688
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,680
What did I say in the first place?

689
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,960
You got divorced

690
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,280
and you didn't take care of your child.

691
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,160
You must end up with

692
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,640
regret.

693
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,050
What happens in the end?

694
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,880
I didn't agree

695
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,680
you got married with Ling Heping.

696
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,360
I introduced the colleague

697
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,760
of your elder brother

698
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,920
whose parents did business in Beijing to you.

699
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,280
And he looked mighty.

700
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,400
He did look mighty.

701
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,130
Since he weighed 90 kilograms.

702
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,640
Could you please stop

703
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,880
talking about the past?

704
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,940
Isn't your current son-in-law good?

705
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,960
You were

706
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,040
so lucky

707
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
to meet him.

708
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,600
Besides,

709
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,760
stop bothering

710
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,160
Ling Helping all the time.

711
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,090
You don't have your own son, do you?

712
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
I know I have my own son.

713
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,320
I do it on purpose.

714
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
That I bother him always

715
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,440
is because I wanna keep in touch with Ling Xiao.

716
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,480
You know, Ling Heping

717
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,920
is so kind and honest

718
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,160
that his own son is almost gonna

719
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,280
call Li Haichao father.

720
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,880
But he's

721
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,130
still happy with it.

722
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,560
You can only

723
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
count on me

724
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,160
to scheme it for you.

725
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,280
What's up? You don't wanna play basketball, do you?

726
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,840
Nope.

727
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,370
Let's continue.

728
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,380
Nope. What do you mean?

729
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,680
What's wrong with you?

730
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
What's wrong with you actually?

731
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
It's not your mother who came to find you.

732
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,120
Why are so perturbed?

733
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Even if I tell you the whole story of our family,

734
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,360
you won't understand it.

735
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,060
Yep. I really don't get it.

736
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,680
The Handsome Ling

737
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,400
is always unique.

738
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Even if he doesn't wanna admit it,

739
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,320
she's his mother anyway.

740
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,280
Qin Meiyang

741
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,560
is his biological sister anyway.

742
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,880
Is he too hardhearted?

743
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,600
If you don't get to know the whole story,

744
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,760
could you please stop judging it?

745
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,360
I can stop,

746
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,280
but why did you push me?

747
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,480
I make it clear to you that

748
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,560
there're five members in my family in total.

749
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,620
The others don't belong to my family.

750
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,320
Then why do you keep trying to find your mother

751
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,250
who doesn't belong to your family?

752
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,120
Why I keep looking for her is to ask her

753
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
why she abandoned me.

754
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,600
And I've to take back the money

755
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,060
that belongs to my father.

756
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,640
What if she says

757
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,120
her family was in trouble at that time?

758
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,960
Do you mean your mother would abandon you,

759
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
if her family was in trouble?

760
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
I mean it.

761
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,480
What if she was

762
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
a junkwoman?

763
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,080
Your mother was

764
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,840
a junkwoman.

765
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,200
Is it what I meant?

766
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Hey. Come on. Forget about it. Forget about it.

767
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,160
I'll accompany you to pick up your younger sister.

768
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,360
Let's go have hotpot.

769
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,700
You can go by yourself.

770
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,920
He Ziqiu.

771
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,940
Do you know her?

772
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,120
I'm sorry. I mistake you for someone else.

773
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,180
It doesn't matter.

774
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,800
Who do you mistake her for?

775
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,720
An elder brother.

776
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,200
What?

777
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,040
Nope.

778
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,290
An elder sister.

779
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,680
You scared me to death.

780
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,240
I thought you mistook her

781
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,170
for your mother.

782
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm coming.

783
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,160
You hardly remembered the time

784
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,200
when you played basketball.

785
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,960
I happened to meet Qi Mingyue

786
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,600
and her mother.

787
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,730
Her tutoring class has just been over.

788
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
The bus is coming.

789
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,850
Let's go.

790
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,520
♫Thinking of the first time that I held your hand,♫

791

L-i-b-e-r-a-t-i-o-n.

♫My children,♫

♫maybe when you leave here♫

802
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,840
Why do you know a boy of

803
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,200
the twelfth grade?

804
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,400
He's the second brother of Li Jianjian.

805
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,840
L-i-b-e-r…

806
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,120
Didn't you call him He Ziqiu?

807
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,610
He's a cousin of her?

808
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Nope.

809
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,400
It's…

810
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,440
He Ziqiu's mother almost

811
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,640
got married with Li Jianjian's father.

812
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,480
And then…

813
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,960
Well, he's her second brother anyway.

814
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,920
Liberation.

815
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,600
You even know him.

816
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,290
Do you still play with Li Jianjian?

817
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,760
Nope. I'm the monitor.

818
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,840
I've to know something about the family backgrounds

819
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,160
of my classmates.

820
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,680
Qi Mingyue,

821
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
you're going through the crucial time.

822
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,840
You've to take study as your priority.

823
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,699
Don't think about anything else.

824
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,080
Mom, what are you talking about?

825
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,710
I'm an experienced person.

826
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,630
When you get admitted to university,

827
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,830
I won't restrict you.

828
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,230
Mom, haven't you always asked me

829
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,360
to stay with those who are good at studying?

830
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,880
Li Jianjian's second brother

831
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,480
ranks top 10 in his class

832
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
while her elder brother has ranked first in his grade

833
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,320
since he entered the school.

834
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,840
He must get admitted to Peking University in the future.

835
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,630
Are you serious?

836
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,290
Why would I lie to you about it?

837
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,239
Mom, you're driving.

838
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,840
What an elder lady she is!

839
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,600
She took advantage of her seniority.

840
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,400
She always takes Chengzi

841
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,000
here when she's at leisure.

842
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
She's that aged

843
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,610
and she's an elder of us.

844
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,820
We can't kick her out of our place,

845
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,640
can we?

846
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
The elder can

847
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,280
do whatever she wants here.

848
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,960
You are not able to figure out a way.

849
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,890
What else can I do

850
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,180
since I'm an outsider?

851
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,890
What are you talking about?

852
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,440
How could you treat yourself

853
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,520
as an outsider?

854
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,280
How come I'm not an outsider?

855
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,380
I'm neither a family nor an outsider.

856
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
You're narrow-minded.

857
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,160
Don't worry.

858
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
The child himself

859
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
knows who's his real family.

860
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,520
We'd better bear it.

861
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,040
It'll only last for a few months.

862
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,760
We can bear it.

863
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,080
But will our children be able to bear it?

864
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,810
Haven't you seen how depressed

865
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,370
Ling Xiao was in these days?

866
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,160
Besides, Ziqiu and Xiaojian

867
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,200
were unhappy.

868
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,360
Right.

869
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,480
But Ling Xiao

870
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,960
has to get used to it, doesn't he?

871
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,380
They're his own mother and grandmother.

872
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,280
And Chengzi

873
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,960
is his half-blood younger sister anyway.

874
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,690
These things can't be changed.

875
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
Ling Xiao is too sensitive.

876
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,800
If he can be as unconcerned as Ziqiu,

877
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
that'll be great.

878
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,480
Okay.

879
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,660
We'll bear it if you say so.

880
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
If the child needs you,

881
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,320
you don't care about him.

882
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,120
When he grows up,

883
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
you won't be able to discipline him.

884
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Haichao,

885
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,800
you've cooked so many dishes.

886
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,560
What about not frying the beans?

887
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,720
Why not cook it?

888
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,480
What else can I do?

889
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,800
What I can do is cook dishes.

890
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,200
When children are

891
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,960
unhappy,

892
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,480
a meal prepared by me can make them full

893
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,880
and feel kinda happy.

894
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,400
Why do you stop me from cooking it?

895
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,960
I just wanna cook one more dish.

896
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,880
Why do you stop me?

897
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,800
Cook it. Cook it. Cook it.

898
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,560
You can cook it and I'll continue to peel the beans.

899
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,020
Do it. Do it. Cook the dish.

900
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,400
Hello.

901
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,260
Hello, Mentor.

902
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,240
Does Ling Xiao's grandmother

903
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,160
take his biological sister

904
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
to your place each time?

905
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,290
They not only come but come at the time for dinner.

906
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,840
People who come to our noodle restaurant are our regular guests.

907
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,120
She makes the people of the whole community

908
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,920
know the thing of Chen Ting.

909
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,480
She takes advantage of her seniority, doesn't she?

910
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,800
Doesn't Ling Xiao's father take care of it?

911
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,400
Ho.

912
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,600
Not to mention my Father Ling.

913
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,440
He avoids her faster than anyone else.

914
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,400
Don't marry a man

915
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,560
like my Father Ling.

916
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Not to mention the husband thing,

917
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,960
your elder brother is about to be taken away.

918
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,760
Be taken away?

919
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,600
By whom?

920
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,360
Chengzi.

921
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,000
Is she gonna take your elder brother away?

922
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,040
They are the siblings

923
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,320
who are related by flesh and blood, aren't they?

924
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,850
So what if they're related?

925
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,600
Does it mean there's a magnetic field between them?

926
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,660
They can be connected when they meet?

927
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,440
Haven't you heard about the boring

928
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,760
lifestyle news?

929
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,200
There's always a Xiaoli

930
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,600
who was abandoned

931
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,240
but tries her utmost

932
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,480
to find her biological parents.

933
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,320
When she finds them,

934
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,240
her parents will always complain tearfully

935
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,520
that they were forced to

936
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,560
abandon the child at that time.

937
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,160
But in fact,

938
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,720
they do love the child.

939
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,600
And then Xiaoli and her biological parents

940
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,360
will embrace one another and cry together.

941
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,090
Then they'll bury the hatchet.

942
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,920
My elder brother is named Ling Xiao.

943
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,250
He won't be like Xiaoli.

944
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,920
You don't get my point.

945
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,800
No matter how they were abandoned,

946
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,760
they'd like to find

947
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,920
their biological parents,

948
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,720
which means

949
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
consanguinity

950
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,840
is like a spell

951
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,880
that is magical.

952
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,840
What happened to your second brother

953
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,900
is pretty popular.

954
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Generally speaking,

955
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,960
those people will take part in some relative-seeking programs

956
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,800
when they grow up.

957
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,840
My elder brother and second brother

958
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,440
are different from someone else.

959
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,480
Our family will

960
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,260
fight against the outsiders.

961
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,640
Li Jianjian,

962
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
I do envy of you.

963
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,320
I also want a brother

964
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,240
who can both be nice to me

965
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,160
and distract

966
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
my mother.

967
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,400
Then I'll live

968
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,520
an extremely happy life

969
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,120
instead of being miserable.

970
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,200
I have to attend the tutoring class at weekends.

971
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm exhausted.

972
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't understand the

973
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,210
pain of a child from an only-child family.

974
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,200
Having a successful second marriage

975
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,520
is awesome, isn't it?

976
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,180
Look at that aged lady,

977
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,880
she's showing off all the time,

978
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,360
carrying that Chengzi.

979
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,520
Ow!

980
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Has she forgotten what happened in those years?

981
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,580
And that Chen Ting,

982
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,680
she was so cruelhearted

983
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,000
that she even abandoned

984
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,720
her own son.

985
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,560
How dare she come back?

986
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,760
When a person gets elder,

987
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,640
he'll know the importance of having his own child.

988
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,440
Not to mention

989
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,440
how well Ling Xiao studies!

990
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,040
He must have good prospects.

991
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,800
It's good for Chen Ting to get divorced.

992
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,040
She also went through a hard time then.

993
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,360
Looking at her husband and son,

994
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,040
she would think of

995
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,200
her late daughter.

996
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,480
She totally went into

997
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,640
a dead end.

998
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,720
If she hadn't got divorced and left,

999
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,960
she would

1000
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
have died.

1001
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,560
She wouldn't have been where she is now.

1002
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,400
In my opinion,

1003
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,680
only when a person

1004
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,480
can live a good life for himself,

1005
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,080
he'll be able to be a good person.

1006
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,880
Right. How could a beggar

1007
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,920
care about others' business?

1008
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,800
Even a beggar should

1009
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,040
feed his own child, shouldn't he?

1010
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,040
Am I right?

1011
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,680
Yep.

1012
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,410
That's what a mother should do.

1013
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,600
Well, it's your turn.
