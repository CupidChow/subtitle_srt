Go Ahead

Episode 3

4
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,540
Why are you dressed like this?

5
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,800
It's the first day of school.

6
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,650
I'm going there in this outfit.

7
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Doesn't it look awesome?

8
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
Absolutely!

9
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
That's right.

10
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,120
It's exactly what I want.

11
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,880
I've thought carefully about one thing.

12
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,280
In my class, I'm ranked

13
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
second from the last in terms of academic performance.

14
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,920
In order to prevent my classmates from bullying me

15
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,880
and looking down on me,

16
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,940
I've decided that,

17
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
before they do those to me,

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,740
I must strike an impression as

19
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,340
[Not to be messed with]

20
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,640
someone not to be messed with.

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
It's upside down.

22
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,690
Upside down?

23
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,440
Yep.

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
That's not important.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Not important?

26
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,480
Li Jianjian, remember this.

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
If anyone bullies you at school,

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
tell me.

29
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
I'm going to beat him down for you.

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,920
Yes!

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,760
Yes!

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Her dad just told you not to

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
stir up trouble at school with Li Jianjian.

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,960
Didn't you hear that?

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,600
Let's eat.

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,000
Where did you get that outfit?

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,120
I saved...

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,810
I saved money to buy it in the summer vacation.

39
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,920
Are you going to school

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,160
or to join a gang?

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,690
Get changed.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,490
Put on your school uniform.

43
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,680
Now!

44
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
Not to be messed with?

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,600
What a good day it is today!

46
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Jianjian.

47
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,290
Ms. Qian.

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,850
Ms. Qian.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
School starts today?

50
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,880
Yep.

51
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,720
Great. Focus on school then.

52
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,440
Set your brother Ling Xiao as example

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,760
and fight your way to the top.

54
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,440
OK.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,200
Who is Ziqiu?

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,320
I am.

57
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,020
Madam, who are you please?

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
Oh, she is

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
Zhu Peng's aunt's mother.

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,320
She's here as a postnatal care helper.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,040
Call her Ms. Zhang.

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Hi, Ms. Zhang.

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,080
Hi, Ms. Zhang.

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Good kids.

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,680
So nice.

66
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,960
Guys,

67
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,560
do you miss your mothers?

68
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Did I say anything wrong?

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Go inside please.

70
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,920
Hey.

71
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Haichao.

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,130
Are you working?

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh, you should've

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,520
told me that

75
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
you would come.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,960
I came to the city to buy some ducklings

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
and bring you some natural mountain food

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,840
by the way.

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
Oh, you really needn't

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,680
always buy me stuff when dropping by.

81
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
Where's my brother?

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
He went to buy ducklings.

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
So, he's not coming.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,840
Oh.

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,360
Yep.

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,480
OK. Please go inside and be seated.

87
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,000
OK.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,840
You haven't eaten, right?

89
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,560
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,280
I already have. Thanks.

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,720
It's just a short visit.

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Is she one of Haichao's relatives

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
from his hometown?

94
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,640
Ziqiu's second aunt.

95
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
She often comes.

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
She really doesn't know

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,530
where Ziqiu's mother went?

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
For so many years,

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,520
no one heard anything about her?

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,320
Ziqiu lost his grandparents-in-law,

101
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,000
and then

102
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,600
she disappeared.

103
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,140
She even borrowed money for leaving.

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,490
Here.

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,610
Have some water.

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,440
You can skip the hospitality, Haichao.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Um,

108
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
are Ziqiu and Jianjian at home?

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Why not ask them to come and have a chat with us?

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
School starts today.

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,160
So, they went to the school.

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,690
Today...

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
How forgetful I am!

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
It's the national schedule.

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,080
Your kid Liubao isn't going to school yet?

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,210
He graduated from junior high school.

117
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,440
But he didn't get good academic performance.

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
So, he doesn't want to attend school anymore.

119
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
He followed his third uncle to

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,240
work in Guangzhou.

121
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,200
Oh!

122
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
He goes to work so young?

123
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,130
He's not young anymore. He's 17 years old now.

124
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,760
Kids of the countryside like him

125
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,420
don't have what urban kids do.

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
Their families can't provide them much.

127
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,159
They're on their own.

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,680
If we had

129
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,160
kept raising Ziqiu,

130
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,040
he wouldn't have the chance to go to university.

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,720
Going to work would be

132
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,120
the only option for him.

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,480
We aren't having

134
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,400
the good conditions like what you mentioned either.

135
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
I just run a little noodle restaurant to

136
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,840
keep them fed.

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
You call this just keeping them fed?

138
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,760
They're drowning in abundance now.

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
You have no idea about my townspeople.

140
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
Whenever they mention this,

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
it makes me so proud.

142
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
How I wonder what kindness

143
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
my family did

144
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,020
in the previous life to

145
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,360
deserve the luck of

146
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,280
meeting a good guy

147
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,360
like you!

148
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,050
Thanks for the compliment.

149
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,600
Coming.

150
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,880
Hey, you're back.

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,200
You made boiled fish slices with hot sauce?

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,159
That flavor has spread so far

153
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,159
that I smelt it downstairs just now.

154
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,120
Man! I just added some chilies,

155
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,760
and this whole building is filled with this flavor now.

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,640
You know what? The flue

157
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,800
needs to be redesigned.

158
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,440
It'll be done soon.

159
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
People of the next community has started doing it.

160
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Need some help?

161
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
No, no, no. No need.

162
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,200
Just a soup to go.

163
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,160
You don't need to get your hands dirty for this.

164
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,640
OK. Excuse me.

165
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
My living expenses for this month.

166
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,400
Just put it here.

167
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't you want to count it?

168
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,980
What if I pay you short?

169
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,060
You can even refuse to pay.

170
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,040
I'll give you cabbage only for every meal in a month.

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,440
OK. Good for you.

172
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,170
Dad, we're back.

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,520
-Mr. Ling.
-Mr. Ling.

174
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,840
All you senior high school students came home together.

175
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,440
Now, wash your hands and eat.

176
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,480
Wow! You've made so many dishes.

177
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm starving.

178
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,150
I have something big to

179
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,400
tell you guys.

180
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,360
OK.

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,150
It's big!

182
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,789
You can do it while we eat.

183
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
You know what, Ziqiu?

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
Your Aunt He Lan came today.

185
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,690
She brought you a lot of wild duck eggs.

186
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,440
Where is she?

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
She left.

188
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
She didn't know your school

189
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
started today.

190
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
Maybe it's a good thing that I didn't meet her.

191
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to talk about.

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,080
Come on!

193
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,200
She came because she cared about you.

194
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,840
He Lan is a good person indeed,

195
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,040
but she's garrulous.

196
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,930
She loves talking about trifles with these kids.

197
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Ziqiu, you have to be a good boy.

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,400
Ziqiu, don't fight Jianjian for stuff.

199
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,080
Ziqiu,

200
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,520
you have to take care of your dad in the future.

201
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,180
I know everything about that.

202
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
Why did you get into Li Jianjian's room?

203
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,440
Nothing.

204
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,120
Jianjian, hurry up.

205
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
We're waiting for you.

206
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,060
I'm coming.

207
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
Oh! Oh!

208
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
Look at my beautiful girl!

209
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,530
What makes you so happy?

210
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
You made some friends

211
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,220
on the first day of school?

212
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Haichao,

213
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,320
look at this big family.

214
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,300
How great it is!

215
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,640
Back then,

216
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
when Jianjian's father and I

217
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,170
decided that

218
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,640
we two alone

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,680
would raise

220
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,610
the three of you,

221
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
man, no one believed

222
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,560
we could make it.

223
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
They thought that

224
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,440
two men couldn't do it,

225
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
and that there had to be a woman in the family.

226
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,960
Look.

227
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,280
How great it is now!

228
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,440
You guys grew up.

229
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,360
Look.

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't need to worry about Ling Xiao anymore.

231
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,280
I can work outside

232
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
without worrying

233
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
about the family.

234
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,370
Thank you so much, Haichao.

235
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,760
Ms. Qian still persistently

236
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,160
introduces me to ladies.

237
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,760
Why would I want to get married again?

238
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,600
I've had enough yelling.

239
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
You need a wife to

240
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,240
take good care of you.

241
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm going to announce something now.

242
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
OK, OK.

243
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
I, Li Jianjian,

244
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,400
just had

245
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,800
my first period today.

246
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
Why are you all dumbfounded?

247
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
No congratulations?

248
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,720
Congratulations.

249
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,800
Congratulations, Jianjian,

250
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,930
on your maturation.

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,130
Thank you very much.

252
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
H-Have some fish.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
The fish I made today

254
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,850
-tastes great.
-OK.

255
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,900
Have some fish.

256
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,080
During junior high school,

257
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,920
all my classmates

258
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,800
had seen their periods start,

259
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
but I hadn't gotten mine.

260
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,880
At that time, I was worried

261
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,520
if I got some sort of sickness.

262
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,960
My mother died so early that

263
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
I wondered if she had some sort of

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
genetic disease

265
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
and whether pulmonary hypertension would

266
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,920
affect my life.

267
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,720
N-No.

268
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,010
Y-You have no genetic disease.

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Jianjian, in the future,

270
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,040
if you have questions about...

271
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
…just ask.

272
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,080
Yeah. Just ask.

273
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
Ask you guys? You're all men.

274
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
You don't have periods.

275
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,520
Do you have the answer I want?

276
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,240
Oh, and,

277
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,680
my classmates said this thing

278
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
would make the belly hurt.

279
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,100
Why doesn't my belly hurt?

280
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Ling Xiao, um,

281
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,600
what did you put

282
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,500
in Jianjian's room in secret?

283
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,250
I think it was a gift.

284
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,560
A gift?

285
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,640
N-Nothing. Keep eating.

286
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
Just check it out. Go ahead.

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,330
Check it out.

288
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Go ahead.

289
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,360
He gave me

290
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,580
a piece of clothes,

291
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
with white lace edges!

292
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,360
It's so beautiful.

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
I-I'm covered in sweat.

294
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,840
I need to get changed.

295
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,400
OK. Go ahead.

296
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,300
I'm going to the bathroom.

297
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,440
They're playing with my ball.

298
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,570
I need to get it back.

299
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
I'm going to try it on in my room

300
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,480
Go, go ahead.

301
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,640
Y-You stay.

302
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,760
Come here.

303
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Oh, my girl.

304
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,960
Jianjian, in the future,

305
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
when you talk about this,

306
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,280
don't share it with other people.

307
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm not sharing it with other people.

308
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,520
They're family.

309
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,560
Family...

310
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,180
Well, what should I do?

311
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,600
OK. Thanks.

312
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,040
Haichao,

313
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,890
what can I help you with?

314
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,880
I need you to

315
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,010
teach me something.

316
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,720
We're friends.

317
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
Don't say "teach."

318
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,960
What's it?

319
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I'd like to ask...

320
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,960
Look at you.

321
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
Have an orange.

322
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,250
OK, OK. Just put it here.

323
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,280
You're being shy?

324
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,440
So, you're fancying someone

325
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,960
and want me to introduce you to her?

326
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
No, no, no.

327
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
It's about Jianjian.

328
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,290
What's wrong about her?

329
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,040
Look. Um.

330
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,240
I've been treating Jianjian

331
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,770
as a little girl.

332
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,960
But, in the blink of an eye,

333
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,680
she turned 16.

334
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,560
She just told me

335
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
she had her first period.

336
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,970
My goodness.

337
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,520
She just had it?

338
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,240
That came a bit late.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,720
Yeah.

340
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,560
Sh-She just asked me

341
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
if it came so late

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
because her mother

343
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
had some sort of genetic disease.

344
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,360
Could it come late because of that?

345
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,960
D-Do things like that happen?

346
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,240
No! It has nothing to do

347
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,880
with genetic diseases.

348
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,840
Some girls' periods start early, some late.

349
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,320
But it means she's healthy if her period has started.

350
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,480
Oh, well,

351
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
you men

352
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,160
are really careless.

353
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,520
Raising a girl is completely different

354
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,720
from raising a boy.

355
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
It takes a lot of care to raise a girl.

356
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,760
If you had listened to me

357
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,360
and let me introduce you a girlfriend,

358
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,320
would you have become

359
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,080
like this? Oh man!

360
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,800
L-Let's not talk about this.

361
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
How about this?

362
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,280
This weekend,

363
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,440
when your daughter

364
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,840
Fang has free time,

365
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,560
see if she can help Jianjian

366
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,040
buy some... that sort of...

367
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,920
underwear for girls.

368
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,880
You mean bras?

369
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes.

370
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,720
Oh, Haichao, my friend!

371
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,400
Jianjian is 16 years old now.

372
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,770
But you still let her wear small vests?

373
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,600
You're so careless

374
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,760
as a father.

375
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,920
Oh, come on!

376
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,040
Well, I didn't realize it.

377
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,320
Well, a girl without her mother

378
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,640
is so poor.

379
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,520
Oh, your daughter Jianjian

380
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,380
doesn't behave like a girl at all.

381
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,840
She always

382
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,240
stays with her brothers,

383
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,800
acting like a monkey.

384
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
If you give her a stick,

385
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,580
she might think she's Monkey King and go to challenge gods.

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,760
Excuse me!

387
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,520
Which class are you from?

388
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,240
You can't just open the door of the broadcasting room and get in.

389
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
Please. It's an emergency!

390
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,080
Announcement! Announcement!

391
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
Li Ling Xiao of Grade 12 Class 1,

392
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Li Ling Xiao of Grade 12 Class 1,

393
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,280
your sister went to the park behind the school

394
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,800
trying to help someone in trouble.

395
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,400
You sister went to the park behind the school

396
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,920
trying to help someone in trouble.

397
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,320
Please go to her immediately.

398
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,980
Please go to her immediately.

399
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,040
Li Ling Xiao?

400
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,160
Just call whoever you want.

401
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,520
Even if you get your principal here,

402
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,920
since you knocked this to the ground,

403
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,200
you still must pay for it.

404
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,760
You're just

405
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
wasting our time!

406
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
This is imported medicine.

407
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,920
It's very hard to get.

408
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,000
She said it many times.

409
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,280
You bumped into her first.

410
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,410
She didn't bump into you. Understand?

411
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,880
Sorry,

412
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,800
I really don't have that much money.

413
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,400
Shut up!

414
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Check this.

415
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
This is the receipt

416
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,280
the pharmacy gave us

417
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
when we bought it.

418
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
It's over 1,000 yuan.

419
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,450
There's the label on it.

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,400
Don't show me

421
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,240
this nonsense.

422
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,920
First,

423
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I have no way to verify

424
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,800
the authenticity of it.

425
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,260
Second,

426
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
even if it's real,

427
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,080
I can't verify

428
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
the authenticity of the medicine.

429
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,160
So, you just want to deny your liability,

430
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,640
do you?

431
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I'm telling you this.

432
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,560
My sister went to the Teaching Affairs Office to

433
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,160
ask for the teachers' help.

434
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
If you insist,

435
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
when the teachers come,

436
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,000
make yourselves clear.

437
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,840
Don't be mad. They're just students.

438
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,640
And the girl didn't mean to do it.

439
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,600
Maybe we should forget it.

440
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,640
Let's accept it as bad luck.

441
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,440
No, I can't.

442
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
Our money for the medicine didn't just

443
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,460
come from nothing.

444
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,400
Look.

445
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,360
We've wasted

446
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,490
almost half an hour.

447
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,240
Little girl,

448
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,320
you didn't mean to bump into us.

449
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,920
Look.

450
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
You two put all your money together.

451
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,109
Give us as much as you can.

452
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,000
And we'll just accept it as bad luck.

453
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,720
Are you kidding me?

454
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,349
OK. I'll pay you.

455
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,400
Come on!

456
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Are you crazy?

457
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,520
These two are obviously swindlers.

458
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Why are you going to pay them?

459
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,680
You didn't bump into us.

460
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't want to talk to you.

461
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,490
Don't touch her.

462
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:20,920
How dare you!

463
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
You want to try my rage?

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,589
No violence! No violence!

465
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,069
I'll pay.

466
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,730
Step aside.

467
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,720
Second brother!

468
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't touch my second brother!

469
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,240
Li Jianjian!

470
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,280
Stay back.

471
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,980
Bring it on!

472
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,560
The police are here. Arrest these two people.

473
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,680
You two,

474
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,800
don't ever run!

475
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,400
Bring it on!

476
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:15,920
Stop!

477
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,650
Li Jianjian!

478
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,200
Li Jianjian, just stop

479
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,280
jumping around!

480
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,520
I told you to get the teachers from the Teaching Affairs Office.

481
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,800
Why did you get Ling Xiao?

482
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,660
I went there. But no one was there.

483
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,360
Why did you hit me?

484
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,720
Are you going to marry me if you break my brain?

485
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,200
Marry you? You think I'm crazy?

486
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,880
You think this is helping people?

487
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,280
What if they had weapons?

488
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
What if they had weapons?

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,060
What if they had...

490
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,080
I thought you have called the police!

491
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,800
I came as soon as I heard the broadcast.

492
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,860
How could I do that?

493
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,800
This is driving me mad.

494
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,960
They ran away!

495
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,080
Alright.

496
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Let's call it an end.

497
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,610
Remember to call the police next time.

498
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,530
Li Jianjian,

499
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,360
let's go.

500
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,040
Let's go.

501
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,040
Come on.

502
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,320
Although it's good that you are

503
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,920
ready to help those in need,

504
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
what if

505
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
your opponent had a bat or a knife?

506
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
What would you do?

507
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,280
Are students like you,

508
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,010
prepared for a fight like that?

509
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,400
I went to the Teaching Affairs Office, but no one was there.

510
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,880
But you even thought of broadcasting

511
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,480
to ask your brother for help?

512
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,890
Didn't you think of calling for a teacher?

513
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,040
Sir, I was trying to do something good.

514
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,320
It was a good thing,

515
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,580
but I can't commend how you went about it.

516
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,200
When your class teacher gets here

517
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
and takes you back,

518
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,330
you need to consider what you've done.

519
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,400
If there was no one in the Teaching Affairs Office,

520
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,800
why didn't you call security?

521
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,600
Alright, stop having a go at her.

522
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,360
She did think of using the broadcaster to find me,

523
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,890
which is a big improvement.

524
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,640
So...

525
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,720
Thanks for your help.

526
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,360
It's all my fault.

527
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
You're all getting punished because of me.

528
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm in the same class as Li Jianjian.

529
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,160
My name's Qi Mingyue.

530
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,180
She's your classmate?

531
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,210
I don't know her.

532
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,280
Huh?

533
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
I'm the class president.

534
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,160
Oh, I didn't notice that.

535
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,040
Sorry.

536
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
Then why did the three of you

537
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,880
help me?

538
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
A sense of duty.

539
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,010
She's left her bag lying around again.

540
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,200
Li Jianjian!

541
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,880
Li Jianjian.

542
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
Oh, class president.

543
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,800
You helped me last time,

544
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,530
so can I treat you to dinner?

545
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,360
I want to have ice-cream.

546
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
OK.

547
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
There's a new Haagen-Dazs

548
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,400
opened near school.

549
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,780
When will we go?

550
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,200
Do you have time now?

551
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,740
[Icy summer Ice cream]

552
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,210
You don't mind that I brought my brothers, do you?

553
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,080
No.

554
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,800
It's my fault.

555
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,720
You helped me out so much,

556
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
and I forgot to even invite

557
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
your brothers.

558
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,000
It's fine.

559
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,280
Let me introduce you.

560
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,240
This is my eldest brother Ling Xiao

561
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,720
and this is my second brother, He Ziqiu.

562
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,640
This is Qi Mingyue.

563
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
This is the president of my class.

564
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,010
You all know each other now.

565
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,480
Are you cousins?

566
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,240
No.

567
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,160
We're all from the same family.

568
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,520
Same mother but different fathers?

569
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,920
Different fathers and different mothers.

570
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,120
Then you're not related?

571
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,280
Of course we are.

572
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,000
They are my brothers.

573
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Oh.

574
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,600
Ling Xiao, Ziqiu, take a look.

575
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,280
What do you want?

576
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,940
You choose.

577
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,640
We'll pay for our own.

578
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,560
No need.

579
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,840
I said I'd treat you.

580
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,800
You're so good.

581
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,300
Then I'll help myself.

582
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,600
Have you got enough money?

583
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
I've got 500.

584
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,760
Order whatever you want.

585
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,490
Then I really will help myself.

586
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,560
Excuse me, order.

587
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,560
Hello.

588
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,400
I want this, this and this.

589
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,200
Yes. OK.

590
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,970
What would you like?

591
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,250
Which would you recommend?

592
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,520
This vanilla flavor is the best.

593
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,000
OK. Then I'll have this.

594
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Yes. OK.

595
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
Heh-heh-heh!

596
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,520
Wow!

597
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,080
A mix of flavors.

598
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,440
Do you have enough?

599
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
Enough. Enough.

600
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,960
Try this tea flavor.

601
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,080
It's good too.

602
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,960
Wow, the vanilla is not bad.

603
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,240
Then I'll try some.

604
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,920
Eat up. It'll melt.

605
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,480
Is it good?

606
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
There are so many students.

607
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,080
Actually, according to her results,

608
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,640
she could have done even better.

609
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
She must have made some mistake

610
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,800
this time.

611
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,850
She's always been good at her studies.

612
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,760
Right.

613
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
What kind of parents' meeting was that?

614
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
It was more like a public denouncement

615
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,770
for backward students.

616
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,960
I mean, there are over 30 students in a class.

617
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,800
So where there are good students,

618
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,240
there are always going to be ones that don't do as well.

619
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,570
It's just a natural law.

620
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,560
One of your brothers has good scores,

621
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,240
and the other brother's scores aren't bad either.

622
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,300
Doesn't your dad tell you off at home?

623
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,760
My dad really doesn't have any expectations of me.

624
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,560
All he cares about is that I don't get into trouble.

625
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,120
Your dad's great.

626
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
My mom's really strict with me.

627
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,080
If my scores drop out

628
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,320
of the top five in the class,

629
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
I'll be in serious trouble.

630
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,860
Your mom will beat you?

631
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,600
I wish she would.

632
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,800
Is your mom here?

633
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,200
Yeah.

634
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,480
Which is your mom?

635
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,010
The one sitting over there.

636
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,560
It's like a princess of England

637
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,220
being received by commoners.

638
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,000
That's my dad.

639
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,960
Dad!

640
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,280
This is my friend, Qi Mingyue.

641
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,120
Hello.

642
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,840
So you are Mingyue?

643
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,180
Jianjian always talks about you.

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Look at her.

645
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
She's not just good at her studies,

646
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,960
she's pretty too.

647
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,040
About the same as me.

648
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Thank you.

649
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,280
Mingyue.

650
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,760
Oh, hello.

651
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
May I ask whose father you are?

652
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,520
Hello, I'm Li Jianjian's father.

653
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,080
Li Jianjian's father?

654
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,640
Hello, I'm Li Jianjian.

655
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,200
Mingyue.

656
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
I'll take you to meet someone else.

657
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,880
Excuse me.

658
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,120
Yajie.

659
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,560
Oh, hello.

660
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,480
Long time no see.

661
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,960
Hello.

662
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,520
Hello.

663
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,240
Sit. Take a seat. No need for pleasantries.

664
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
Is this your mom?

665
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,560
Hello. Hello.

666
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
She's so pretty.

667
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,160
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,760
Your daughter is so smart.

669
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,200
She came top again.

670
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,960
Who's that kid?

671
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,720
She's the best student in our class.

672
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,880
She's called Wang, Wang something Jie.

673
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,040
Oh, sh-she's studied so hard her eyesight's ruined.

674
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,440
Her glasses are so thick.

675
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,640
Don't say that.

676
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
What if it's a hereditary ailment?

677
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,280
Honestly, your child is so...

678
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,520
I really envy you.

679
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,240
But...

680
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,080
Her mom isn't wearing glasses.

681
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,580
She might have gotten it from her father.

682
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,920
Hello, everybody.

683
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,800
Hello.

684
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,360
Let me introduce myself.

685
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
I am Mr. Huang.

686
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,500
I am Grade 10 Class 6's class teacher.

687
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,600
Thank you. Thank you.

688
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,720
Today,

689
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
this is the first parents' meeting we've had

690
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
since the trial entrance examinations.

691
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
I think we should all get to know one another.

692
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,240
So,

693
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
where are

694
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,900
Wang Yajie's parents?

695
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,520
Wang Yajie

696
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,520
came top in our class

697
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,780
in the placement test.

698
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,280
Yajie's mother

699
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,120
do you have any educational advice

700
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,450
to share with everyone?

701
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,880
Not really.

702
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,000
The main thing is that my daughter is aware of how important her studies are

703
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,480
and she has good teachers.

704
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,320
You're too kind. Please sit.

705
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,320
Only a very small part

706
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,320
of a child's scores is down to

707
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,200
what happens in class.

708
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,160
The main part

709
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,200
takes place

710
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,120
away from the classroom.

711
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,640
Where are Qi Mingyue's parents?

712
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Hello, everyone.

713
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,680
I am Qi Mingyue's mother.

714
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,200
My name is Jin Yuxiang.

715
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
Our family attaches great importance

716
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,320
to our child's education.

717
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,080
Right now,

718
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
I would like to share our experience

719
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,440
with everyone.

720
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,440
And it's

721
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,640
that she has every material thing she needs,

722
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,680
and when it comes to education,

723
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,520
you cannot go easy on your children.

724
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,440
Children very rarely

725
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,720
have the self-motivation to study themselves,

726
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,360
so

727
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,160
you mustn't let your guard down.

728
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
As parents,

729
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,560
we must supervise our children,

730
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,640
and make sure they establish

731
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,120
a positive set of values

732
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,240
and

733
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,360
have incredibly clear

734
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,560
goals for the future.

735
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,320
So that they know

736
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,720
what they want to become.

737
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,620
Do you think Mingyue's mom

738
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,760
looks like her daughter

739
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,680
has gotten into Peking University

740
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
and is sharing her experience of it.

741
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,160
She's making a lot of sense.

742
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,170
Either way, let me tell you.

743
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Senior high school teachers say the same thing

744
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,360
as junior high school teachers.

745
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,760
They just say the same thing using different words.

746
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,880
If in a bit

747
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,040
they announce that they're going to use torture,

748
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
then just put up with it

749
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,900
and I'll give you a foot massage when we get home.

750
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,520
You don't have to do that.

751
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Just wash your own

752
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,840
smelly socks.

753
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,520
Don't always get your second brother to wash them.

754
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,320
He's willing to do it.

755
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
I don't force him.

756
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,520
But you let him do it.

757
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,520
That's about all I've got to say.

758
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,420
So finally,

759
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,080
I'd just like

760
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
to sincerely thank

761
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
the class teacher of this class,

762
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,360
Mr. Huang, and all the other teachers

763
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,400
for the

764
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,080
hard and selfless work they do in helping raise our children.

765
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,210
Thank you very much.

766
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,960
They even got crusty.

767
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
You're the one with smelly socks. We're the same.

768
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
Li jianjian.

769
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,780
What's making you so excited?

770
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,520
So,

771
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,970
is that your father beside you?

772
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,640
Hello.

773
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,480
Hello, everybody.

774
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,680
I am Jianjian's father.

775
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,960
My kid's

776
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,000
naughty.

777
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,170
Sorry she gives you a hard time.

778
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,850
Jianjian's father,

779
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,960
does Jianjian attend art classes

780
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,520
every weekend?

781
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,440
Yes.

782
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,240
She does.

783
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,840
Are you hoping

784
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,080
that she will specialize

785
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,740
in the arts?

786
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,800
Well.

787
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,800
I hadn't thought too far ahead about it.

788
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,680
She just liked drawing when she was little,

789
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,360
so I told her

790
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,800
to go ahead.

791
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,320
You need to take advantage of the time you have

792
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,440
to study hard.

793
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
If in the future,

794
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,200
she wants to specialize

795
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,960
in the arts,

796
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,520
then in the next semester of Grade 11,

797
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,960
we will make joint arrangements.

798
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,040
No, Mr. Huang.

799
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,080
An interlude.

800
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,760
An interlude.

801
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,760
Where are

802
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,960
Fang Lele's parents?

803
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,640
An interlude. An interlude. Ha-ha!

804
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,960
Let's carry on.

805
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,840
The parents of the student who came third.

806
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,170
The parents of the student who came third.

807
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,170
Was it really that over the top?

808
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,360
If you were your teacher,

809
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,160
would you want your students to do well and be good,

810
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
or be bad and making trouble

811
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,960
every day?

812
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,600
It's understandable.

813
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
An interlude. An interlude.

814
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Do your homework, do your homework.

815
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,800
What else did he say about Dad?

816
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,640
I don't know.

817
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,400
He just asked the parents of the top five students

818
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,520
to share their experience,

819
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,240
and then asked all the students

820
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,880
to leave.

821
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,000
Jeez!

822
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,120
What is this?

823
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,680
A love letter?

824
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Hey, why did you rip it up?

825
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,920
Who wrote it?

826
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,250
I don't know.

827
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,680
That's right.

828
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,240
You should just concentrate on your studies.

829
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,920
You shouldn't let worldly affairs

830
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,240
get in the way.

831
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,240
You know what he's like.

832
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,600
He's overly sensitive when it comes to women.

833
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,400
If a woman just raises her voice

834
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
a little bit,

835
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,290
he gets annoyed.

836
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,200
Aren't you sensitive?

837
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,040
There are cheerleaders on the basketball court.

838
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,960
That's different.

839
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,680
They're screaming out.

840
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Who can take that?

841
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,050
Second brother,

842
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,320
I know you like quiet and gentle girls,

843
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
but you have to remember

844
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,240
that you came into our family

845
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,080
on the female side.

846
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,840
So you should

847
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,220
stand up for yourself.

848
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,160
You and Ling Xiao vowed for that.

849
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,720
Don't rely on me all the time.

850
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,640
Vowed?

851
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,200
Yeah.

852
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,840
I wanted to take his dad as my adopted father,

853
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
and him as my brother.

854
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,000
Then he suddenly

855
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
got on his knees and asked me to marry him.

856
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
And then we

857
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,900
had a child betrothal.

858
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,760
Do your homework.

859
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,180
Why are you drinking mine?

860
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
If you drink mine, what will I drink?

861
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,000
Sorry.

862
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,730
I'll go and buy you another one.

863
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
You're being out of order.

864
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,240
She was.

865
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,930
When you've got good students,

866
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,260
you're going to get ones that aren't so good.

867
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,480
Not being great at your studies isn't the worst thing.

868
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,760
Not being great

869
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,960
but thinking you're great is way worse.

870
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,600
So you...you

871
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,800
should just do your best, OK?

872
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,060
If you really can't improve, then don't worry about it.

873
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,440
Having such an understanding father

874
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,360
like you,

875
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
really is

876
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
so amazing.

877
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,220
Come, cheers. A toast!

878
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
No need. No need.

879
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
All I ask is that when the time comes,

880
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,240
when you go out begging,

881
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,370
don't tell anyone you're my daughter.

882
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Don't come around to ours,

883
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,500
we won't have any food for you.

884
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
How can you be

885
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
so cold-hearted?

886
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,160
Don't worry, Li Jianjian,

887
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,290
your second brother

888
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,260
will save some leftovers for you.

889
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,440
Alright, alright, quit messing about.

890
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,280
Eat up.

891
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,320
Are you OK? Have you got toothache again?

892
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,840
Open your mouth, I'll take a look.

893
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,570
I've looked, my gum's swollen.

894
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,480
OK. I'll take you to have it seen

895
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,120
on the weekend.

896
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm not going.

897
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
You said that last year.

898
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,480
Have you forgotten

899
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,560
that you were rolling around in pain on the floor?

900
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm not going.

901
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,760
You have to go.

902
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
I won't!

903
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
Do as you're told.

904
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,680
We're eating.

905
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,000
Don't tell the kids off while we're eating.

906
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,480
When did you pick up this bad habit?

907
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,120
Honestly.

908
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Jianjian.

909
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,120
If you've got toothache,

910
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,800
don't eat meat and whatnot.

911
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,240
You should eat more greens.

912
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
Eat more light stuff.

913
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Otherwise you'll aggravate the inflammation.

914
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,199
Have some greens.

915
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
Thanks.

916
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,699
Who's calling at a time like this?

917
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,710
Who else could it be?

918
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,710
It's the station.

919
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,560
Ling Xiao's grandma.

920
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,280
Jeez!

921
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,800
Yes.

922
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
Quit beating around the bush.

923
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,929
Just come out and say it.

924
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,800
OK.

925
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,600
Oh, that's good.

926
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,770
Have a prawn.

927
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Mr. Li. Enjoy your dinner.

928
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,090
I'm going upstairs.

929
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Hang on, you've hardly eaten anything.

930
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,520
Have some more.

931
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,040
Every time

932
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,320
he hears his grandma or someone else on her side

933
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,640
is calling,

934
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,000
he doesn't want to eat.

935
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,840
His mother really does hang around like a bad smell.

936
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,880
She's left and gone to Singapore

937
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,640
and she's never here.

938
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,600
She really knows how to make her presence felt.

939
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,520
She's rich.

940
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,120
So she wants to stay relevant.

941
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
Enough. Enough.

942
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,920
Let's drop it.

943
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,640
You two

944
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,960
should be careful

945
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,720
what you say to your brother in future.

946
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,450
Understood?

947
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,660
OK. I'll make some noodles in a bit

948
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,360
and you can take them up to him, Jianjian.

949
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,200
Fine.

950
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,360
He's not even old and I still have to serve him.

951
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,680
Just do it.

952
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,680
When he is old,

953
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,340
he won't need you to serve him.

954
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,810
OK, I'll pass it on to Ling Xiao.

955
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,240
Um,

956
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,080
well,

957
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,800
Ling Xiao,

958
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,960
he's busy with something all of a sudden and has left.

959
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,600
When he comes back,

960
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,930
I'll get him to call you.

961
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,000
OK.

962
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,520
Yeah. I'll be going. Bye.

963
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,120
It's all your fault!

964
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,320
He never calls his grandma,

965
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,520
and that's fine.

966
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,360
But now, see?

967
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,160
He won't even answer her calls.

968
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,620
Can't you be reasonable?!

969
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,360
When Ling Xiao hears

970
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,080
anything about his mom,

971
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,320
he doesn't even have the appetite to eat,

972
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,160
why is that?

973
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
It's all because when you and Chen Ting argued back then

974
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,600
you wouldn't even consider his feelings.

975
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,720
Do you know

976
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,520
how much of a psychological influence it has had on him?

977
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,560
I'm telling you, kids these days

978
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,480
are delicate.

979
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,040
Ling Xiao isn't like you.

980
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,960
You, you're thick-skinned.

981
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,840
You don't have feelings.

982
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,170
That's better than you.

983
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,600
For a man of the family

984
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,960
to be so indecisive,

985
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,160
such a push-over,

986
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
such a push-over.

987
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,280
I'm a push over?

988
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm indecisive?

989
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,520
Then don't eat the food I cooked.

990
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:35,840
Don't eat.

991
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,400
Alright. Alright.

992
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,080
Why can't I?

993
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,040
What are you eating? I made this.

994
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,400
Don't eat.

995
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,240
Enough!

996
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,940
Li Haichao, Ling Heping, enough!

997
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,640
Stop with the personal abuse.

998
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,840
Are you eating or not？

999
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Yes, yes.

1000
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,840
So what

1001
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,040
did she call you for?

1002
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,520
Nothing.

1003
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,600
She just hadn't

1004
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,400
called for a while.

1005
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,560
She wanted to talk with

1006
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,360
Ling Xiao.

1007
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
Don't eat. You're not allowed.

1008
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,000
You're so petty.

1009
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,040
Yes, I am.

1010
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,080
OK. OK. Let's drink. Let's drink.

1011
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,680
You're really winding me up.

1012
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
I'll get you some water.

1013
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
I don't want any. I've got toothache.

1014
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,440
I mean, maybe

1015
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,300
I'll die someday just because you are too annoying.

1016
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,320
Have you done all the washing up?

1017
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,610
Does your shoulder still hurt?

1018
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,210
I'll give you a massage.

1019
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,480
Drop this act.

1020
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,080
Tell me.

1021
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,120
What

1022
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
did she want?

1023
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,820
Of course something was up if she phoned.

1024
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,300
She said that Chen Ting's husband

1025
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
was going to come over and work for half a year.

1026
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,880
And Chen Ting

1027
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,320
was going to bring her daughter with her.

1028
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
She wanted my help

1029
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,090
finding a school to study at on a temporary basis.

1030
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
That old woman really is something.

1031
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,560
Chen Ting should have come to you herself

1032
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,720
with this.

1033
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,040
You and Ling Xiao

1034
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,360
don't have anything to do with her.

1035
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,890
She really doesn't consider you an outsider.

1036
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What should I say to Chen Ting

1037
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,280
on the phone.

1038
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
It's his grandma.

1039
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,200
Ling Xiao's own grandma.

1040
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,280
You can't

1041
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,410
just go ignoring their relationship.

1042
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,840
You're right.

1043
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,400
So did you tell Ling Xiao?

1044
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
I don't even have

1045
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,200
anything to say to Chen Ting,

1046
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,880
so what does he have

1047
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,200
to say to him?

1048
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,880
Forget it.

1049
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,960
It's not worth telling him.

1050
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,440
Yeah.

1051
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,640
Take it back.

1052
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,980
I'm not hungry.

1053
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,320
Have some.

1054
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,000
Dad put two

1055
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,060
poached eggs in it.

1056
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,450
I've already brushed my teeth.

1057
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,420
I'm not hungry.

1058
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Your mom...

1059
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,000
I mean Chen Ting…

1060
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,290
Ouch, why can't I talk about it?

1061
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,120
His mom left

1062
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,800
after they got divorced.

1063
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
What about my mom?

1064
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,960
She just left us.

1065
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,000
It's not that you can't talk about it. There's just no need.

1066
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm a stranger to her now.

1067
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,900
I don't want to hear about her.

1068
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,240
That's right.

1069
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,360
Right my ass.

1070
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,560
I'm telling you,

1071
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,520
be careful that your mom doesn't

1072
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
ask for your weight in fat one day to repay her favor of giving birth to you.

1073
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,250
Then I'll lose five pounds, OK?

1074
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,160
Bro,

1075
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,820
you weighed only five pounds when you were born?

1076
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,800
What's up?

1077
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,800
It hurts.

1078
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,730
Don't move. Let me look.

1079
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,520
It's not tooth decay.

1080
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,680
I guess it's your wisdom tooth getting stuck below the surface of your gums.

1081
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,610
So it's swollen.

1082
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
What could you see from that?

1083
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
Don't trust this quack doctor.

1084
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,040
Let me see.

1085
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,280
Ow!

1086
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,500
Stupid people should study hard.

1087
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
Get Mr. Li to get you some anti-inflammatory drugs.

1088
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,760
Brush your teeth properly.

1089
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Yeah.

1090
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,400
Go back.

1091
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,600
I want to sleep.

1092
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,130
Let's go.

1093
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,680
No.

1094
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,120
Not unless

1095
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,380
you eat those two eggs.

1096
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,360
Li Jianjian,

1097
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,680
get off my bed.

1098
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,210
No. Not unless you eat them.

1099
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,170
Come on, master.

1100
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,840
Eat up.

1101
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,040
Bro,

1102
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,800
your comforter

1103
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,730
smells like you.

1104
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,050
It smells great!

1105
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
How many times have I told you

1106
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,160
not to get into Ziqiu's or my bed?

1107
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,890
Understood?

1108
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,640
Why are you so stingy?!

1109
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,050
If you do, I'll beat you!

1110
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,800
Fine, I won't.

1111
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,720
Who cares?!

1112
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,980
Is there gold in there?

1113
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,440
You're mad!

1114
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,410
Starve to death!

1115
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
Why did you have a go at her?

1116
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
She's still a kid.

1117
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,680
She's sixteen.

1118
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,560
Fine.

1119
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,440
When we get back from now on,

1120
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,840
we'll all lock our doors.

1121
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,360
Go to bed.
