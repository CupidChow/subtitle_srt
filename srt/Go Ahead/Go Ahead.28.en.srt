[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 28

4
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,800
Jianjian,

5
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
you are still staying up so late?

6
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Jianjian, speak.

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,160
Dad.

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,440
What's wrong?

9
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,880
Why are you so low-spirited?

10
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,200
It's like you're dying.

11
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,680
I took a hit.

12
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
Tell me. What happened?

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,079
Well...

14
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Well...

15
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,440
I can't tell you now.

16
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
I'll tell you later.

17
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,000
You're keeping it secret from me?

18
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,079
Then why did you call me?

19
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,520
I need to be encouraged to face it.

20
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
I need you to cheer me on

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,040
like refueling a car with gas.

22
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
You need me to

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
refuel your car?

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Don't you

25
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,240
run a gas station yourself?

26
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,040
Doesn’t our whole family

27
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,960
always go to your place to refuel?

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,280
My gas station is running out of gas now.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
Really?

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,720
It has moments when it runs out of gas?

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,000
OK. Wait a moment.

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
I'll call someone now.

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,040
Is it a gas company?

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm Li Haichao.

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,640
I need you to do me a little favor.

36
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
My daughter's gas station is

37
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,800
out of gas.

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
Assign some to her.

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
How much can you give her?

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,360
Five trucks? That's too little.

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
Give her 50 trucks of it at least.

42
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,520
When can it be delivered?

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,840
OK, tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,560
Thanks.

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,440
Come to my restaurant and enjoy my noodles when you have time.

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,800
OK.

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,200
Jianjian, did you hear that?

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
It's taken care of.

49
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Your gas will be full when you open your eyes

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,040
tomorrow morning.

51
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,800
Thank you, Dad.

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,880
You're welcome.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,920
Dad.

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,829
Sorry.

55
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,200
How can it get to the point of saying sorry?

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Tell me about it.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,160
I just think that you haven't got married

58
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
because you want to take care of me.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,280
It has nothing to do with you that

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,600
I haven't got married.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,680
Besides,

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,560
haven't I tried to

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
get along with Ziqiu's mom?

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,240
You still can't forget Aunt He Mei?

65
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,840
Not like that.

66
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,840
I got the three of you afterward.

67
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,360
I got the three of you,

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,680
so, no one would introduce anyone to me.

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,280
So, you do

70
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
want one yourself, right?

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,159
I don't.

72
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
Tell me the truth.

73
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,320
The truth is I don't want one.

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:03,960
Over the years,

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Mr. Ling and I

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,680
have lived a pretty good life together.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,520
I've discussed it with him.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,720
When we can't work anymore in the future,

79
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,280
we will go

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
to a nursing home together.

81
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,600
Nursing home?

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,720
Do you think it's so easy to

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,760
get in a nursing home?

84
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,480
They need descendants' signatures.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
Then what?

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,240
When the time comes,

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
I will have to ask you to

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,560
sign for me?

89
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,120
I won't sign.

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
In the future,

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,760
I will live with you

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,040
and take care of you.

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
It is still uncertain if you'll take care of me or the other way around.

94
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,120
Think about it.

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,560
With you like this,

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
if you have your child,

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,960
who is naughtier than you,

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
should I help you with parenting?

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Maybe not.

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,760
I'd choose to go to the nursing home

101
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,640
to enjoy the happiness of leisure.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,280
Well, yeah.

103
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,960
Alright.

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
Stop speculating the future.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
Just go to bed.

106
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,280
Bye.

107
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
Wait. One more thing.

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Hurry.

109
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,480
Dad, I love you. Good night.

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,560
♫Thinking of the first time that I held your hand♫

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,480
♫You held me so tight as if I was everything to you♫

112
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,080
♫One grows bigger over time♫

113
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,520
♫And the other gets smaller♫

114
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,280
♫Time brings us♫

115
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Don't eat spicy

116
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
or strongly flavored food

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,040
in these days.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
If you have a toothache,

119
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,320
you can eat ice cream.

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Come to have the stitches removed three days later.

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
OK, thank you, doctor.

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,360
Song, show the patient where to get the medicine.

123
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,280
OK.

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,800
What brings you here?

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
I want to treat you to lunch.

126
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,600
I've been waiting for you

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
for more than an hour.

128
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,120
Go! Go!

129
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Wait a second.

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
Hurry up.

131
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,280
Come on. Hurry.

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,720
Why don't you eat?

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,640
Eat!

134
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Go ahead.

135
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
Do you have anything to talk to me?

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,520
No.

137
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,080
Eat.

138
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,080
Then we'll go back to work.

139
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
I have a lot to do in the studio this afternoon.

140
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,200
You came over at noon

141
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,320
just to eat with me?

142
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Or else?

143
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,240
From now on, every day, as long as I have time,

144
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,320
I will come to eat with you.

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,280
In the afternoon,

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,720
I'll try to finish work early

147
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,800
to go home with you.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
You don't need to go to my place for me.

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Come on.

150
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll accompany you to take a taxi first.

151
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,080
No need.

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
It's so close.

153
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
I can walk back.

154
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
You can go back now.

155
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
What's wrong?

156
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,320
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

157
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,200
Don't you want me to pity you?

158
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
I am pitying you now.

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
When you are alone,

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
you'll always lose yourself in your thoughts.

161
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,640
Don't think so much.

162
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,960
Why should you?

163
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
Put all that intelligence

164
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,720
into the right place.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,960
You can as well

166
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
see more patients.

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Don't worry.

168
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,040
I'll take pity on you

169
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
as much as I can.

170
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
I'll pity you till you feel that

171
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,920
you don't need it anymore.

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,320
Then I will continue to pity you,

173
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,360
because I just like to

174
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
pity someone.

175
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,240
OK?

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,920
Are you still mad?

177
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,520
No.

178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,000
You even cried yesterday.

179
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
No, I didn't.

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,680
OK. You didn't.

181
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
That was just a puppy peeing.

182
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
What puppy?

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
See you. I'll go to your place this evening.

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,520
No need.

185
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,000
Dad called me

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,680
and asked me to

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
accompany him to see a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctor in the evening.

188
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,120
Why is he going to see a TCM doctor again?

189
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,520
He said he doesn’t feel well.

190
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,080
OK. Approved.

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,680
Go ahead.

192
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
Why are you so tall?

193
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
♫Like a breeze♫

194
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,280
♫A breeze with words to say♫

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,680
♫I see♫

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,320
♫Actually♫

197
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
♫I'm in love more than I think♫

198
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,520
Bye.

199
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,560
♫Realize, realize♫

200
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,960
♫Everything around me♫

201
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,240
♫Is love♫

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,080
I had a police duty call when I was about to leave.

203
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
It kept me busy.

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,880
What time does the traditional Chinese medicine clinic close today?

205
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,440
Are we late?

206
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,160
No.

207
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,680
The doctor is my friend.

208
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,280
And the clinic belongs to him.

209
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,360
I just called.

210
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,320
He's waiting for us.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,440
Dad.

212
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
What is your ailment?

213
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
How about going to the hospital for a physical examination?

214
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,640
No need.

215
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,160
The physical examination that my unit just bought for me last month

216
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
found nothing wrong.

217
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,320
But recently,

218
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
for some reason,

219
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,080
I feel uncomfortable all over my body.

220
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,760
Sometimes, you have to try traditional Chinese medicine.

221
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,200
Give it some credit.

222
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,600
Let's go.

223
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,760
Nothing is wrong.

224
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,640
It's hot recently,

225
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
and your spleen and stomach are weakened.

226
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll prescribe you sanfutie

227
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,800
(medicated patches placed on acupuncture points on the body for treating illnesses during the hottest period).

228
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,960
Dr. Zhao, that can wait.

229
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,360
Please...

230
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
check on my son.

231
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,880
He hasn't been able to sleep well recently.

232
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,720
I don't need to be checked. I'm fine.

233
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,080
Come on. You're already here.

234
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,680
Why not take the chance to let Dr. Zhao check? Come on.

235
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,640
Come on.

236
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,200
Come on. Let me take your pulse.

237
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,480
The other arm.

238
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,160
Dr. Zhao, how is he?

239
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,320
How is he?

240
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Don't talk.

241
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Stick out your tongue.

242
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,720
Are you having trouble falling asleep,

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,280
waking up from time to time, and having dreams?

244
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
How many hours do you sleep a night?

245
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,760
It's not regular.

246
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
Sometimes four or five hours.

247
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
Sometimes five or six hours.

248
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,680
This is due to the incoordination between spleen and stomach

249
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,320
and stagnation of liver qi.

250
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,760
Stagnation of liver qi?

251
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,880
My son is so young.

252
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,280
How can he have that?

253
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,560
He doesn't drink too much.

254
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,360
The spleen governs thoughts, and the liver emotions.

255
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,440
In the final analysis,

256
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,360
it's due to long-term mental tension

257
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
and also

258
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
not well released pressure.

259
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,040
You have too much work pressure, right?

260
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,400
Not too much.

261
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
I'll prescribe you something

262
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,600
to soothe your liver and invigorate your spleen,

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
and then other things

264
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,360
for feet soaking before going to bed.

265
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,200
How long does it take to recuperate?

266
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,800
The traditional Chinese medicine works slowly.

267
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,160
Young people are

268
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,360
under a lot of pressure now.

269
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
His situation is quite serious.

270
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,800
So,

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
you'd better take him to see the psychiatrist.

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
What are you talking about?

273
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,120
My son is not ill.

274
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,160
He just can't sleep well.

275
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,480
Why does he need a psychiatrist?

276
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,760
Bad sleep quality

277
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,440
has a lot to do

278
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
with mental stress.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
And you'd better have the brain checked

280
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,040
to see whether there are organic lesions.

281
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
What are you talking about?

282
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,320
That's enough.

283
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, take back your words.

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Pah!

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,200
My son is not sick at all.

286
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,280
What nonsense!

287
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,160
Look at you.

288
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,400
You called me to

289
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,760
check on your son,

290
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,120
but you won't listen to what I say.

291
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,720
I...

292
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,120
I... What I said was

293
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,240
to check on my son by the way.

294
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm your main patient.

295
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,920
Besides,

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,560
we're asking for your traditional Chinese medicine treatment.

297
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,240
Why are you

298
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
pushing us to Western medicine?

299
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,960
Are you trying to ruin your own business?

300
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,680
Alright.

301
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
Let's try some medicine

302
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,920
first.

303
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,800
Ling Xiao, 27 years old.

304
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,200
Get the medicine first.

305
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
I'll place a sanfutie for your dad.

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
Wait for me.

307
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,160
Well,

308
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,960
this medicine has the best effect in the morning.

309
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
But I don't think you have time in the day.

310
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,880
Dr. Zhao, from what do you see that

311
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,840
my son has that

312
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,920
or-organic lesions?

313
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
I didn't say he has lesions.

314
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,280
I said he should have it checked.

315
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
To have it checked?

316
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,200
Why does he need a psychiatrist

317
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,120
to check?

318
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,920
Man!

319
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,320
Only psychiatric patients go to a shrink.

320
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,200
How bad it'll be for him if people find out!

321
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,920
What? It stigmatizes you to go to a psychiatrist?

322
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,040
It's no problem how much stigma I get.

323
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
My son is only 27.

324
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,240
He still needs to get married.

325
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,520
In the future, when with his girlfriend,

326
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,720
if she hears that

327
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,880
he has seen a psychiatrist,

328
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,760
she'll think that

329
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
my son has a mental illness.

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
What kind of suggestion is this?

331
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
You have a pretty long-term plan.

332
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,360
Of course, I should,

333
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
and I must be careful too.

334
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,960
I work in the police station.

335
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,600
I've witnessed a lot, you know?

336
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,440
If I was

337
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,720
not careful,

338
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,520
could I ever

339
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,560
get your mother-in-law back to you?

340
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,760
OK, OK, OK! I'm not as careful as you are.

341
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,440
Exactly!

342
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,560
My son is not ill.

343
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
All right. He's healthy.

344
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,560
Let's try some medicine first.

345
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,200
Dr. Zhao, give me an exact time.

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
How long does it take to recuperate?

347
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
I can't.

348
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm a doctor,

349
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,400
not a fortune teller.

350
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,440
Your son looks depressed to me.

351
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,960
He has something on his mind.

352
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,760
It's psychological.

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,480
It's psychological.

354
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,720
You said

355
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,600
you were not a fortune teller.

356
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,400
Well...

357
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,200
Did you find it was psychological

358
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,320
from his pulse?

359
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,880
Well, Dr. Zhao,

360
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,640
You have to

361
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,600
help him recuperate.

362
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I owe you.

363
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
OK?

364
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,880
OK. Forget the medicated patches.

365
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,360
I must see how my son is doing now.

366
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,800
What a coincidence, Ziqiu!

367
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,080
I-I'm taking out the garbage.

368
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
Put it down by the door.

369
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,480
I'll throw it away along with mine tomorrow morning.

370
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
Go to bed early. Good night.

371
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,560
Wait.

372
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,120
What's the smell?

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,080
Really?

374
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
Did you fall in a dumpster?

375
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,280
It stinks.

376
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Maybe.

377
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm going to have a shower.

378
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,760
Wait.

379
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
I received a sum of money today.

380
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,720
I'll lend it to you.

381
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,120
What do I need your money?

382
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,960
Pay the credit card debt.

383
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,560
Keep it

384
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,640
with you.

385
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,920
Go home and mind your own business.

386
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,280
You know what?

387
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
You'd rather owe me money,

388
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,200
not the bank.

389
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,120
Ziqiu! Ziqiu!

390
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,440
Ziqiu, what are you doing?

391
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,440
Why are you so stubborn?

392
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,400
Don't pity me, will you?

393
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,640
Please!

394
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,680
I detest

395
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,160
and don't need to be pitied.

396
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,680
After I'm off duty tomorrow,

397
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,960
I'll get the medicine

398
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,040
and bring it to you.

399
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,440
No need, Dad.

400
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
You take it back first.

401
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
I'll go home to eat tomorrow.

402
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,920
OK.

403
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,760
Tell Mr. Li what you want to eat.

404
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,760
Dad.

405
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,200
Thank you.

406
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,920
For what?

407
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,600
Come on.

408
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
Thank you for taking me to the doctor.

409
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Bad sleep is not a disease.

410
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,280
I just think you just need to

411
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,760
take some traditional Chinese medicine to recuperate.

412
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't tell people you're sick.

413
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,920
OK.

414
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,240
Dad, see you.

415
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,720
OK.

416
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,960
In the future,

417
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,240
whatever is troubling you,

418
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
if you don't want to tell me,

419
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,240
talk to Mr. Li,

420
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,800
or Jianjian,

421
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,960
or Ziqiu.

422
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,960
Anyway,

423
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,520
don't hold back things in your heart.

424
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
You need to talk.

425
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,560
Dr. Zhao said that?

426
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,120
He said that

427
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,440
you shouldn't stay up late because it's bad for your health.

428
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,560
OK, I got it.

429
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,920
Really?

430
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes.

431
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,760
Go back then.

432
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Dad, pay attention to the road.

433
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,960
Whose feature has he got?

434
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
He doesn’t bother to look back.

435
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm so lucky. I'm about to win again.

436
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
South Wind (a mahjong tile).

437
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,320
Mr. Li, I need to go to toilet.

438
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Play it for me.

439
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,200
Well...

440
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,440
Come on. Hurry.

441
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,480
OK.

442
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I'm about to win.

443
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,160
Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

444
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,280
I haven't played for a long time. Well...

445
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,200
It’s your turn to get a tile.

446
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,160
My turn?

447
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,280
Haichao,

448
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,240
be honest with me.

449
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,040
Whenever He Mei comes to meet you,

450
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
she just wants to see Ziqiu?

451
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,440
Is there anything going on between you two?

452
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,120
What can be going on between me and her?

453
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,920
She's married with someone else.

454
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
And that son is several years old.

455
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,280
Really?

456
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,560
He Mei is unbelievable.

457
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,640
Why is she like

458
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
the demons

459
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
in the "Journey to the West"?

460
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
She's always so young,

461
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,880
like she never ages.

462
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,680
Now women can have plastic surgeries.

463
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,320
Simply have hyaluronic acid injected into the face.

464
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,160
I think that women should

465
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,520
age gracefully,

466
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,640
so that the wrinkles on the face

467
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,200
can become a gift of time.

468
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,960
As you see, a teacher is

469
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
so good at speech

470
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,480
and has a right mentality.

471
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,120
When He Mei was young,

472
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,640
she was very good at putting on makeup

473
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,920
and making herself beautifully dressed.

474
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,120
Green Dragon (a mahjong tile)!

475
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
I was so wrong

476
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,080
about He Mei.

477
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,880
I just paid attention to her prettiness.

478
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,960
A woman's prettiness is secondary.

479
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
The most important thing is inner beauty.

480
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,120
That's the true beauty that

481
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,360
glows from inside.

482
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,440
Haichao, don't you think so?

483
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,560
Yes. You're well-learned.

484
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
You must be right.

485
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm not.

486
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,080
I hear Mrs. Qian say

487
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,240
your child Jianjian is such a good girl.

488
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,840
How often does she come home?

489
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
She comes back once or twice a week.

490
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,840
Next time,

491
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
bring your sons.

492
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,760
Let them meet

493
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,840
and get to know each other.

494
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,800
Absolutely.

495
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,040
No, no, no.

496
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,960
It's not appropriate.

497
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,640
Her kids are

498
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
not going to be happy.

499
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,360
They won't be unhappy.

500
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,920
We treat each other equally

501
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,480
and my two sons respect me a lot.

502
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,160
Oh,

503
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,240
my sons

504
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,480
always want a younger sister.

505
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
I'm sure they'll like Jianjian a lot.

506
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,120
Well, Mrs. Zhang...

507
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,200
Call me Hongying.

508
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
Look how easy-going Hongying is.

509
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,160
Haichao, don't be shy.

510
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,680
Come on.

511
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I still have to prepare dishes. You guys go on.

512
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,480
Have fun.

513
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,480
Look at him.

514
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,080
He went shy.

515
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,360
He's too shy to take action.

516
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,040
If he has a thick skin,

517
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
he can marry anyone he wants.

518
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,880
It's OK, Mrs. Qian.

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,720
I'll take action instead.

520
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,600
Mrs. Zhang, you can get him.

521
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,800
He's such a good man.

522
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,040
Grasp this chance.

523
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,320
I must!

524
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
Alright. Whose turn is it now?

525
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,640
Come on.

526
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,320
It's my turn.

527
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,960
It took up all my mind.

528
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,720
Mrs. Zhang left?

529
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,160
Yes.

530
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,080
Mrs. Qian,

531
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,640
please tell

532
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,960
Mrs. Zhang later that

533
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,560
we're not suitable.

534
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,960
I have been single for so many years.

535
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm used to it already.

536
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,560
Then what position will you leave me in?

537
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,720
Mrs. Zhang

538
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
acts of her own free will.

539
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,000
Can I order her

540
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
not to come to your restaurant to eat?

541
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,880
You tell her to leave if you can.

542
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,800
I can't tell her to leave.

543
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,520
But how can this matter

544
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,120
involve the children meeting each other?

545
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,320
This is not our idea.

546
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,920
That's your Li Jianjian’s idea.

547
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,520
She suggested the two families sit together

548
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,200
to chat

549
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,760
and learn about each other.

550
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,760
Why did you

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,520
tell Jianjian

552
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,040
about it?

553
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,560
Why did...

554
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,280
It's your Li Jianjian

555
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,400
who urged us to

556
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,240
introduce a girlfriend to you.

557
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,080
Yup.

558
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
My dad is such a good person.

559
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,040
Don't look for anyone too fierce

560
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,920
or too mean.

561
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,440
I don't want him to get hurt.

562
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,880
My dad is 50 now.

563
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
He just began to have free time and energy to be with a girlfriend.

564
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,200
Right.

565
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,480
Her family environment

566
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
should not be too complicated.

567
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,040
Otherwise, if she creates messes all the time,

568
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,240
my dad will age rapidly.

569
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

570
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,120
Her children also have to support this,

571
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,760
and they have to be ambitious rather than depending on her support.

572
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Otherwise, it'll be bad if my dad has to

573
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,760
support them too.

574
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
Yes. This concern is reasonable.

575
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,840
Yes. Yes.

576
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,440
Also,

577
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,640
it'd be great

578
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,680
if she's well educated.

579
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,240
She may have

580
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
some healthy hobbies.

581
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,760
Square dancing is popular nowadays.

582
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,080
That's great.

583
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,600
It's very healthy.

584
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,800
It'd be wonderful

585
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,080
if she loves reading, planting some flowers,

586
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,200
and doing stuff.

587
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,720
This can cultivate our minds.

588
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,080
She is certainly a good woman.

589
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,160
We have a teacher Mrs. Zhang,

590
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,040
who meets your requirements very well.

591
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,200
She is educated and reasonable.

592
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,320
She has two children,

593
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,440
but both have grown up.

594
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,200
I took her to the noodle restaurant a few days ago,

595
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,400
and she talked to your dad.

596
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,040
Your dad acted like he didn't want it much.

597
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,120
How's her appearance?

598
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,680
She's very attractive.

599
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,760
And I think

600
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,800
she is kind of interested in your dad.

601
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,160
Then help them get together.

602
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,560
You know what?

603
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,840
My dad is too shy

604
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,920
and reserved.

605
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,400
They'll be acquainted after meeting a few times.

606
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,800
Let me check her too.

607
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,600
Make an appointment

608
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
with her sons too.

609
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,240
If she can educate her children well,

610
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,320
she is certainly a good woman.

611
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,840
Jianjian,

612
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,800
how unexpected!

613
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,360
You are so young,

614
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,680
but you know how to judge people already.

615
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,760
Who taught you that?

616
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,440
You did.

617
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,120
This is

618
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
what you've been teaching me ever since my childhood.

619
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,080
Oh, Jianjian,

620
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
you're such a sweet girl.

621
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
OK. I'll try my best.

622
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,440
OK great!

623
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,480
Thank you, Mrs. Qian.

624
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,640
You're welcome. You're welcome.

625
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,960
See you then. Bye.

626
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,400
OK, bye.

627
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,520
Li Jianjian talked

628
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,080
like a little cannon.

629
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,440
Exactly!

630
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,320
It was like bam bam bam.

631
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,160
She almost

632
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
blew our minds away.

633
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,440
If she runs a match-making agency,

634
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,040
she can make a lot of money.

635
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,120
Frankly speaking, Jianjian is worried about you.

636
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,200
Just try to be with Mrs. Zhang.

637
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
If you two aren't meant to be, forget it then.

638
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,400
Yes.

639
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,360
Is the video ready?

640
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,680
Yes. Come on.

641
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,480
I thought I was dreaming.

642
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,160
It felt like a ghost of the wronged.

643
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,120
You go ahead.

644
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,160
You go ahead.

645
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,920
On your side,

646
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
I always doubt...

647
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,480
Although you have a day off today,

648
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,000
it's too hot outside.

649
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Let's go out for dinner in the evening.

650
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,720
OK?

651
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,520
If you want to go to the studio,

652
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,320
I can go with you.

653
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,960
I don't want to go.

654
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,200
It's too hot.

655
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,680
I don't want to work.

656
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,840
I just want to

657
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,360
enjoy the air conditioner and watermelon at home,

658
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,640
and lie down to watch a film.

659
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Since you were a child,

660
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,880
You’ve been liking to eat watermelon and potato chips

661
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,280
in my bed.

662
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,480
How comfortable it is to lie down and eat!

663
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,520
In the past few years,

664
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,680
my mom ate in bed every day.

665
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,800
If she heard this,

666
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm sure she would be angry and hit you in the head

667
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,440
with her crutch.

668
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,440
by the way

669
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,640
how is Aunt Chen Ting now?

670
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,360
She can walk,

671
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,320
but not so normally.

672
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,840
The muscles are a little atrophied.

673
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,640
It hurts when it rains, or it is a cloudy day.

674
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,960
But she can take care of herself.

675
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,640
She can't stand for a long time.

676
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,360
So now

677
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,880
she can't work.

678
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
What was she like at first?

679
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,200
I mean

680
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,760
when you just went to take care of her in Singapore.

681
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,920
Why did you want to ask this all of a sudden?

682
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,160
At that time, Dad didn't let me ask much,

683
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,400
and you didn't say much about it,

684
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,760
so I don't know.

685
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,720
It's a thing of the past.

686
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,000
You must give me a chance to

687
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,160
pity you.

688
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
You must keep the most pitiful state,

689
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
because my favorite thing to do

690
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,120
is to pity someone.

691
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,480
Why do you like to keep this in mind?

692
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,240
You didn't know that?

693
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
Tell me.

694
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,680
Start from the very beginning.

695
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,720
At the beginning...

696
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,320
At the beginning...

697
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,320
my mom was

698
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,160
like a plant in a flowerpot.

699
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,520
I couldn't figure out

700
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,040
how to help the plant

701
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
get out of the pot.

702
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,880
We can only

703
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,000
do passive massage now

704
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,520
to prevent muscular atrophy.

705
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Do it four times a day

706
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,760
for 40 minutes each time.

707
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,600
At what time?

708
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,160
You can decide that yourself.

709
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,680
But doctor, my lower limbs

710
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,920
can't feel at all.

711
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,600
When can I get off bed

712
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,400
and walk?

713
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,720
Our rehabilitation training

714
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,480
for you

715
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,560
has just begun.

716
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,320
As long as you keep doing rehabilitation

717
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,680
to establish neural connections,

718
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,800
it will keep getting better.

719
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,280
But when on earth

720
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,400
can I walk?

721
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,480
It depends on

722
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,520
your recovery.

723
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,280
It's not clear whether your walking ability

724
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,760
can be restored.

725
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,440
I believe you’ll be able to walk.

726
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,160
OK. Have a try.

727
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,120
She didn't believe it herself.

728
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,080
Neither did we.

729
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,760
But we had no other way

730
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,160
but to believe.

731
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,240
Is this right?

732
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,560
Yes. The key is to be gentle.

733
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,240
Most of her meals

734
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,480
were liquid

735
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,760
and easy to digest.

736
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,960
Ling Xiao, I'd like to tell you something.

737
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,840
A very interesting thing

738
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,480
happened

739
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,680
in our school today.

740
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,480
I have a classmate, who is a boy.

741
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,160
And he's chubby.

742
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,480
Because he is so fat that...

743
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
Chengzi wouldn't leave with her grandma.

744
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,160
Look at that.

745
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,120
So I must take care of her too.

746
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,400
But thanks to her presence,

747
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,720
the ward was not always silent.

748
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,760
Ling Xiao.

749
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,240
They all know

750
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,120
I have a brother now!

751
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,280
They all envy me for

752
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,960
having you escort me to school.

753
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,760
You should eat.

754
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
It's getting cold.

755
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,280
Have more spareribs.

756
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,560
What's the smell?

757
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,240
It stinks.

758
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,200
The most embarrassing and undignified momen

759
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,240
for paralyzed patients,

760
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
incontinence.

761
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,960
Chengzi, send for a care worker.

762
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,440
Quickly!

763
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,280
Don't touch it. Go out.

764
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,640
Mom.

765
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,800
Go out.

766
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,080
Don't you understand? Go out!

767
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,640
I don't need your help.

768
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,600
Mom! Mom!

769
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,360
Go out.

770
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,000
Mom.

771
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,160
It was from that moment that

772
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,280
I could

773
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,200
really understand her a little

774
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,800
how painful she was.

775
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,200
If only she died

776
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,360
in that car accident!

777
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
What's the meaning

778
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,720
of living like that?

779
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,120
Hi.

780
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,560
Where's my mom?

781
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,000
In the bathroom.

782
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
She wanted to freshen up.

783
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,360
It's been a long time.

784
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,720
She should have finished now.

785
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,200
You make the bed. I'll check on her.

786
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,800
Mrs. Chen cut her wrist!

787
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,760
I'll get the doctor.

788
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,320
Mom!

789
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
I had been wondering

790
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,320
what the point was

791
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,840
to live hard,

792
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,880
so hard.

793
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,600
There is a beast

794
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,240
in everyone's heart.

795
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,280
If you're not careful,

796
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,000
the beast will

797
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,880
come out of the heart

798
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,920
and hurt people at will.

799
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,080
I want to go home!

800
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,600
I don't want to stay in the hospital.

801
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,400
Can't you hear me?

802
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,000
I want to go home!

803
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,040
I don't want to be kept here

804
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,440
like an animal.

805
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,680
I beg you.

806
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't just clean it!

807
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,520
I beg you to let me go.

808
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,240
Let me go!

809
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,160
And those who stand on the edge of darkness

810
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,960
can easily be

811
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,960
dragged into the long night.

812
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,360
It seems that

813
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
the night will never end.

814
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,000
One can only clench teeth

815
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,120
and get through it.

816
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,400
Leave me alone!

817
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,040
Let me die.

818
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,080
Let me die!

819
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,200
Not just me,

820
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,760
we were all trying to find the way

821
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,480
in the boundless darkness

822
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
extremely carefully.

823
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,520
Would you like some rice, Mom?

824
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,160
Mom, have some porridge.

825
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,640
No.

826
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,640
Have a little.

827
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,360
Let me fill the bowl with porridge for you.

828
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,600
I said no!

829
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Sorry.

830
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,560
I really didn't mean to.

831
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,520
I'll go for a shower.

832
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,190
Sorry. Sorry.

833
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,360
Sorry.

834
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,000
Ling Xiao, time to take the pills.

835
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
Let me do it. I've learned it by heart.

836
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,150
You don't have the strength.

837
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,480
I just want to try to use crutches.

838
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,680
I'd like

839
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,600
to go to the rehabilitation center tomorrow

840
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,280
to ask about the rehabilitation course of treatment.

841
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,520
Didn't the doctor tell us?

842
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,880
I can stand up one day.

843
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,040
At that time,

844
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,280
I thought

845
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,400
it was finally about to be dawn.

846
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,520
No problem.

847
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,800
I'll take care of you in the future

848
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,800
What a heavy rain!

849
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,480
Yes.

850
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,560
This heavy rain

851
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,400
came right when we have a dinner party.

852
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,160
Exactly.

853
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,440
Mei,

854
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,800
are you really not going to

855
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,640
send Dongdong to a special school?

856
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,000
He's almost

857
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,360
old enough to go to primary school.

858
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,080
What will you do if this never changes?

859
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,960
I have. It didn't work out well.

860
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,920
Is it very hard

861
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,440
for you to take care of

862
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,960
such a child alone?

863
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,120
Fortunately, Dongdong is a good boy.

864
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,760
Dongdong,

865
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,720
you don't like these?

866
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,040
If you don't like these,

867
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,120
let me take you to get other food, OK?

868
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,560
Let's go.

869
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,280
Dim sum is your favorite!

870
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,320
Let me get it for you, OK?

871
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,320
Let's have two dumplings...

872
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,560
And a portion of glutinous rice filled with chicken.

873
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
What else shall we take?

874
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,600
Dongdong?

875
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,720
Dongdong?

876
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,440
Dongdong?

877
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,840
Dongdong?

878
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,440
Dongdong,

879
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,920
why did you come here?

880
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,520
You scared me.

881
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,160
Haven't I told you?

882
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,920
Don't get out my sight.

883
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,760
Thank you.

884
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,760
Ziqiu?

885
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
Why are you here?

886
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,760
I work here.

887
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,920
You closed up your shop?

888
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,320
I’m going to work.

889
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,120
Hi,

890
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,400
is my cake ready?

891
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,560
Here it is.

892
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,160
Thank you.

893
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,680
Enjoy.

894
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,560
Sorry.

895
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
I have nothing to give you.

896
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,040
What?

897
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:05,800
I really

898
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
don't have anything.

899
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,960
I'm not lying.

900
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,920
I really don't

901
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,640
have anything.

902
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
Just like you, no one wants me.

903
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,440
Alright...

904
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,480
Go! Go!

905
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,520
I have nothing.

906
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,200
Ziqiu.

907
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,720
Ziqiu, wait.

908
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,800
Ziqiu.

909
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,160
Ziqiu.

910
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,840
Why did you run so fast?

911
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,480
Where did you get this dog?

912
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,800
Outside.

913
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,520
Outside, where?

914
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,680
Near the dumpsters.

915
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,040
Just like that?

916
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,280
No one wants it, just like me.

917
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,440
Such a poor thing.

918
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,680
Let me see.

919
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,400
It does look similar to you.

920
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,800
Its eyes and nose

921
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,480
are as adorable as yours.

922
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,880
Whom did you learn it from?

923
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,000
You talked like a two-timer.

924
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,000
Two-timer?

925
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,280
I was trying to make you happy.

926
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,000
You were trying to make me happy,

927
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,320
but I don’t feel happy.

928
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,200
You don't?

929
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,240
I don't.

930
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,040
What have you been doing these days?

931
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,200
You always come home so late.

932
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,400
Nothing.

933
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,240
You have the smell of garbage.

934
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,680
You have.

935
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,640
Why don't you talk?

936
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,920
I don't want to.

937
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,360
Because you'll feel even worse.

938
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,400
Just talk.

939
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,680
I'm not used to you being quiet.

940
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,920
How much longer

941
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,480
are you going to act weird in front of me?
