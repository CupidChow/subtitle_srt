Episode 2

4
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,009
Today you can eat vegetables only.

5
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,750
Eat.

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,850
Li Jianjian,

7
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,160
tell me the truth,

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,880
did you bite anyone else?

9
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,020
Stop giggling.

10
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Ling Xiao?

11
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,850
What's this?

12
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,110
[Povidone-iodine]

13
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,880
Why didn't you wake me up

14
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,760
to cook for you?

15
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,770
I'll make a dish for you.

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Never mind, Mom.

17
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,250
I like instant noodles.

18
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Hello.

19
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
There you are.

20
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,370
We are here to see you

21
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
and we bring you some fruit.

22
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,520
It's really kind of you

23
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,640
to do that.

24
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Come in.

25
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,080
Well...

26
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,120
I haven't tidied the rooms up,

27
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
so you needn't change your shoes.

28
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,600
OK.

29
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Come in.

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Chen Ting.

31
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Yes?

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,480
You are not feeling well?

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm fine.

34
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,600
I took a nap just now.

35
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,160
You see, I didn't expect your visit

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,890
and get anything ready for you.

37
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,269
I just bring Mrs. Qian

38
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,360
to pay a visit to you,

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,620
and we will leave soon.

40
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,480
Take a seat, please.

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,810
What took Ling Xiao so long to have dinner?

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,440
Well, he's hungry now

43
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
because he wasn't full at noon.

44
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Besides, he likes instant noodles.

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
Say hello.

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
Hello, Mrs. Fang, Mrs. Qian.

47
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
Hello.

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Would you like some tea?

49
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
Yes, whatever.

50
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,560
What a nice boy!

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,740
Don't let him make tea,

52
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,080
or he might get scalded.

53
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
No matter, he can do everything.

54
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,320
Chen Ting,

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,360
you've been living here

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,020
for a month or so, haven't you?

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,240
Why do you shut yourself at home

58
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,680
and never go out?

59
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,760
I don't like going out

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,600
because I think it's hot outside.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
You are too introverted,

62
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,920
and so is Ling Xiao.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,180
I always see him

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
playing on his own.

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
We guys often get together

66
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,240
at Haichao Noodles,

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
playing mahjong

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,800
and chatting with each other.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,080
It's very lively.

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,840
Exactly.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,640
I don't know how to play mahjong.

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,760
No matter.

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
You'll know if you learn.

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
Actually, playing mahjong

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,450
is also a way of communication.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
You see, you always shut yourself up

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,440
in the house every day,

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
and you can only see Heping

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,840
around you.

80
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,570
How come there's no argument between both of you?

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
Well, thank you.

82
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
It's really nice of you, Ling Xiao.

83
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,840
Nice of you, Ling Xiao.

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Go have your noodles, Ling Xiao.

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm full, Mom.

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
I want to go play outside.

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
Well, OK.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
Ling Xiao is a nice boy.

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
He's sensible.

90
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,280
Something brings you here today, right?

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
You've heard of the argument

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,600
between Heping and me?

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
No, no.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Arguments happen to every family.

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Yesterday,

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,080
we ran into Heping

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,840
and talked with him

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,080
when we came to Haichao Noodles for dinner,

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,680
Oh.

100
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,520
So what did he say about me?

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
He said how kind you are, of course.

102
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,040
Exactly.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's true. Trust us.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,160
In fact,

105
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
I understand you a lot.

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,280
I was the same as you were

107
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
when I was young.

108
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,760
I used to be a teacher.

109
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,700
I gave birth to two children within three years.

110
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,540
As a mother, I could do nothing

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,000
but resigned.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
I took care of

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,360
my children

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,960
and my family wholeheartedly.

115
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,880
My husband

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,120
was a doctor.

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
He couldn't help me with anything.

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,560
As long as he was busy,

119
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,520
he would work day and night.

120
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
I felt so exhausted

121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,440
that I was very angry as soon as I saw him.

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,200
I thought he didn't understand me,

123
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
and we had arguments very often.

124
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,400
Precisely.

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,840
It is the same to Heping.

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
When I need him to help me,

127
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
he's always helping others.

128
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,480
Actually, this is his job.

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,420
However busy he is,

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,200
he has to take care of his family.

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Right.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,240
In fact, I don't know

133
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,280
how to talk properly,

134
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,920
but this is what I mean.

135
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,160
Anyway,

136
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,760
of course,

137
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,120
a man works hard outside

138
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,580
for the sake of his family.

139
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Heping makes money and support your family,

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
while you take care of them.

141
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
Each of you does your own job.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,480
Heping is a man of responsibility.

143
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,520
As long as you take good care of your son,

144
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,480
he will keep his mind on his work.

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,400
It tastes really good.

146
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
It is really yummy.

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,080
The food my dad makes is very nice,

148
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,480
such as braised pork, deep-fried spare ribs, shrimps with spiced salt

149
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,880
and my favorite sweet and sour spare ribs.

150
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,460
It tastes really good.

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
It is really yummy.

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,800
Hey, you are drinking.

153
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,760
What good event are you celebrating for?

154
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,890
I'll drink with you.

155
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
You drink beer only

156
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
without any dish?

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,760
Well,

158
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,200
I'll make a dish for you.

159
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,320
Ling Xiao,

160
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,169
go play outside for a while.

161
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,030
It's late at night.

162
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,490
Where do you want him to go?

163
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,520
Get out.

164
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,120
What's going on?

165
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,080
I've been busy for a whole day,

166
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
so don't pick on me as soon as I'm back, OK?

167
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm picking on you?

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,360
You asked Mrs. Fang and Mrs. Qian

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
to visit me and talk with me like that.

170
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,720
Why did you pick on me?

171
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
What brought them here?

172
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Ling Xiao!

173
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
What did they say?

174
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Keep pretending.

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,280
Do it.

176
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,160
How come they know

177
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,640
about our family affairs

178
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,160
if you didn't tell them?

179
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,520
I've never told anyone

180
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,760
about our family affairs.

181
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
I swear,

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
I didn't ask them to visit at all.

183
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,520
Enough.

184
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,880
Let's stop talking about this.

185
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,920
I'll get changed.

186
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,520
I have to go to the police station later

187
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,840
for overtime work.

188
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,280
Don't go anywhere today,

189
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm telling you.

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
Well, Chen Ting,

191
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,520
my colleague's child is sick,

192
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,160
and I promised him to take over his work.

193
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,600
You take over your colleague's work because his child is sick.

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Then where were you

195
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,290
when our child was sick?

196
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,520
Where were you?

197
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,440
Would you stop

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,760
talking about our daughter?

199
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,720
Stop talking about her.

200
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
No way!

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Chen Ting,

202
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,840
I beg you,

203
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,280
please let me off, OK?

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,520
OK?

205
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
I beg you.

206
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm exhausted.

207
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
All right.

208
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
Thanks.

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
I'll let you off.

210
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,420
What are you doing, Chen Ting?

211
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
Let me go!

212
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Stop that.

213
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,440
I want to meet my daughter.

214
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,960
I want to meet my daughter.

215
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,960
Ling Xiao?

216
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,280
Did you have dinner?

217
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
Today we will have deep-fried spare ribs.

218
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
My dad's deep-fried spare ribs

219
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,820
taste really nice.

220
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,160
Let's go.

221
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,600
Come on, let's go.

222
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,520
Let's go.

223
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,800
Eat slowly,

224
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,420
or you might choke.

225
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Delicious, right?

226
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,880
Yes.

227
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,760
[One Hundred Thousand Whys]

228
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,280
Ling Xiao,

229
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,580
I've stuck the pieces of the photo together for you.

230
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
Your younger sister went to the sea

231
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
and became a fairy, just like my mom.

232
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,720
In a very long time,

233
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
we will be there too

234
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,760
and meet them by then.

235
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Who told you this?

236
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,360
My dad did.

237
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,280
He knows everything.

238
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,440
He lied to you.

239
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,400
They are dead.

240
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
It means they are gone.

241
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,400
Then where are they if they are gone?

242
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,040
They are just gone.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,460
We can no longer meet them.

244
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
Why?

245
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
Because all men must die.

246
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,560
After she died,

247
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,120
I burnt her belongings,

248
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
tore the photos of her

249
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
and forgot her death.

250
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,780
This is also what your dad did.

251
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,760
Come on.

252
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,280
I'll show you

253
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
my dad's secret.

254
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,400
Look, this is my mom.

255
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,200
All of these are photos of my mom.

256
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,480
Come here.

257
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,940
Here are my mom's clothes,

258
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,280
and under the bed are my mom's shoes.

259
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,260
My dad didn't throw them away,

260
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,240
so he won't

261
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
forget my mom.

262
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
My mom smells nice.

263
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,960
This is her smell.

264
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,490
Smells good?

265
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Actually I know everything.

266
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
He always misses my mom

267
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,600
secretly on his own,

268
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,760
Why?

269
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,180
Don't you miss her?

270
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Yes, I do.

271
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,770
But I have to pretend not to miss her

272
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,800
because my dad may be sad.

273
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
What will you do

274
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,580
when you miss your mom?

275
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,880
I will just draw pictures.

276
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
I'll draw pictures of my mom.

277
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,840
I also miss my mother

278
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,120
secretly on my own,

279
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,260
keeping my dad from knowing that.

280
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
So you can also miss your sister

281
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,400
secretly on your own,

282
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,180
keeping your parents from knowing that.

283
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,370
I can't let my dad find that.

284
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,890
Let's go watch "Black Cat Detective".

285
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,690
Come on, we are having fried-pork in scoop today!

286
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,500
We are having sliced fish in hot chili oil today!

287
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,320
Today we are having

288
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,920
my favorite sweet and sour spare ribs!

289
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,600
Let's go!

290
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,240
Time to have noodles.

291
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go!

292
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
Chen Ting,

293
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
could you let me

294
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,920
have my dinner steadily?

295
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
Stop yelling!

296
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Hold it.

297
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
A worm creeps out

298
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,320
from your nostril.

299
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,650
Eat slowly, or you might choke.

300
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Hello.

301
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,840
Is that Li Haichao speaking?

302
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,440
This is He Mei.

303
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,720
He Mei?

304
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,520
I...

305
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,920
Take it easy. Go ahead.

306
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,160
I'd like to borrow some money from you.

307
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,600
What?

308
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,240
My mother is seriously sick, so I have to go back to see her immediately.

309
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,960
Seriously?

310
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,760
Besides,

311
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,720
I want you

312
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,080
to take care of Ziqiu for a period.

313
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,800
All right.

314
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,960
Don't worry,

315
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,770
I'm going to pick him up.

316
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,560
Jianjian, Ling Xiao.

317
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,720
I have to go out

318
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,160
to do something urgent.

319
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Take it easy.

320
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,040
After having dinner,

321
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,800
you can go to Mrs. Qian's

322
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,280
to play

323
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,760
and wait for me,

324
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,349
got it?

325
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,349
Remember, lock the door

326
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,349
before you go out.

327
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,089
Take care of Jianjian.

328
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,579
Well, I'm leaving.

329
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,720
Come on, Ziqiu.

330
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,980
Come in and take a look.

331
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,880
Come on.

332
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,570
This is your room in the future.

333
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
You will live here.

334
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,520
By then,

335
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,580
I'll prepare a bed over there for you.

336
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,120
How's that?

337
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Let me show you more.

338
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,290
This is the kitchen,

339
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,280
where I'm going to make

340
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,610
delicious food here for you in the future.

341
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,240
That's the toilet,

342
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
and this is the living-room.

343
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,000
See? So many toys here.

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can play with whatever you want.

345
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,440
This room

346
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,840
belongs to Li Jianjian.

347
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,360
Jianjian

348
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,880
is hot-tempered

349
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,720
and always gets annoyed without reason,

350
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,280
but you are older than her,

351
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,600
so you should yield to her a bit

352
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
as her older brother, OK?

353
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,600
OK.

354
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Good boy.

355
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,040
When will you marry my mom?

356
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,700
Marry your mom?

357
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,890
What do you mean?

358
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,320
In the daytime, I saw you

359
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,800
give money to my mom.

360
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
It's a thick wad of 100-yuan notes,

361
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,040
and you let me live in your house.

362
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,000
Well...

363
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,320
Ziqiu,

364
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,360
is there anything problem giving money to your mom?

365
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,920
My auntie said

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,240
the money a man gives a woman

367
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,000
is a betrothal present.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
That means marriage.

369
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,400
You know betrothal presents?

370
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,680
Since your mom has accepted my betrothal present,

371
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,480
in the future, you will be a child

372
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,600
of my family,

373
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,480
and you have to listen to me,

374
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
got it?

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Ziqiu,

376
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,360
don't scare me.

377
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm kidding.

378
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,480
Dad.

379
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,280
What?

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,520
Dad.

381
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,320
Yes.

382
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,000
My son.

383
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,800
Dad.

384
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,280
Come on,

385
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,520
I'll tidy your room up, OK?

386
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,040
OK.

387
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,200
Come on,

388
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,400
My son.

389
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,680
You are not allowed to live in my house.

390
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,320
He's not your dad,

391
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,240
so you can't call him dad.

392
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,840
Jianjian,

393
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
stop bullying Ziqiu,

394
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,600
got it?

395
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,960
What's up?

396
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Why do you bite him again, Jianjian?

397
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,000
Let him go!

398
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,920
Let him go!

399
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,280
Don't act like a dog!

400
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,280
Let him go!

401
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,490
You are not allowed to have meat for lunch!

402
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,640
Li Haichao

403
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
took his girlfriend's son

404
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,010
back to his home.

405
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,920
He said

406
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,280
that his girlfriend

407
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
has to go back to the countryside

408
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
to take care of her mother who is sick.

409
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,760
He made trouble this time.

410
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,800
Jianjian doesn't agree.

411
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,730
Look. They are quarreling loudly.

412
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,760
Son,

413
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,410
aren't you hungry without eating?

414
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,020
He can't be hungry.

415
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,040
When it is time to have a meal,

416
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,100
he goes to the neighbor's home to eat.

417
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
Chen Ting,

418
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,800
when it is time to have a meal,

419
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
you must cook for him.

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,080
Otherwise, when he is hungry,

421
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,320
he goes to the neighbor's home to eat.

422
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,980
Doesn't he?

423
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,680
Anyway, you take this place as a hotel.

424
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,940
Why do you care so much?

425
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,320
Go!

426
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,080
♫Your eyes stare like copper bells,♫

427

Well.

436

Let go of me.

437
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Grandma!

438
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,360
Ziqiu.

439
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,040
Yah!

440
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,760
Get rid of the bad guy!

441
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,160
Get rid of the enemy!

442
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,220
Thank you, Dad.

443
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,020
You want to spit it out?

444
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,610
Dare you spit it out?

445
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
It took me time to cook it.

446
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,160
If you spit it out, you'll have to pick and eat it.

447
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,400
Eat it. Eat it.

448
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
You must recite every day, you know?

449
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
When did you pick it and take it back?

450
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,880
How come a good photo

451
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
became like this?

452
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,090
Give it to me!

453
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,640
Chen Ting,

454
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
this is the only one group photo left.

455
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,240
Let him keep it. OK?

456
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,620
Give it to me or not!

457
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,930
Go to school now.

458
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,960
Give it to me or not!

459
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,400
Give it to me or not!

460
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,000
Are you crazy? Why do you beat him?

461
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,600
I am crazy.

462
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,240
The one who was choked to death by the walnut should have been me.

463
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,800
Can you not mention that?

464
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,960
Besides, that's an accident.

465
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,160
Nobody blames you for that.

466
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,120
You don't need to blame me.

467
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,680
So I must thank you, right?

468
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
You don't look after the kids,

469
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
so you cannot take the responsibility.

470
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,960
You can

471
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
judge me in a lofty manner.

472
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
It's all my fault, right?

473
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
I didn't judge you in a lofty manner.

474
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,640
Can we not mention that?

475
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,370
Let's live a peaceful life, OK?

476
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,760
You cannot mention that.

477
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,240
You can be out every day.

478
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,200
I have to live such a damned life.

479
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,760
I have to live such a damned life.

480
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
And you!

481
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,680
Why,

482
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,600
why did you give the walnut

483
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,880
to your sister?

484
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
Can you not mention the walnut?

485
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,960
Can you?

486
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,020
Am I wrong about anything?

487
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
It's his fault.

488
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,720
He caused his sister's death.

489
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,440
Don't mention that. OK?

490
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,100
He caused his sister's death.

491
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,760
Shut up!

492
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,520

493
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,160

was asked by her friends to play mahjong.

522
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,160
She asked Ling Xiao to look after his sister at home.

523
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,040
This little girl loved eating walnuts.

524
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,280
Usually Ling Xiao

525
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,040
fed her.

526
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
There's no problem at all.

527
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,080
That day, it happened that

528
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
a piece of walnut meat

529
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,520
was stuck in the girl's trachea.

530
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,720
But the door was locked from outside,

531
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,360
so, Ling Xiao couldn't get out.

532
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,480
He cried for help,

533
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,740
but nobody responded.

534
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
When Chen Ting was back,

535
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,600
the girl had long stopped breathing.

536
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,920
She was choked to death.

537
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,480
Whom did you hear the story from?

538
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,160
Her home

539
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
was in the Beili Courtyard.

540
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,810
My aunt lives there.

541
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
A few days ago, I went to see my aunt.

542
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,400
She told me that.

543
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,920
Chen Ting

544
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,280
couldn't bear to live there.

545
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,440
She was criticized by people behind her back.

546
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,400
Then she moved.

547
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,760
That was an accident.

548
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,680
She was unwilling to let it happen.

549
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,010
That little girl was only three years old.

550
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,480
What a pity!

551
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,040
She let her son look after her daughter.

552
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,680
As a mother,

553
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,440
she was really comfortable.

554
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,720
You can't say that.

555
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,120
Life was not easy for her.

556
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,480
Your neighborhood committee

557
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
always tries to smooth things over.

558
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,400
In my view,

559
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,400
it's right and good that Heping

560
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,520
divorced her.

561
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,920
They should have divorced earlier.

562
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
If there is someone suitable,

563
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
I'll introduce a girlfriend to him.

564
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Look.

565
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,240
I introduced a girlfriend to Haichao

566
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,120
and her child was already taken home

567
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,360
and called him dad.

568
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,520
Look.

569
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,040
These are the shoes He Mei bought me for being a matchmaker for them.

570
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
They look nice, right?

571
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,880
Yes, yes.

572
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,400
Good, good.

573
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,680
Haichao,

574
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,640
when will you

575
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,840
go to register for marriage with He Mei?

576
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,320
Our relationship hasn't gone that far.

577
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,200
We'll see after getting along with each other for some time.

578
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,920
Haichao,

579
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,280
don't forget to invite us

580
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,600
when you hold the wedding.

581
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,560
Right.

582
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,080
He feels shy.

583
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,960
It's your turn now.

584
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
It's my turn.

585
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,080
Haichao,

586
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,850
I'm here to take my son home.

587
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,480
He is asleep.

588
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
He is asleep?

589
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,280
Why are you so late every day?

590
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
I was busy with a case in the police station,

591
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,370
so, I couldn't leave early.

592
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,360
You haven't eaten, have you?

593
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
No, I haven't.

594
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,410
I've prepared two dishes. Come on.

595
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,560
Then, then I'll accept your kindness.

596
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,520
Make yourself at home.

597
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,120
It's nothing. It's nothing.

598
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,370
I told two stories, and then they fell asleep.

599
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,060
He's a good boy.

600
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's go.

601
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,620
Let's have a drink.

602
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,960
Haichao,

603
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
during these months

604
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
since we moved here,

605
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,080
we've bothered you a lot.

606
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
Thank you.

607
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,240
Don't mention it.

608
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,200
It's nothing.

609
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,160
It's just about having one more person to feed.

610
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,400
You've heard about

611
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,380
what happened to my family, haven't you?

612
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
The neighbors mean no harm.

613
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,800
They just

614
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,840
chat and joke casually

615
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,240
after meal hours.

616
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm a policeman in this area.

617
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,880
Don't I know that?

618
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,140
They just talk casually about

619
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,400
what happened to my family

620
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,520
at their leisure.

621
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,280
I hear and forget.

622
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,320
I don't take it seriously at all.

623
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,960
I understand.

624
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,480
But I really don't understand

625
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
just what happened to

626
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,520
Chen Ting.

627
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,120
Why is she getting worse and worse?

628
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,600
She keeps making a loud noise every day.

629
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,600
I,

630
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,800
I really don't know

631
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,040
what to do.

632
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,640
I've said a lot to comfort her.

633
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,640
You've heard about what happened to my family, haven't you?

634
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes, I have.

635
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,610
It's just over one year.

636
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,280
It's really hard for you.

637
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,840
At the time,

638
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,130
when Huiying just passed away,

639
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
I was so sad.

640
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,440
The neighbors

641
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,100
took turns to persuade me.

642
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,080
You know what?

643
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,960
Those words of comfort

644
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,240
were just like knives

645
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,480
cutting in my heart

646
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,920
one after another.

647
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,920
I feel particularly regretful.

648
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,640
Why did I

649
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
listen to her?

650
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Why didn't I manage to persuade her?

651
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
Why did I believe that she could tough it out

652
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
only with confidence?

653
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,920
Why didn't I listen to

654
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
what the doctor said?

655
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,400
So, I know

656
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,320
feeling regretful is torturous.

657
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,160
I feel

658
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,680
Chen Ting

659
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,240
may not be able to

660
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,000
let it go,

661
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,320
so, she is like this.

662
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
When Chen Ting was pregnant with Yun

663
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,240
for three months,

664
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,160
we knew that.

665
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,600
To give birth to this child,

666
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Chen Ting lost her job.

667
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,360
And I

668
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,080
was punished and fined by my unit.

669
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,920
And I was removed of the prize which was about to be given to me.

670
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,780
Don't mention getting promoted.

671
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,880
I almost lost my job.

672
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,440
But I haven't regretted that

673
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,240
in my life.

674
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,889
What I always feel regretful about

675
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,889
is that I failed to take good care of my children.

676
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,880
I failed to take good care of Yun.

677
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,710
But we have to keep on living.

678
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,400
Am I right?

679
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,840
So,

680
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,929
we must grind our teeth

681
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,320
and hold on.

682
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,360
If we adults are beaten,

683
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,850
who will take care of our children?

684
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,880
You are right.

685
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,960
For the sake of our children,

686
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,000
we must hold on.

687
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,880
Right?

688
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,960
Haichao, I'm telling you.

689
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,240
Ling Xiao wasn't like this.

690
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,760
He had a bright and cheerful disposition.

691
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,420
He was talkative and playful.

692
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,840
But now,

693
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,280
he doesn't talk much.

694
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,000
He has suffered a lot.

695
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,160
He is not like Jianjian.

696
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,560
She has a good character.

697
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,200
She is...

698
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Jianjian...

699
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,000
Don't mention it.

700
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,080
It's strange.

701
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
She isn't like me,

702
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,680
nor her mother.

703
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,440
I don't know whom she is like

704
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,400
in temper.

705
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,440
She is

706
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,320
inexplicably optimistic.

707
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,560
That's good.

708
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,280
Cheers.

709
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,000
To optimism.

710
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,850
To the ones who passed away.

711
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,080
To

712
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
the one who left.

713
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,360
I wonder why Ling Xiao

714
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,400
always comes to your home

715
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,120
to eat.

716
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,360
It turns out that even the cucumber salad you make

717
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,080
is different than the dish in other places.

718
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,940
It tastes good.

719
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,240
If you like, come here often.

720
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,500
Make yourself at home.

721
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,560
Then I'll bother you.

722
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,440
Not at all.

723
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,520
It's nothing.

724
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,240
I'm telling you.

725
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,920
It's good this way.

726
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,640
Our kids can accompany each other.

727
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,240
Am I right?

728
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,640
Then, from now on,

729
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,840
I will feel free at your home.

730
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,680
Make yourself at home.

731
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,080
Cheers.

732
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,330
I'm telling you.

733
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,080
You can order dishes.

734
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,730
If you want to have noodles,

735
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,180
I'll cook noodles.

736
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,410
I want to have spare ribs tomorrow.

737
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm telling you, Haichao...

738
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,600
[Autumn 2009]

739
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,960
Jianjian, it's time to have breakfast.

740
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,680
Today is the first day of school,

741
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
so don't be late.

742
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,440
Hurry up.

743
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,840
Don't dawdle.

744
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Or you'll be late.

745
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,280
Dad,

746
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,200
I bought deep-fried dough sticks and mochi

747
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,680
back home.

748
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,000
OK.

749
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,200
Ask Ling Xiao to have breakfast.

750
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,640
Oh, OK.

751
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,840
Li Jianjian, are you inside?

752
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm emptying the bowels.

753
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,880
Hurry. I can't hold any longer.

754
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,960
Don't urge me. I'm enjoying myself.

755
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,480
He Ziqiu,

756
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,050
I've told you many times

757
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,440
that don't come to use my bathroom

758
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,800
when I'm brushing my teeth.

759
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,520
I got it. I got it.

760
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,600
I won't do it next time.

761
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,930
You are too fastidious.

762
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,200
Then enjoy yourself slowly here.

763
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,930
You shouldn't play it this way.

764
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,180
Fortunately, I prepared in advance.

765
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,080
Oh, no.

766
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,980
Jianjian, hurry. Come to eat.

767
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,960
Coming.

768
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,890
I'm telling you.

769
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,520
Jianjian is in the first year at high school this year.

770
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,640
The two of you are in the third year.

771
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,120
You all go to the same school.

772
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,400
Don't be like that when you were at junior middle school.

773
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,080
Don't let the teachers

774
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
want to see me all day.

775
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,280
You should

776
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,980
behave like her brothers.

777
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,520
OK.

778
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,680
Rest assured, Dad.

779
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,140
I'll take good care of her.

780
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,080
Rest assured, Mr. Li.

781
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,140
I'll take good care of the two of them.

782
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,440
Li Jianjian, Ling Xiao is eating the mochi for you.
