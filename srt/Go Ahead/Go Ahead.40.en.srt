1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 40

4
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,820
What are you doing?

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,910
Why the long face?

6
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,560
We had a great talk

7
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,040
and I like her,

8
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,640
so I invited her

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,970
to have a dinner at home.

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,760
You don't need to explain it.

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,800
You can do whatever you like.

12
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,320
But it has nothing

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,079
to do with me.

14
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
You don't like it

15
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
no matter what I do.

16
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,760
Because you only

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
care about someone else.

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,160
Whatever.

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
But stop doing

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,240
those stupid things.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
I have a girlfriend.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,880
But I don't like her.

23
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,420
You don't have to like her.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,960
I've tried,

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,450
but I really don't like her.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,220
You can be with anyone,

27
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,480
anyone but her.

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,760
I just can't accept her.

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,040
You don't have to accept her.

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,079
I hate her!

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,120
What's wrong

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
with Ling Xiao?

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
It's nothing.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,530
He's got something urgent.

35
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,240
Come. Take a seat.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
I don't know what you like.

38
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,240
Come.

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,290
Have a taste.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,079
Come.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
Have some tea.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,840
Ma'am, thank you.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm too full to have anything else.

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,880
Ling Xiao left

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
just because

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
we had

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
a little quarrel.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,480
You must be upset, right?

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,480
No.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Boys are not like girls.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,480
They're not so caring when they grow up.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,680
Ma'am,

54
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,600
I don't know if I've got it wrong,

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
but if I have,

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
please don't be offended.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,360
What's up?

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,200
It's fine.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,730
I won't be offended. Say it.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,440
Ma'am,

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
I think

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,320
you like me a lot.

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,600
Of course!

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,040
You're pretty

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,000
and you have a good personality.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
You're so likable.

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
Thank you.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,360
But I take Ling Xiao

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,160
as my brother.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,760
Besides,

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
I think what he and Li Jianjian have

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,850
is really great.

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
They grew up

74
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,950
together

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
and they get together

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,850
so many years later.

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,640
They're so in love.

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,530
It's like predestined.

79
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,440
Have some tea, or it'll be cold in a while.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,080
Ma'am,

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,520
you lived in Singapore,

82
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,280
so you might

83
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,640
not know it.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
They've really been close

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,370
since their childhood.

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
And we all envy it.

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,520
How did you know

88
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,200
about things in their childhood?

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,159
Li Jianjian

90
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,680
posted an essay on Tree Hole

91
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,210
which was reposted on Weibo

92
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
and it was trending.

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,840
Everyone in our hospital

94
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,920
has read it.

95
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,420
I'll forward it to you.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,520
OK.

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,160
Please read it.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,080
OK.

99
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,880
OK.

100
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,360
I'll read it when I have time.

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,520
Ma'am,

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
thank you for this meal

103
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,130
and I'll leave you to it.

104
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,410
I'm leaving now.

105
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Sit for a while.

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,560
No, thank you.

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Bye.

108
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Let me see you off.

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,360
No, thank you.

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
I'll ask Chengzi to see you off.

111
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,520
No, thank you.

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,560
Bye.

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,280
Bye.

114
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
So have you persuaded your parents?

115
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,880
My mother won't

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,440
be persuaded

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,240
unless I make some achievement,

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
but I'll continue to fight,

119
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
only in

120
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,090
a different way.

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,960
I will persuade them

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
with my actual deeds.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,760
Well,

124
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
did your parents

125
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,240
really

126
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,640
get a divorce?

127
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,480
Yes.

128
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
Why did your father

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,880
suddenly want a divorce?

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,760
Weren't they a model couple?

131
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,840
Your mother used to be proud that your father always listened to her.

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,940
And my mother used to be proud that I listened to her.

133
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,840
Now it seems

134
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
it's not a great thing to be obedient all the time.

135
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,400
Both your father and you were planning

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,800
something big in secret.

137
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,440
Well,

138
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,720
are you really OK?

139
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,680
I...

140
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm not OK.

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,840
But I force myself

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
not to think about it.

143
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,760
My father used to be

144
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,740
like an invisible man at home,

145
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,000
but he was at home.

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,640
My mom is actually pathetic.

147
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,200
She used to tell me

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
that my father and I were her career,

149
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,840
but now her career

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,140
is a total failure.

151
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,680
So a woman's career

152
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,640
should be improving

153
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,480
and developing herself.

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,530
At critical moments like this,

155
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
we can't depend

156
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,400
on husband or children.

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm back.

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,130
You're back.

159
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,260
What did you have tonight?

160
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,400
Hot pot.

161
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,170
It's quite convenient to have hot pot.

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,960
Why did Feng Xixi get invited?

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Feng Xixi?

164
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,720
I saw

165
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,840
Ling Xiao walk with Feng Xixi

166
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,440
in the residential quarter

167
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,570
after I got off work.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
How many people did Ling Xiao's mother invite

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,970
for their house warming party?

170
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,480
Why did they invite a female colleague of his?

171
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,000
What house warming party?

172
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,240
I invited Zheng Shuran and Du Juan

173
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,880
to have hot pot tonight.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,909
So your future mother-in-law invited

175
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,480
your future husband's female colleague instead of you

176
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
to their house warming party?

177
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,960
How unlikable you are!

178
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,090
My future husband thinks I'm likable.

179
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,380
I really don't understand it.

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,560
Why?

181
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,560
These days, parents

182
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,760
always want their children

183
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,320
to be with someone that they're familiar with,

184
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,160
and Ling Xiao

185
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,290
grew up in your home.

186
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
How could she...

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,560
Were you really annoying

188
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,880
when you were little?

189
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,120
Perhaps.

190
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,200
Back then,

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,180
when they just moved here,

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,640
I sent them

193
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,210
a basket of walnuts.

194
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,890
What’s wrong with walnuts?

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
She doesn't like walnuts?

196
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
I know this.

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,960
Ling Xiao used to have a little sister,

198
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,560
a few years younger than him.

199
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,920
When she went out to play cards,

200
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
she locked the children at home.

201
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,400
That little girl choked on a walnut

202
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
and the door was locked.

203
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,860
Ling Xiao couldn't get out

204
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,200
and then

205
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,320
this kid died.

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,560
Really?

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
I've never heard about it before.

208
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,320
But

209
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
she hates Li Jianjian

210
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,360
just because of a basket of walnuts?

211
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,560
Is she insane?

212
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,600
I don't think

213
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,200
it's because of that.

214
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,320
It's because Li Jianjian knows

215
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
all her skeletons.

216
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,520
Mr. Li

217
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,880
and all their neighbors

218
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,720
know that their daughter died

219
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,520
because she went out to play.

220
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,880
And she abandoned her son

221
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,040
after getting a divorce.

222
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,760
Many years later, she had an accident

223
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
and asked her son to take care of her.

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,580
When she sees Li Jianjian,

225
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,320
it feels like

226
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
being naked.

227
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,530
That's what I think.

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Well,

229
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,120
according to what you've said,

230
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,560
she wants Ling Xiao

231
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,800
to be with anyone

232
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,960
but Li Jianjian.

233
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
So what do you plan to do?

234
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,840
I

235
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
have no plan

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
and I don't intend to.

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
I will cross the bridge when I get to it.

238
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,680
No need bother myself with it now.

239
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,280
Yeah.

240
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,200
OK.

241
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,480
Then I'm relieved.

242
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
I think

243
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,560
as long as you two are in love,

244
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,440
nothing will be a problem.

245
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

246
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,800
That's right!

247
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
Win her over.

248
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,920
Don't stop until you do.

249
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
What a great idea!

250
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,600
Eat something when you drink.

251
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
Eat more meat,

252
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,130
or it'll be bad for your health.

253
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,080
As your father,

254
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,800
I'm useless.

255
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,560
When you don't tell me your problems

256
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm so worried,

257
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,160
but when you tell me about them,

258
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm of no help.

259
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm not a good father as Mr. Li is.

260
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,800
Look,

261
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,370
he's good at cooking

262
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
and straightening things out,

263
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,530
and he's good at chatting with you.

264
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,410
As your father, I...

265
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,800
Dad,

266
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,860
you don't have to do anything.

267
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,920
I feel at ease

268
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,890
when you're with me.

269
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,680
OK.

270
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,840
OK.

271
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,930
When I was in Singapore,

272
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,040
my mom was even worse.

273
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
I wanted to call you

274
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,890
and ask me to take me home

275
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,480
many times.

276
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,760
Xiao,

277
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
I didn't go

278
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
to visit you back then

279
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,400
and I'm sorry.

280
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,920
I know.

281
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,880
I know you have a special job

282
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,520
so you can't visit me.

283
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,850
I don't blame you for it.

284
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,080
Dad,

285
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,140
it's been a long time since the last time I dreamt about Yunyun,

286
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,080
so did she

287
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,210
forgive me already?

288
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
Have I paid off

289
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,240
all my debts to mom?

290
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,920

448
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,400
But I

didn't get wet at all.

450
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,860
Because someone picked me up.

451

who she is?

455
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,800
We know it!

456
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,880
It was your mother!

457
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,000
Yesterday, it rained

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
and your mother went to pick you up

459
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,960
because she didn't want you to get wet in the rain

460
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,840
and she even

461
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,400
walked you home.

462
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,960
So you didn't get wet at all!

463
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,900
You made me jealous in such an early morning.

464
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,640
You blamed me

465
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,360
for keeping everything to myself,

466
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,000
so today

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,440
I want to share my happiness with you.

468
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Isn't it nice?

469
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
Your timing is really great

470
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,480
because we're gloomy right now.

471
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,320
Who is it that's knocking so heavily

472
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,720
at such an early morning?

473
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,840
What's up, Chengzi?

474
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,720
Come inside!

475
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,480
Brother,

476
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,200
mom is gone!

477
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,080
This is her suicide note.

478
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,040
Do you know when she left?

479
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,240
She was watching TV

480
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,970
before I went to bed last night.

481
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But she's gone

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
when I got up this morning.

483
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,200
What to do?

484
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,080
I'll go and look for her!

485
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,540
Where are you going, Xiao?

486
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,210
Have you called the police?

487
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't cry. Don't cry.

488
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
You take care of Chengzi and I'll go with Xiao.

489
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,970
I'll call the police first.

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,720
Ling Xiao,

491
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,080
my son.

492
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm sorry

493
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,560
that I'm not a good mother.

494
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,960
Maybe my being here

495
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,400
is the worst thing for you.

496
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,080
I've been kidnapping you

497
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
with my selfish

498
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,480
and vulnerable love,

499
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,560
and ignoring your feelings.

500
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,610
Over the past few years,

501
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,640
you've done so much for me.

502
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm aware

503
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,840
that you're in misery,

504
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,520
but I'm so helpless.

505
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,760
I lost my daughter

506
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,320
and a car accident

507
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,400
took more things away from me,

508
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,160
my

509
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,040
mother,

510
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,440
my husband

511
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
and my health.

512
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,200
I'm too afraid to keep losing things,

513
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,000
especially you.

514
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
I really regret it.

515
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,240
I should have taken you away with me.

516
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,400
Even when I was breaking down,

517
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,800
even when I couldn't take care of myself,

518
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,640
I should have held your hand

519
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,960
to face it together.

520
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,040
I hate myself for being so weak

521
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,680
and I don't know

522
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,580
which one is the right choice.

523
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,320
I wanted

524
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,440
to make it up to you

525
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,800
with the rest of my life,

526
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,680
but now I'm aware

527
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,720
that I shouldn't have forced you

528
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,760
with my so-called love.

529
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,240
My fate tied me up

530
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,040
to a wheelchair

531
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,040
and I tied you up

532
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,000
to me.

533
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,400
I know you're in pain

534
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
and you can't fall asleep,

535
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,400
but I kept lying to myself.

536
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
I was wrong.

537
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
I was too selfish.

538
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,240
I don't want you

539
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,160
to be with Li Jianjian,

540
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
because I don't want

541
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,800
to recall my past.

542
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,640
I want to have a new life.

543
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,880
But seeing you with her

544
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,280
reminds me

545
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,920
that I once abandoned you

546
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,720
and hurt you.

547
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,480
I don't deserve your love.

548
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes.

549
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,900
I don't deserve to be your mother.

550
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,520
My love is too selfish.

551
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,440
Now I understand

552
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,100
that you've never belonged to me.

553
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,320
You should live your life

554
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,800
the way you want.

555
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,920
This time,

556
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,840
I really want you

557
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,760
to be happy.

558
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,440
And I'll let go of myself.

559
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I'm leaving.

560
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Please take care of Chengzi.

561
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,600
I love you both.

562
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,760
Please forgive me

563
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,040
and then

564
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,370
forget about me.

572
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,280
Mom,

573
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,600
♫We used to rely on each other♫

574
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
you're awake.

575
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,730
You were drowned

576
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
and there's infection in your lungs,

577
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,380
so you need to stay in hospital for a few days.

578
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,940
Luckily, two men were fishing

579
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
at the beach before dawn

580
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,420
and they saved you.

581
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,180
Chengzi was so worried

582
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,600
that she took care of you here for a whole day.

583
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,260
I sent her back for some sleep.

584
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
She read your note

585
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,420
and she felt sorry,

586
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,650
saying that she was mean to you,

587
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,360
so

588
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,420
you said nothing about her

589
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
in your suicide note.

590
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,130
If you think you've done something wrong,

591
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,090
only by being alive, can you make it up.

592
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,080
If you die,

593
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,160
everything stops.

594
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,050
And those wrong things,

595
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,480
bad things

596
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,600
and painful memories

597
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,560
will be there forever

598
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,340
and they won't get better.

599
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,820
Can they still get better?

600
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,160
I remember when I was little,

601
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,040
I had scabs on the back

602
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,220
and it hurt so much.

603
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,200
You said

604
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
the wound will get better

605
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,700
after the pus gets out.

606
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,280
We'll get better.

607
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,600
Look,

608
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920

Mr. Ling.

618
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,960
So? Have you packed up yet?

619
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,640
Yes.

620
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,080
I came to help.

621
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,680
Thank you.

622
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,800
Mom,

623
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,160
hurry up. Mr. Ling is here!

624
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,000
Coming.

625
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,240
Check it

626
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,600
to see if you've left anything.

627
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,440
It’s all here.

628
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,450
I'll start taking things down now.

629
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,240
OK.

630
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,520
Leave it to me.

631
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Thank you.

632
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,400
You're welcome.

633
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,160
Then I'm leaving now.

634
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,760
OK. OK.

635
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm sorry

636
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,120
to have

637
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,520
bothered you with it.

638
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,840
It's no big deal.

639
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,000
Check it

640
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,600
to see if you've left anything.

641
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,400
It’s all here.

642
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,000
Let's go.

643
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,480
Let's go.

644
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,400
I've been waiting for a chance

645
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,530
to apologize to you.

646
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,480
For what?

647
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,640
I answered Ling Xiao's phone

648
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,360
when you called him the other day.

649
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,080
I said

650
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,480
something unpleasant,

651
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,680
so

652
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,490
you committed suicide.

653
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
It was not your fault.

654
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,690
I've told you

655
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,000
it was my fault.

656
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,240
Besides,

657
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,140
after Yunyun was born,

658
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,360
you took care of two kids at home

659
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,240
and I was always away on duty.

660
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,200
At that time,

661
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,320
I knew nothing

662
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,640
about PTSD

663
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,320
and I thought

664
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,650
you would get over with it after some time.

665
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,800
Actually, I've really done

666
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
so many wrong things.

667
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,880
I'm sorry.

668
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,480
Let's not talk about

669
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,740
those unhappy things.

670
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,040
I've forgotten them.

671
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,880
Good.

672
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,680
Good.

673
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,130
I'll settle down in Singapore.

674
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,520
Chengzi likes it

675
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
and I'm used to it,

676
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,000
so please

677
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,360
take good care of Ling Xiao.

678
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,820
I'll take good care of him,

679
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,170
because I'm his father.

680
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,080
That's right!

681
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,040
Here it is.

682
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,080
After you go back,

683
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,960
don't spend all your time on playing.

684
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,400
Mom has difficulty in moving,

685
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,320
so help her

686
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,960
with the housework

687
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,000
like cooking.

688
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,560
Besides,

689
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,560
study hard

690
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,580
to get into a good college.

691
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,440
Ms. Chen Ting,

692
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,560
Ziqiu and I put

693
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,600
some Xiamen special local products for you

694
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,400
in the trunk,

695
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,200
and you can send them to your friends

696
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,130
when you go back.

697
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,520
Thank you.

698
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,640
You're welcome. It's what I should have done.

699
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,680
Thank you, too.

700
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,800
Thank you for taking care of Chengzi

701
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,320
during this period of time.

702
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,250
You're welcome.

703
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,720
Chengzi, now you've learnt

704
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,050
how hard the life can be,

705
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,930
so study hard after you go back.

706
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,450
Then we're leaving now.

707
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,400
Study hard

708
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
and don't spend all your time on playing.

709
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,680
During the Spring Festival,

710
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,280
Jianjian and I

711
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,210
will go and visit you in Singapore.

712
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,240
OK.

713
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,520
Go.

714
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,520
Ziqiu,

715
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
thank you

716
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,180
and I will miss you.

717
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,680
OK.

718
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Come back when you have time.

719
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,130
I'm leaving.

720
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,920
Naughty girl!

721
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,800
Jianjian,

722
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,200
this time,

723
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,290
I'll really leave Ling Xiao to you.

724
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,280
You two take good care of each other.

725
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,680
OK.

726
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,760
Please rest assured.

727
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,000
I'll make him happy.

728
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,240
Ma'am, safe journey!

729
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,680
OK.

730
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Now they've left.

731
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,480
And there's

732
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,240
one hour for you

733
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,040
to put on makeup and get dressed.

734
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
We'll set out when you're ready.

735
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,080
That's right!

736
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,720
I should go and ask Tang Can to put makeup on me,

737
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,850
or it'll be too late.

738
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,840
Let's go. Go.

739
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,190
To get a marriage certificate?

740
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,600
Yes.

741
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,840
It's so sudden.

742
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,560
It seems I should prepare

743
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,520
a red envelope.

744
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,000
Of course!

745
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,920
If you're not short of money, prepare a thick red envelope.

746
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,320
If you're short of money,

747
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,460
borrow some money and prepare a thick red envelope.

748
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,080
Are you a moneygrubber?

749
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,840
I spent a lot of money

750
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,280
and invited everyone I know

751
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,080
to watch

752
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,610
your stage debut tomorrow.

753
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,469
Are you moved?

754
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,920
Don't talk about it.

755
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm nervous even now.

756
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,760
What if

757
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,320
I fail it?

758
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,230
What if I get replaced

759
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,360
by the alternative?

760
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,280
What if the audience boos me?

761
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,210
I'll boo them back with all my friends and relatives.

762
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,710
Love you, babe.

763
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,920
Look at you.

764
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,440
Who is that?

765
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,480
Mrs. Qi.

766
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,120
Tang Can.

767
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,440
Mrs. Qi, you're here.

768
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,240
Jianjian,

769
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,160
both of you are home.

770
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,020
Let me help you.

771
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,060
It's heavy.

772
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,160
Let me do it.

773
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Where is Mingyue?

774
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,680
She went out.

775
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,760
She doesn't have to go to work today,

776
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
does she?

777
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,360
She

778
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,820
went out to buy something.

779
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,120
I've made something delicious

780
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,080
for you.

781
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,040
I didn't bring Shacha sauce this time,

782
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,000
because I remember

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,040
that Tang Can is allergic to it, right?

784
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,370
This time, I've made you

785
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
sweet crispy peanuts.

786
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,240
Do you like it?

787
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
Thank you.

788
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
I like it.

789
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,290
You're welcome.

790
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,560
Look how messy it is!

791
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,920
I'll help you

792
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,960
tidy it up.

793
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,000
I really wonder

794
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,660
if you can be a good housewife.

795
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,360
Let me help you.

796
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,400
No need.

797
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,960
Do what you need to do.

798
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,040
We don't have to worry about it now.

799
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,320
Mrs. Qi

800
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,440
is still Mrs. Qi

801
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,200
who despises us.

802
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,240
That's right.

803
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,920
Dad, hurry up!

804
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,960
Bureau of Civil Affairs Bureau will be off work

805
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,200
if you don't hurry up.

806
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,360
Don't rush me.

807
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,200
Right away.

808
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,080
Ms. He Mei bought him

809
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
a suit

810
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
and he cares so much about his appearance these days.

811
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
You're beautiful today.

812
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,680
And you're handsome.

813
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,800
Give me a kiss.

814
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,000
Have a look.

815
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
What do you think?

816
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,480
Dad, you look great today!

817
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Ms. He Mei has a great taste.

818
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,880
I feel awkward dressing like this.

819
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,000
It's not awkward.

820
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
It looks great on you.

821
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,440
You look so great in it.

822
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,400
Dad,

823
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,440
you really look great today.

824
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,160
Good for you, Dad.

825
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,600
You're having a flash marriage.

826
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,440
Have you been in love for a month?

827
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,420
It's not a flash marriage.

828
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,810
We had a blind date 20 years ago.

829
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,080
OK. Let's go now.

830
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,120
I've put your family register

831
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,380
and ID card in your bag.

832
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,400
They're closer to the bureau

833
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,480
and we should hurry up.

834
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,240
And we'll take a family photo

835
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
after you get the certificate.

836
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,970
This is good.

837
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,980
I need some hairspray.

838
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,450
Dad, you look really great now.

839
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,760
Oh, my!

840
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
Let's go. Go.

841
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,610
You want to transfer your shop?

842
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,160
Yes.

843
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,000
It has begun

844
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,200
to make a profit,

845
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,120
but I'm

846
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,840
a dessert chef

847
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,720
and I want to do desserts.

848
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,040
After I transfer this shop

849
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,760
to someone else,

850
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,720
I want to open

851
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,440
a dessert shop in the scenic zone

852
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,840
and I want Ms. Luo Hong

853
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,440
to help me choose a location.

854
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,320
Is that OK?

855
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,200
Of course!

856
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
I've never expected

857
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,320
that one day

858
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,460
I would take my mom to get married.

859
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,530
My dad will be nice to you

860
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,480
and please be nice to him.

861
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,180
You'll be happy together.

862
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
I wish you happiness!

863
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,440
OK.

864
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,280
You two

865
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,440
are too far away from each other.

866
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,080
You're married now. Hug together!

867
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,320
Like this. Like this.

868
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,600
There's no need for that.

869
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,080
Come on!

870
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720
Man up and hug her!

871
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,120
Hurry up! Hug her!

872
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,400
I'll hug her.

873
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,920
Yes!

874
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,120
Be closer!

875
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,240
Put your arm around her shoulder and look at the camera.

876
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,570
Be closer to each other.

877
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,420
Look at the camera.

878
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,540
Something is missing.

879
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,640
What to do now?

880
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,680
Mom!

881
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,520
You're so beautiful!

882
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,930
This is good.

883
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,890
This one is nice.

884
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Don't let go.

885
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,410
Lean your head over.

886
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
My face has got stiff.

887
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,040
Dad,

888
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,760
we are in the photo studio on the second floor.

889
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,560
Just come up.

890
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,400
Yes.

891
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,720
Not bad. Good.

892
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,920
The traffic is so heavy.

893
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,400
I'm late.

894
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,930
Mr. Ling.

895
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,620
Congratulations!

896
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,000
Congratulations!

897
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
You've finally come.

898
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,160
Come. We were waiting for you to take the family photo.

899
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,640
Yes.

900
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,160
You two get married

901
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,880
and there's no need for me to take the photo with you.

902
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,920
Don't turn us down.

903
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,540
And you're so well dressed

904
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,640
right now.

905
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,680
Besides,

906
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,840
when Jianjian and Ling Xiao get married,

907
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,570
we'll legally become a family.

908
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
That's right!

909
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,120
Come and let's take a photo together.

910
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,920
Come! Come!

911
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,940
Stand behind your mom.

912
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,720
Get ready.

913
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,440
Get ready.

914
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,640
OK. Come.

915
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,600
Come and look at it.

916
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,880
Look at the camera here.

917
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,140
We're about to take it.

918
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,080
Get ready!

919
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,040
Come. One.

920
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,360
Two.

921
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,720
Three!
