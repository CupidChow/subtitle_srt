00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,020
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,860
Episode 29

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,000
What have you been doing these days?

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
You always come home so late.

6
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,190
Nothing.

7
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,280
You have the smell of garbage.

8
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
You have.

9
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,620
Why don't you talk?

10
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,940
I don't want to.

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
Because you'll feel even worse.

12
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,120
Just talk.

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,290
I'm not used to you being quiet.

14
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,720
How much longer

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,920
are you going to act weird in front of me?

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,960
And you always

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,040
hang on alone.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,520
You would rather borrow money from the bank

19
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
than use my money.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,000
Are we still family?

21
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

22
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,320
Of course, we are family.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,240
I always feel

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
people who have ties of blood

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,450
may not become family members,

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,880
but those who cherish and care about each other

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,720
surely can.

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
So, two people can become family members by getting married, right?

29
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,040
By getting married, two people can temporarily

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,370
become family members.

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,680
Once they no longer cherish and care about each other,

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
they will divorce.

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,040
Aunt He Mei and Zhao Huaguang,

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Mr. Ling and Aunt Chen Ting,

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
they have become strangers to each other, right?

36
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,740
Even in your heart,

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
Zhao Huaguang is not your own dad,

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
but our dad is.

39
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
If you feel free

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
to snub your family,

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
no matter how strong your relationship is,

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,290
it will become fragile.

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,520
Just like a kite.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,360
If you fly it

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,520
without taking care of it,

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
and let it

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
be exposed to wind, the sun and rain,

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,960
one day,

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,420
the string will be broken.

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,360
During the years when you and Ling Xiao were abroad,

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,960
didn't we almost

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
break off our relationship?

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,079
What was the problem?

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,079
We didn't come back as promised.

55
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,079
You are not right.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,280
The problem was

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,160
we didn't tell

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,280
our true feelings

59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,079
to each other.

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
The true feelings

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
include the joy

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,460
as well as the pain of life.

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,520
Without pain for comparison,

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,800
joy is meaningless.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,480
I saw what you just said

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,140
on Zheng Shuran's Weibo post.

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,220
That's a summary we made after analyzing mentally.

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,290
Actually, I didn't think much.

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm just unwilling

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,440
to tell you

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,370
unhappy things,

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,080
which will make you unhappy.

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,380
When I'm worried about you, I am unhappy.

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
When you ignore me,

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,040
I feel so sad.

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,040
Really. Really.

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,480
I have a fragile heart.

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,680
It's easy for me to become heartbroken.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
I often think

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,280
you are suffering alone

81
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,360
silently,

82
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,440
and forcing yourself

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
to do something you don't need to do,

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,840
and then my heart begins

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,159
to bleed.

86
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,920
In a flash, I feel

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
life is not fun at all.

88
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
No, Ziqiu.

89
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,880
What are you doing?

90
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,120
You began to talk nonsense again.

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
How come life is not fun at all?

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,240
I can see you

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,200
eat a lot every day.

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,360
Where can you see?

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,640
I can't see you every day.

96
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,170
I can see from your Moments.

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,400
In your studio, you posted

98
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,960
a photo

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,080
of a big meal.

100
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,560
It is more than enough to feed a pig.

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,840
Look. Look.

102
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,570
You are not good to me at all.

103
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
As expected, since childhood,

104
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,800
you've wanted to marry into my family, He Ziqiu.

105
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
You chose Ling Xiao, not me.

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Couldn't I be depressed for a few days?

107
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,080
If I looked happy

108
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,000
as if nothing has happened,

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
wasn't I crazy?

110
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
You are right.

111
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Then, how much longer

112
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,220
are you going to be depressed?

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,120
When you ignore me,

114
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
I feel bad.

115
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,850
I feel uncomfortable everywhere.

116
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,450
You are such a clown.

117
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
Forget it. Forget it.

118
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,810
What do you mean by that?

119
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,020
How many days exactly?

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,960
What are you smiling about?

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,480
Why are you smiling?

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,680
He Ziqiu!

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,320
Hold the dog.

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,050
Ling Xiao, don't open the door.

125
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
What is that?

126
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,420
[Haichao Noodles]

127
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,810
The noodles Dad makes still taste good as before.

128
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
Here are three rules we must observe.

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
Li Jianjian, you must remember these.

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,000
First,

131
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,740
you must be impartial.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,600
You can't favor one more than the other.

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,080
Second,

134
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
if your boyfriend

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,800
has a quarrel with your brother,

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
you must be on your brother's side.

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Third,

138
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,920
if your boyfriend is not good to you,

139
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
I'll beat him.

140
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,680
He Ziqiu.

141
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,240
That's right.

142
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Li Jianjian, you know what?

143
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,360
Mrs. Zhang

144
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,820
is going to chase your dad.

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,940
Mrs. Zhang has good taste.

146
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,240
Who is Mrs. Zhang?

147
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
Didn't Li Jianjian tell you?

148
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Mrs. Qian introduced a girlfriend

149
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
to Mr. Li.

150
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
She is a teacher and well-educated.

151
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
She looks really elegant.

152
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
Why haven't I heard Dad say anything about it?

153
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,220
It seems that Mr. Li doesn't like her.

154
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,640
What does my dad say?

155
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,560
He says they don't fit.

156
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,690
So he isn't into her.

157
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,120
Is my dad a face-judger?

158
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,080
I think he likes

159
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,960
good-looking women.

160
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,890
I don't think so.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Probably.

162
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,340
Jianjian's mom looks pretty.

163
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,600
So does your mom.

164
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,490
That's true.

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
Buying food with you today,

166
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
I really increased my knowledge.

167
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,920
Speaking of cooking,

168
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I can't stop.

169
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Mrs. Zhang.

170
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,730
Please don't...

171
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,810
Why are you all back?

172
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,159
Ling Xiao has a day off today.

173
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
This is Mrs. Zhang Hongying.

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
You,

175
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
you are Jianjian, right?

176
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,320
You look so pretty.

177
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Your dad says

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,020
you resemble your mom.

179
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Hello, Mrs. Zhang.

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Hello.

181
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,720
Give it to me. It is heavy.

182
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
It is too heavy. Don't carry it.

183
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,920
No, no. Don't carry it. It is too heavy.

184
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,480
Let me carry this.

185
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
Mrs. Zhang, let me carry it. Come on.

186
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,880
Thank you. Thank you.

187
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,600
Between these two handsome young men,

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
which is Ziqiu

189
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,180
and which is Ling Xiao?

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,160
Slow down. Slow down.

191
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,720
Mrs. Zhang, I am, I am Ziqiu.

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm Ling Xiao.

193
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,600
Good.

194
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,240
Be seated.

195
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,100
Continue to eat. Continue to eat.

196
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
Your dad promised

197
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,080
to teach me make toppings.

198
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,400
Good. Whatever my dad makes, it tastes good.

199
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
You can learn a lot from him.

200
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,320
OK.

201
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,049
I'm not good at cooking.

202
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,909
But my eldest son

203
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,669
is good at making Western-style food.

204
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,120
Come to eat it at my home another day.

205
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,640
OK.

206
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,320
OK. Then...

207
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,960
Well.

208
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,280
Mrs. Zhang,

209
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,440
how about

210
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,600
you go to the kitchen

211
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
to prepare the ingredients first?

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,840
Do as what I told you

213
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
on the way.

214
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I want to have a word with the children.

215
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,600
OK. OK.

216
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,040
You guys talk.

217
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm going to the kitchen first.

218
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:54,920
Good.

219
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,050
I'll join you later.

220
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
The three children are good.

221
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,640
How could you agree

222
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
to eat at her home?

223
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,760
Right.

224
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,400
What's going on?

225
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,240
You even

226
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
bought food together.

227
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
Don't wink.

228
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,740
We came across each other in the food market.

229
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,680
Encounter. Encounter.

230
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
Maybe you'll encounter her

231
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,320
every day.

232
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,360
Stop it.

233
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,280
Dad, she has sons?

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,690
She has two sons.

235
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,410
After you get married with her,

236
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,220
Li Jianjian will have two more brothers, right?

237
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,040
If they don't live together, it won't matter.

238
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
No, I don't agree.

239
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,840
I agree.

240
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,600
What are you

241
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,760
talking about?

242
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,400
It is

243
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
still uncertain.

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,040
I know. I know.

245
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
It doesn't matter. You can try to get along with each other first

246
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,370
to see whether you like her.

247
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,080
Come on.

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm not a young man.

249
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,400
How can I say whether I like her or not?

250
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,760
You are getting on in years, but why

251
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,680
can't you like a woman?

252
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
Why can't you have love?

253
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
Don't regard me as kid.

254
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,290
You'll have.

255
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Love.

256
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,600
People of our generation

257
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
were not good at developing a romantic relationship when we were young,

258
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,520
let alone when we are not young now.

259
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,480
Actually, I'm living a good life now.

260
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,760
Heping and I

261
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,780
help each other

262
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,560
to live.

263
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
It's good.

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
Why do you say it's good?

265
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,360
My dad doesn't do anything

266
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,290
but gives money.

267
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,460
What kind of help can you get from him?

268
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,400
With money, a man is a real man; without money, a man is good for nothing.

269
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,440
Without money, it is hard for a man to support his family, you know.

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
Young man, you can't underestimate the importance of money.

271
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,290
Money is still very important.

272
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,560
Moreover,

273
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,610
isn't it just about having one more person to eat?

274
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,360
Mr. Li,

275
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,540
I'm not like my dad.

276
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,240
If I can't balance

277
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
my career and family,

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,920
taking care of my family is my priority.

279
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,800
Well.

280
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,000
Good.

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,120
You are a good child.

282
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,650
Whoever will marry you must be very happy.

283
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,800
So, Mr. Li,

284
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,200
you can rest assured to let me take care of Jianjian.

285
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,260
I can rest assured.

286
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Of course, I...

287
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
What? The two of you...

288
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,280
Dad, don't worry.

289
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,760
If they don't get along with each other,

290
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,880
I'll take his position.

291
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
You'll be the substitute.

292
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
I'll replace him.

293
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,600
Well.

294
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
Dad, don't worry about us.

295
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,640
We, we'll see to it.

296
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
We'll see to it.

297
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,840
You'll see to it?

298
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,680
Haichao,

299
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
the ingredients are ready. Come on.

300
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,320
OK. Wait a moment, I...

301
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,240
OK, OK. My dad will be there soon.

302
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
Soon, Mrs. Zhang.

303
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Hurry.

304
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
Don't smile. Tell me, Jianjian...

305
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
Dad, hurry.

306
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,760
Go to the kitchen to help her

307
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,020
with the ingredients.

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,320
We'll go back home after finishing the meal.

309
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,960
Come on. Come on.

310
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,920
Make it clear to me.

311
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,040
Get in.

312
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
Actually, I think...

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
Get in.

314
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Take the initiative.

315
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,200
oh god.

316
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,620
A franc for your thoughts.

317
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
In America they bring only

318
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,040
a penny.

319
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,080
I guess that's about all they're worth.

320
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,930
But I'm willing to be overcharged.

321
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,320
Tell me.

322
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,740
And I was wondering...

323
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
Why I'm so lucky,

324
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,960
why I should find you

325
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,040
waiting for me

326
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,920
to come along?

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,640
Why there is no other man

328
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,440
in my life?

329
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
That's easy.

330
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
There was.

331
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,120
And he's dead.

332
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
I'm sorry for asking.

333
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I forgot we said no questions.

334
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,160
Sorry for keeping you waiting today.

335
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,420
We were two hours late.

336
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
I took my grandpa to the hospital for examination.

337
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
And it delayed us.

338
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,320
It doesn't matter. He is an elderly man.

339
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,420
How is the result of examination?

340
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,000
He has Alzheimer's disease.

341
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,660
It's getting worse and worse.

342
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,680
I guess he

343
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,340
can only remember my grandma.

344
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,280
Especially the film

345
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,410
he and my grandma saw

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,610
on their first date.

347
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,320
On the street in a foreign country,

348
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
when a man sees the one he loves

349
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,320
walking towards him from a distance,

350
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
she just got off work and hasn't

351
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
had time to get changed,

352
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,560
but there is a bright smile

353
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,600
on her face.

354
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,760
He will never forget such highlight moments

355
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,960
in his life, right?

356
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Thank you very much.

357
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,040
Otherwise, my grandpa

358
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,320
would say he wants to see the film again after a period.

359
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,840
"I'm going to be late. I'm going to be late."

360
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,560
I don't know

361
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,520
what I should do.

362
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,160
Not at all. You paid me.

363
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,850
Thank you, Tang Can.

364
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,240
See you next time.

365
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,420
Call me at any time.

366
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,380
[Zhuang Bei's mom]

367
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,160
Hello?

368
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
Didn't Zhuang Bei tell you?

369
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
I've been busy with something else recently.

370
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,560
So, I don't have time to accept orders.

371
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,160
Please apply for a refund.

372
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,280
No, no.

373
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm not short of money.

374
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,200
Don't confirm payment.

375
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,970
Mrs. Zhuang?

376
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,240
Hello?

377
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
[Zhuang Bei]

378
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,280
Hello? Did you tell your mom?

379
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,370
You are here.

380
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,920
What kind of clients

381
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,840
do you receive?

382
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,770
Do you need to be dressed like this?

383
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,800
What you would like to drink?

384
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm not here to drink coffee.

385
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Come to the point.

386
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Here is the thing.

387
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,360
Can you

388
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
hold out for a period?

389
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Are you crazy?

390
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,360
Look.

391
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,600
My grandma is going to spend

392
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
her 70th birthday soon.

393
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,680
But I'll be away on official business

394
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,740
in Guangzhou then.

395
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,640
My mom has talked big.

396
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,520
Your mom is not going to take me there

397
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,320
but her son's

398
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,240
girlfriend.

399
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,840
A very filial one.

400
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
Find one quickly.

401
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,200
This time,

402
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,240
you have to go.

403
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,520
Because she has shown the photo of you

404
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,920
to many people.

405
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
Tell them we've broken up.

406
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,170
I've dumped you.

407
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,960
OK?

408
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,650
Wait. You...

409
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,160
Then my mom

410
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
will be disgraced?

411
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,120
Does that have anything

412
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,200
to do with me?

413
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,320
She is not my mom.

414
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,120
Come on, Can.

415
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,800
Please. Please help me.

416
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,560
Let go of me.

417
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,560
Tang Can, let me explain it to you.

418
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
It's not like what you think.

419
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,140
Qi Mingyue doesn't know this.

420
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,650
Didn't you take a photo of the two of us?

421
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,300
Where is the part of me?

422
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,360
I got it.

423
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,220
I'm the one whose part was cut.

424
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Tang Can.

425
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,840
What can we do?

426
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,160
The interest on cash advance of credit card

427
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,490
is really a lot of money.

428
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,960
Whatever I say,

429
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,480
Ziqiu doesn't want my money.

430
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm so mad.

431
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,160
He is like that. He refuses to accept help out of a false sense of dignity.

432
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,069
He refuses to accept Zhao Huaguang's money.

433
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,930
His coffee shop is unprofitable.

434
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,920
As a man whose dad is rich,

435
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,780
he has to tighten his belt to live.

436
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,829
That's easy.

437
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,390
Pay his credit card debt for him.

438
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,300
Who knows his credit card number?

439
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,560
I know.

440
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,109
You know?

441
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,260
Do you want to know?

442
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,100
Do something to please me.

443
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Why are you looking around?

444
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,440
There is nobody else at home.

445
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,080
OK?

446
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
Once again.

447
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,520
I...

448
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Who is at home?

449
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The two of you are.

450
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,800
Dad, why are you back?

451
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,120
My shirt is dirty,

452
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,580
so I'm back to get changed.

453
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,000
Ling Xiao,

454
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,080
buy me some plasters.

455
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,280
Choose the brand I often use.

456
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,440
OK. I'm going right now.

457
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
What are you doing?

458
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,160
It is scary when you are looking at me like this.

459
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,890
What's going on with you and Ling Xiao?

460
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,560
Just as you can see.

461
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,690
What do you mean by that?

462
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Since childhood, you've been wanting to stay with Ling Xiao.

463
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,800
Did you...

464
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,920
No, no.

465
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,850
Absolutely not.

466
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,680
I swear.

467
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,740
So, what's the matter?

468
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,320
We didn't,

469
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,960
but

470
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
Ling Xiao is a person of excellent character and handsome looks,

471
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,440
and he has been liking me for many years.

472
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
So I don't want to be picky.

473
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,560
You are right.

474
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,880
I thought you would

475
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,520
completely agree, Dad.

476
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,280
But it seems that

477
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,600
you don't look happy.

478
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm fully satisfied with Ling Xiao.

479
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,880
But I'm not sure about his mom.

480
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
It is polite to say

481
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,580
that his mom doesn't like our family.

482
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,600
She hates us very much.

483
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
Will she agree?

484
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,280
I think she will.

485
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,280
It seems that she has become good.

486
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,440
When she called Ling Xiao

487
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
last time,

488
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
I was with him.

489
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
And she spoke to me.

490
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,920
I feel that she is kind.

491
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,920
Really?

492
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,920
Yes.

493
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,640
Perhaps as she

494
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
is getting on in years,

495
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,840
she naturally becomes amiable.

496
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,320
Even if she doesn't like me,

497
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
so what?

498
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
We live in different places.

499
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

500
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,480
We won't interfere with each other.

501
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,320
It'll be fine.

502
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,660
I'm afraid she'll make things difficult for Ling Xiao.

503
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,480
Dad,

504
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,600
you don't need to worry about us.

505
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,850
We are young people.

506
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
You'd better think about

507
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,520
your marriage.

508
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,300
Mrs. Zhang is really a good woman.

509
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,370
I like her since I saw her last time.

510
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,640
You can learn anything,

511
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,760
but why do you learn from Mrs. Qian

512
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,080
to be a matchmaker?

513
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,760
Come on.

514
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,460
I won't talk to you.

515
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm going to get changed.

516
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Don't be shy.

517
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,800
Let's talk. Come on.

518
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,130
Let's talk. Let's talk.

519
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
I'm getting changed. Get out.

520
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,120
Tell me your attitude first.

521
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,680
Get out first.

522
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,810
Tell me your attitude and I'll get out.

523
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,960
I hereby apply for it.

524
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,600
Hope to be approved.

525
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,840
Applicant: Qi Mingyue.

526
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,860
[Application for Job Transfer to Beijing]

527
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,760
OK.

528
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,800
Mom.

529
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,140
Have you eaten?

530
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,160
Yes.

531
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,120
I want to ask

532
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,880
whether you've

533
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
been studying recently.

534
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,720
I'm reading the book.

535
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm memorizing the knowledge.

536
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Really?

537
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Don't go through the motions by just holding the book.

538
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,960
Look.

539
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
This notebook is filled with notes.

540
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
I can't see it clearly.

541
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,040
Well.

542
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,560
I know you'll

543
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,680
study hard.

544
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,360
I was just kidding.

545
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,800
Is there anything else you want to say?

546
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,240
If no, I'm going to continue to memorize the knowledge.

547
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,000
OK. OK.

548
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,460
I won't disturb you. Go on.

549
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,680
I love you. Muah!

550
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
You even said muah.

551
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,600
♫Light is hidden in the night by the sunset♫

552
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,880
♫But the sleepless stars dismantle the darkness♫

553
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,600
♫The night sky won't be dark♫

554
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
♫As long as the moonlight shines through the chinks♫

555
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,920
♫If you ask the night sky♫

556
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,920
♫About the twists and turns before dawn♫

557
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,440
♫It's just the past which will be gone tomorrow♫

558
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,440
♫So silence requires not too much talk♫

559
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,520
♫It just bears with everything♫

560

♫Every time when I look back in despair♫

561
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,600
♫Every time when I'm disheartened♫

♫How similar the night sky is to me♫

♫It has the unyielding colors♫

♫The mood coated with a jacket♫

♫The unhappiness tagged with a price♫

566
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,500
Can we not be like this?

567
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Hold on. We have to hide.

568
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,440
This is too silly.

569
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,280
People peep like this.

570
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,340
Let's have another look. Have another look.

571
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,940
Where is he?

572
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
You are following me?

573
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,960
I intended to follow you,

574
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
but Ling Xiao said there's no need

575
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,680
to be so troublesome.

576
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,520
I did something to your cellphone

577
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
so I can find you wherever you are.

578
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,480
When did you

579
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
get my cellphone?

580
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,860
One day when you were taking a shower.

581
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Besides, Ling Xiao secretly

582
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,000
paid back

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,760
your credit card debt

584
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,720
and deleted all

585
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,920
repayment messages.

586
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,320
He was so good at keeping secret.

587
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,560
He didn't tell me.

588
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,360
He even deliberately fooled me.

589
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,680
Who asked you to mind my business?

590
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,040
How could you say that?

591
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,800
He was worried about you.

592
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,680
He said he wouldn't mind your business,

593
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,520
but quietly

594
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,080
he solved the problem for you.

595
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,720
Gosh. He didn't want you to think much.

596
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
So touching.

597
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,600
This is deep love.

598
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,320
When we were children,

599
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,280
it was like this, right?

600
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,200
We made trouble,

601
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,240
and Ling Xiao solved the problem for us.

602
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,680
Watch your table manners.

603
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,010
Who wants him to do that?

604
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,850
I have no choice.

605
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
My girlfriend is worried about you.

606
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,360
You are showing your affection, right?

607
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,520
Get out to show it.

608
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,680
The interest on cash advance of credit card

609
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,720
is so high.

610
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,960
Why don't you let me get the interest instead of the bank?

611
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,800
OK. OK.

612
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,650
I'll pay you both principal and interest.

613
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,410
But you've known

614
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,780
that I come out to work in the evening,

615
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,280
not to spend money

616
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,240
in those places.

617
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,760
But Ziqiu,

618
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,160
you work in the cake shop in the daytime,

619
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,490
and here in the evening.

620
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
Aren't you tired?

621
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,880
Young people

622
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,960
are all tired.

623
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,050
For example, Ling Xiao.

624
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,960
He often works overtime till nine o'clock at night.

625
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,600
Since you have time to worry about me,

626
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,240
you'd better worry about your boyfriend.

627
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,280
Without end?

628
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,840
Well. Well.

629
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm going to work.

630
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,320
What else do you want to eat?

631
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,080
Chocolate.

632
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,640
OK.

633
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,400
She can't have so much

634
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,860
sweet food in the evening.

635
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,400
She is not fat, so why don't you

636
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
allow her to eat?

637
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,280
Is it really good to spoil her like this?

638
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,400
Don't think I don't know

639
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,320
that you always put cake

640
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,120
in the fridge.

641
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,120
Well. Forget it.

642
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,850
Don't be mad with me.

643
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,040
I eat only a piece of cake every day.

644
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,600
Really.

645
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,840
Snow Egg, you are waiting here.

646
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,260
You are hungry, right?

647
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,560
These are all you love to eat.

648
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,720
We've already closed...

649
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,960
What brings you here?

650
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,280
Good.

651
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,000
No need to rush. Chew more.

652
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Take your time.

653
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,840
If you love it, eat slowly.

654
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,170
If it is not enough, I'll cook more for you.

655
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,450
Dongdong also likes the fish balls

656
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,920
I took back last time.

657
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,880
What children like to eat

658
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
are similar.

659
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,420
I've gained experience after cooking a lot.

660
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,040
Why do you want

661
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
to see me at night?

662
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,880
To just take the child here

663
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
to have a bowl of noodles?

664
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,120
Zhao Huaguang has another son.

665
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,530
He is five years old now.

666
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Last year, he took him back from abroad to offer sacrifices to his ancestors.

667
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,840
I asked someone

668
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,120
to inquire about it in his hometown.

669
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,450
He held a grand banquet,

670
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,000
with dinner served separately as the guests arrived in succession, and it lasted for three days.

671
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,560
He even invited a song and dance ensemble to perform there.

672
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,000
Those who having fame and prestige in the local area

673
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,600
were invited to the banquet.

674
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,800
I wondered

675
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,440
why he is willing

676
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,800
to let Ziqiu come back.

677
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,200
I thought

678
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Ziqiu was hiding something

679
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,240
from me.

680
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,360
He is hiding something from you.

681
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
People of my beauty salon

682
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,920
ate together in a buffet restaurant.

683
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,960
To my surprise, I found Ziqiu

684
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
working there.

685
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,400
I asked

686
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,760
the manager of the restaurant.

687
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,880
Pastry chefs need to work from 4:00 p.m.

688
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,280
to 10:00 p.m.

689
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,370
Do you have Zhao Huaguang's phone number?

690
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,360
Yes, yes.

691
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,840
But I haven't called him for long.

692
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,240
I don't know whether he has changed his number or not.

693
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,300
Give me the number.

694
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,880
Why do you want his number?

695
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,860
I want to ask him

696
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,040
why Ziqiu is short of money.

697
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,850
Give it to me now.

698
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Speak in Chinese.

699
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,050
Can't you see the number is from China?

700
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,960
Me,

701
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,320
He Mei.

702
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Do you still remember me?

703
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,840
Don't talk those useless things.

704
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,700
I want to ask you

705
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,690
why Ziqiu is short of money.

706
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,320
You don't know?

707
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,260
Zhao Huaguang,

708
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,700
make it clear to me.

709
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,960
Fine.

710
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,400
You care about your reputation, right?

711
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,730
I'll go to your hometown

712
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,920
and tell the people

713
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,180
with a big loudspeaker

714
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,290
how you gradually became a rich man

715
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,820
by relying on a woman for financial support.

716
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
You know about me.

717
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,320
Don't you know

718
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,080
whether I dare to do it or not?

719
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Tell me now.

720
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,250
Although he stayed with me,

721
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,680
his heart is still with the Li family.

722
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,560
He never calls me dad.

723
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,840
So, I wanted

724
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,720
to cut off his source of income

725
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,440
to see whether he would be convinced.

726
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,600
But this brat,

727
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,040
he worked

728
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,760
to earn money to pay for his tuition and living expenses.

729
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,480
He managed to support himself.

730
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,680
When did that happen?

731
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,540
Six or seven years ago.

732
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,760
I still care about him.

733
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,280
I just want him

734
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
to call me dad

735
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
and break off with the Li family.

736
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,760
I can give them more money.

737
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,160
He thought he was my only son,

738
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,610
so he put on airs.

739
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,240
Now I have another son.

740
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,920
If Ziqiu is short of money,

741
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,440
why didn't he ask me for it?

742
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,180
He asked you to call me?

743
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
He accepted you as his mom?

744
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,300
I didn't raise him,

745
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,240
so I won't rely on him to take care of me.

746
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,040
Zhao Huaguang, I'm telling you.

747
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm not afraid of you.

748
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,200
You are rascally.

749
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,930
I'll be more rascally than you.

750
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,440
You must give Ziqiu

751
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,320
all that you should have given him these years.

752
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,380
You are on your own.

753
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,760
Thank you.

754
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,080
Dongdong?

755
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Dongdong?

756
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,680
Dongdong, you can't eat that.

757
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,160
This can't be eaten. Come on.

758
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,400
It can't be eaten, Dongdong.

759
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Right. It can't be eaten.

760
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,240
Dongdong.

761
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,520
This is the dog's food, you know?

762
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,240
Dirty.

763
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,560
I'll take him to wash hands.

764
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,240
Let me. Let me take him to.

765
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,000
Dongdong, if you like,

766
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,860
I'll cook more for you, OK?

767
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,280
Let's go

768
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,440
to wash your little hands.

769
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Let's go. Let's wash your little hands.

770
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,100
Let's wash your little hands.

771
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,120
Well.

772
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,600
Dongdong is like this since he was very little?

773
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
Autism?

774
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
It is not congenital.

775
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
It is acquired.

776
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I've been taking him to see doctors.

777
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,440
Life must be hard for you.

778
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,600
Perhaps.

779
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,480
If everyone

780
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
thinks so,

781
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,360
then life is hard for me.

782
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,810
I haven't thought about it.

783
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,040
Someone told me

784
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,960
that we can't stop

785
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,120
to think too much.

786
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,810
We should live confusedly.

787
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Time passes

788
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,040
in a twinkle of an eye.

789
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,720
Right.

790
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,580
What you said makes sense.

791
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,960
I've spent these years

792
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,040
confusedly too.

793
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,480
I couldn't see him,

794
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,880
or hear about him.

795
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,380
How was everything

796
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,880
with Ziqiu

797
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,640
when he was abroad?

798
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,720
I have no idea at all.

799
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,640
I couldn't help.

800
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,740
I'm just a poor dad running a noodle restaurant.

801
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm not capable.

802
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,370
I'm useless.

803
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,680
You are not capable?

804
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,840
You've taken care of three children alone.

805
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
None of us can do that.

806
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,920
That's nothing.

807
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,240
I can only cook.

808
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,760
Come on. Here's to you.

809
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,960
OK.

810
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,190
Are you crazy?

811
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,230
You are really like your mom.

812
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,630
You can't say anything good even if I give you money?

813
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,920
Give me your card number.

814
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,880
I'll transfer money to you right now.

815
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,840
I've told you

816
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,520
I don't want your money.

817
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,520
Ziqiu, will money prick your hands?

818
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,880
In addition to attending classes,

819
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,600
you went to work in the restaurant.

820
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,360
You've lived such a life for a few years, right?

821
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,880
You should have known

822
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,230
how important money is.

823
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,150
I've been waiting for you to turn back.

824
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,280
Admit your mistake.

825
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,040
Of course I know

826
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,440
the importance of money.

827
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,670
Only by making money myself

828
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,120
can I master my own life.

829
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,120
Over these years,

830
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,760
I've learned that.

831
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,690
Do you know that?

832
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,360
Come on. You can forgive He Mei,

833
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,760
but why can't you forgive me?

834
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Why did you keep mentioning her?

835
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,080
I don't even know her.

836
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,760
Then why did she know

837
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,960
that you are short of money

838
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,090
and call to scold me?

839
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,680
What?

840
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,200
Ziqiu,

841
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm begging you. OK?

842
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,320
I apologize to you. OK?

843
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,440
Tell me

844
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,200
what else do you want?

845
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Ziqiu.

846
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Ziqiu?

847
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
You can forgive He Mei,

848
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,320
but why can't you forgive me?

849
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,840
Why did you keep mentioning her?

850
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,040
I don't even know her.

851
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,240
Then why did she know

852
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,640
that you are short of money

853
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,770
and call to scold me?

854
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,200
Ziqiu, have watermelon.

855
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,930
What's going on?

856
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,000
Ziqiu! Ziqiu!

857
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,920
He Ziqiu!

858
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,480
He Ziqiu!

859
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
This is not a good way to find him.

860
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,800
Mingyue, go back with Tang Can first.

861
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,800
Jianjian and I will continue.

862
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,720
OK. We'll go back first.

863
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,940
Why do you have tears in your eyes?

864
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,920
It'll be fine. Ling Xiao and I will find him.

865
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,480
You guys go back.

866
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,680
We'll call you.

867
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,720
Be careful.

868
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,690
Go back. Go back.

869
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,560
Let's go.

870
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,560
You like He Ziqiu again?

871
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

872
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,920
Why did you cry?

873
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,160
I have bad luck.

874
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,960
What a comedian you are!

875
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,140
Let's go. Let's go.

876
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,480
Ziqiu loved to eat noodles and he...

877
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,480
♫Bearing the burden♫

878
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,200
My daughter is calling.

879
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
♫And suffering the loss♫

880
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,360
♫But we still look forward to the future♫

881
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,320
Jianjian, what's up?

882
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,040
♫Maybe you are trying hard♫

883
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,880
Ziqiu ran outside?

884
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,600
♫to forget that♫

885
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,760
Don't rush.

886
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,120
What do you mean?

887
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,920
♫just as I am♫

888
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,760
He Mei!

889
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,440
Open the door!

890
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,840
He Mei!

891
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,280
Open the door!

892
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:30,520
♫Even if you hesitate, you will carry on♫

893
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,000
♫Life♫

894
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
♫In a roundabout way♫

895
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,480
♫Tell us♫

896
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,600
♫To be fearless♫

897
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,160
Sir, here is the food for you.

898
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,800
Thank you.

899
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,880
Sir, may I help you?

900
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,840
Good.

901
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
You are here to study.

902
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
But you've learned

903
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,560
how to serve tea

904
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,000
and bend down to serve people.

905
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It is thus clear that

906
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,360
what you saw and heard in your childhood is very important.

907
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,020
You are doing well as a waiter.

908
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,680
What would you like to have?

909
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,740
You've graduated.

910
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,540
How is your job hunting going?

911
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,640
Are you going to return to China?

912
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,200
You'd better look at the menu first.

913
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,760
Ziqiu,

914
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,050
two years is enough, right?

915
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,520
It is not easy to earn money yourself, right?

916
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,360
Do you really expect

917
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,280
to become a millionaire

918
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,340
by starting from working as a waiter?

919
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,040
Fine.

920
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,520
I

921
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,240
won't force you to change your surname.

922
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
You are so stubborn.

923
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,620
You indeed should be surnamed He.

924
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,040
You are my own son.

925
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,770
You are suffering outside.

926
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
Do you think

927
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,920
I don't feel bad?

928
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,180
As long as you break off with the Li family...

929
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,200
Stop!

930
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,640
Do you think

931
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,280
you are my only son,

932
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,120
so I'll count on you?

933
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,940
That's what you think.

934
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,580
That's what I thought.

935
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,090
I'm telling you.

936
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,380
My wife has given birth to a child.

937
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,080
A son.

938
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,480
As long as you break off

939
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,760
with the Li family,

940
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,560
you and

941
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,680
your brother will each get

942
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,360
half of my family possessions.

943
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
If you are still so obstinate,

944
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,280
from today on,

945
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,400
you'll

946
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,570
have nothing

947
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,680
to do with me.

948
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,480
Even if you beg me,

949
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,400
it won't help.

950
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
I don't want you,

951
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
not that you don't want me.

952
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,170
Understand?

953
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,680
You should have said that

954
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,600
four years ago.

955
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,560
Why didn't you say that earlier?

956
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,280
You are really here.

957
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,800
Where is the other shoe?

958
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,530
How come there is only one here?

959
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,170
Let me check.

960
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,400
Fortunately, your foot is not broken.

961
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,680
So dirty.

962
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,040
Come on. Put it on.

963
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,520
What's wrong with you at night?

964
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
Couldn't you tell us if anything happened?

965
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,760
Ziqiu, my neck.

966
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,220
You are strangling me.

967
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,040
You are strangling me. My neck.

968
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,680
Ziqiu,

969
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,920
Ziqiu, you are strangling her.
