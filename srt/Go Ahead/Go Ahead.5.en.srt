00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 5

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I have duck necks!

5
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,760
They might be cold, right?

6
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Then don't eat any if you think they are cold.

7
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,820
Of course I'll eat.

8
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,840
As I expected, you aren't wearing your coat.

9
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,600
Put it on, or you might get a cold.

10
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,530
Dinner is ready.

11
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,560
Come on,

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,000
Give me a coke.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,930
…this is for you.

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,960
This is mine.

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,260
Hmm, it tastes authentic!

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,290
Is Mr. Li asleep?

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,120
Yes,

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,280
and he has to get up

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,880
at 4 o'clock tomorrow morning for dough-making.

20
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Have you seen any meteor?

21
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
It is said in the news that the meteor shower will come at 1 o'clock in the early morning,

22
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,600
but it's still before midnight now.

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
Can we wait until the meteor shower arrives?

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,720
Two years ago,

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,480
we waited for the meteor shower of Andromeda,

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,560
didn't we?

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,800
But we saw nothing

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
and even got stung all over by mosquitoes.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
It is different this time.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,160
You see,

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,720
it was raining then,

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,240
while it is quite fine today.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,079
Besides, it seems to be

34
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,280
the Leonid meteor shower

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,240
which occurs once every 50 years.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,770
We will definitely see it. Let's wait and see.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Recently I've gained much weight

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,740
because I've eaten too much at night.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,020
Then just eat less.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,480
I'm at the age of physical growth.

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,360
Physical growth?

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,880
Just take a look at your tummy flab.

43
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,520
Ziqiu!

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,640
I'll knock you off!

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,880
I wonder

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,210
when the meteor shower is going to arrive.

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
It's just a plane.

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,760
You didn't ask your mother

49
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,400
why she left you alone and went away,

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,320
did you?

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,480
No.

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,810
You aren’t curious?

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,480
No.

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,560
OK.

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
I know the reason,

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,340
so I never wonder that.

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,970
She didn't mean to leave me,

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,240
but to leave all her

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,640
past belongings behind.

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,100
It turns out that we are just belongings.

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,140
So you needn't think too much.

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,400
If your mother wants to get you back,

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,860
she will come back to do so.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,760
She feels free to abandon me

65
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
or get me back.

66
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,880
Who does she think she is?

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,820
She's your mother.

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,200
How do you feel

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,180
about your mother coming back for you this time?

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,520
Nothing,

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,010
but I feel noisy.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,120
However,

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
I feel relieved in my mind

74
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
as I know

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,340
that she is living a good life now.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,800
What?

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,080
You've gotten mentally prepared in advance

78
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,120
in case your mother suddenly comes back for you?

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
Mentally prepared?

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
If she comes back,

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,880
I'll ask her

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
for my dad's money

83
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,410
and then drive her away.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
You think

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,659
I'm as timid as you are?

86
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
I hope so.

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,060
Look, is that a meteor?

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
Wake up, Jianjian, there's a meteor!

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
There's a meteor

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
There's a meteor!

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,200
Get up!

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,880
♫Light is hidden in the night by the sunset♫

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
A meteor!

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,700
This is the first time I've seen a meteor!

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
♫but the sleepless stars dismantle the darkness♫

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Why do you act as a maiden?

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,400
Making a wish doesn't cost me a penny anyway,

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,440
and it doesn't matter even if it's not fulfilled.

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,880
♫The night sky won't be dark♫

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Mom!

101
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Here I am!

102
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you see me?

103
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,960
♫as long as the moonlight shines through the chinks♫

104
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,640
Mom!

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,160
♫If you ask the night sky♫

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,320
Here I am!

107
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,160
♫about the twists and turns before dawn♫

108
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,680
♫It's just the past which will be gone tomorrow♫

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,640
Mom!

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you see me?

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,680
♫So silence requires not too much talk♫

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
Alas, come on!

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,240
No!

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
I don't want to visit Li Jianjian's.

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
We are not visiting Li Jianjian's,

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,080
we are going to Haichao Noodles for dinner

117
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,440
and visit your brother there, by the way.

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
You are a liar.

119
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,240
I won't trust you anymore.

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,840
I'm a liar?

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,000
When did I lie to you?

122
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,800
You said that my brother missed me,

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,460
and that he'd like me for sure.

124
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,080
But he only likes Li Jianjian

125
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,480
and ignores me!

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
He likes you,

127
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,040
but he can't accept this all of a sudden.

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
I want to go back to Singapore

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,920
instead of staying here!

130
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I don't know any schoolmates here.

131
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,920
We won't be staying here

132
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,840
all the time,

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,160
and we will go back after the Spring Festival.

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,800
Besides,

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
you've told your schoolmates

136
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
that you have an elder brother.

137
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,440
If you have no photo of you and him

138
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,840
when you go back next year,

139
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,440
your schoolmates will think that you lied to them,

140
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,120
right?

141
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,280
Let's go, it's going to rain soon.

142
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,880
Come on.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
You can't work it out?

144
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,800
No, it's so hard.

145
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,720
Let me see.

146
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
There's a rectangular vegetable field

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,960
which is 6 meters long and 3 meters wide.

148
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
If it is surrounded by a fence,

149
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
what's the length of the fence?

150
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,080
Which is the length, and which is the width of the field?

151
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,920
This is the length, and this is the width.

152
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,480
Exactly.

153
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
What are the length and the width of the field?

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
It is 6 meters long and 3 meters wide.

155
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
So here are two lengths

156
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
and two widths now.

157
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,909
How many meters is it

158
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,570
if these numbers are added up?

159
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,000
18 meters.

160
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,000
Exactly.

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,760
If one side of the field is attached to a wall,

162
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,090
how many meters of the fence is remaining?

163
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,360
I got it.

164
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,000
It is amazing

165
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,530
to see a birthmark at the same part, right?

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,930
With the thunder as loud as it is today,

167
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,480
the neighbors even couldn't hear you

168
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,740
knock hard at the door.

169
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,940
For many years,

170
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,410
I'd dreamed repeatedly that on a thundering day,

171
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,880
I couldn't find

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
the way back home,

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,760
wet all over,

174
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
shivering with cold.

175
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
However, I've never dreamed of this

176
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,460
since I gave birth to Chengzi.

177
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,640
Why did you dream of thundering?

178
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,300
Because I'm afraid of being punished by God.

179
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,370
Superstitious.

180
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
How irritating!

181
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Why don't they leave?

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,000
Enough,

183
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,810
stop twisting the vegetables.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Trim them quickly and let's go home.

185
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,640
Go.

186
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,010
Li Jianjian,

187
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,100
are you having a stomachache?

188
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,440
I have a headache.

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,440
Still worried about your brother's problem?

190
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,840
Don't you always say that

191
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
a kid with a mother

192
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,090
is always better off than one without?

193
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,640
Yes, I do agree with that,

194
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,200
but I still

195
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
feel uneasy.

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
It really was an under-punishment

197
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
for that jerk Chengzi.

198
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,320
And,

199
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
if Ziqiu's mother

200
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,560
brings me a sister too,

201
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,800
I'll have to spend my lifetime

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,530
raising kids for other people.

203
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,240
Do you have to say "lifetime"?

204
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
You are too young now.

205
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,330
Oh, Li Jianjian,

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,570
what does your brother Ziqiu like?

207
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,200
He likes buns

208
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,160
and noodles with sweet-and-sour ribs.

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,840
Well,

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,920
isn't his birthday

211
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
around the corner?

212
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
I must know what his favorite things are,

213
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
so that I can buy him the right gifts.

214
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,040
Oh yes.

215
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,160
Next Friday is his birthday.

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,640
You forgot something like that!

217
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
It's not strange that I forgot it.

218
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,860
But how did it occur to you?

219
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,280
For things as important as birthdays,

220
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,340
I've got to record them in a notebook.

221
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,250
Could you tell me what Ziqiu likes?

222
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
I think Ziqiu will like this headphone.

223
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,080
His favorite color is black.

224
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,380
You made a good choice.

225
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Yeah.

226
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,560
What's the matter?

227
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,420
You're not quite yourself today.

228
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
Don't you have a sister to care about?

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,170
Why do you care about me?

230
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,060
The length.

231
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,960
The width.

232
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,840
The fence.

233
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,160
You're jealous even about this?

234
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm jealous because of you? Come on!

235
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,560
I still have Ziqiu.

236
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,480
I'll pay you my share for

237
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
the cost of the headphone back home.

238
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,760
Birthday boy,

239
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
chat with Aunt He Lan.

240
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,160
I'll handle the kitchen work.

241
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
What are you doing? I'm cooking here.

242
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,580
And you can't cook.

243
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,080
Besides, isn't Li Jianjian chatting

244
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,800
with her?

245
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,520
She's not her niece.

246
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,400
Just go.

247
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,560
Oh please!

248
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,400
Aunt He Lan and I

249
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,480
really don't have much to talk about.

250
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,280
Just go.

251
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,400
She came here to

252
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,860
celebrate your birthday.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,440
Just talk about some casual stuff.

254
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,920
Go.

255
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,760
OK.

256
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,560
Take the fruit slices on the table

257
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,200
to her.

258
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,340
Don't do the cutting work.

259
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,640
You may cut your finger.

260
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,840
Wash the coriander.

261
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,680
OK.

262
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
Miss Li!

263
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,420
Just call me Jianjian.

264
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,160
Jianjian.

265
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,680
OK.

266
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,040
Won't doing this stuff

267
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,240
affect your studies?

268
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,640
No, it won't.

269
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,080
My usual academic performance isn't great anyway.

270
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,740
Aunt He Lan.

271
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,160
Here, Li Jianjian,

272
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,240
fresh apple slices.

273
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,840
Have some.

274
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
Jianjian, go ahead.

275
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,960
Your hands are dirty.

276
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
There're toothpicks here, right?

277
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,240
Look what a mess you've made on the table.

278
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
Clean it up later yourself.

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,920
OK.

280
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
Aunt He Lan, whatever you want to say,

281
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,880
can't you just

282
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
say it there?

283
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,960
Sit down.

284
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,920
OK.

285
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,640
Just now,

286
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,200
why did you

287
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,860
talk to Li Jianjian like that?

288
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,760
What's wrong with the way I talked to her?

289
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,560
I normally

290
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,760
talk to her like that.

291
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
Aunt He Lan,

292
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
are you really treating Li Jianjian

293
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
as some noble lady of the Li family?

294
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
It's wrong for you to talk to her like that

295
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,320
anyway.

296
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,080
They've kept you

297
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,120
warm and fed without asking for your returns

298
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,040
and even paid your tuition fees.

299
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,640
How big a deal was it to clean up the table

300
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,320
for her?

301
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,960
How many times have I told you this?

302
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,220
You must help them as much as you can here.

303
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
I know you don't like to

304
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,680
hear this.

305
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,600
You can't compare yourself to Ling Xiao.

306
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,160
His dad covers his living expenses.

307
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,020
So, it's not the same case for her.

308
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,320
So,

309
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
you need to be a good boy here.

310
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,500
Why hasn't your dad come home yet?

311
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
I guess

312
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,720
he forgot to get the cake.

313
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Maybe he already reached the building,

314
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
but then he went back out to get it.

315
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
I'll call him now.

316
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
OK, he's back.

317
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,440
What took you so long?

318
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,240
Dad.

319
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,440
Well, when I reached this building,

320
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,760
I found that I forgot to get the cake.

321
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,420
Well, what did I just tell you?

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,520
OK.

323
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,880
Um, tell Jianjian dinner is ready.

324
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,480
OK.

325
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,480
Do you know how hard it is for Liubao to

326
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,800
work outside?

327
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,840
The great conditions you have now

328
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,360
are not for granted.

329
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,440
They're not obliged to

330
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,840
cover your tuition fees.

331
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
So, Ziqiu,

332
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,080
you need to cherish this

333
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
and be grateful.

334
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,560
Ziqiu,

335
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,180
help me get the dishes out.

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,840
Quickly.

337
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,040
Just go.

338
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,760
OK.

339
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm coming.

340
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,440
Ziqiu, happy birthday.

341
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,040
Happy birthday.

342
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,920
Thank you all very much!

343
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,760
You're 18 now. You're 18 now.

344
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,400
You're 18 now.

345
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,530
You're an adult now.

346
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,800
Eat some dishes.

347
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,280
Let's eat.

348
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,040
I want this.

349
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,240
He Lan.

350
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,560
Yes?

351
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,520
Just make yourself at home.

352
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,920
We're not good at manners.

353
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,480
So, just eat whatever you want.

354
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,010
Exactly.

355
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,640
This pork stewed in soy sauce Haichao made

356
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,400
is really amazing.

357
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,080
It's one of his best.

358
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,480
Have some.

359
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
I'll manage it myself.

360
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,600
Isn't it just like home

361
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,040
in here?

362
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,800
Tasty.

363
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,240
Haichao,

364
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,960
here.

365
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Thanks. I'll manage it myself.

366
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,040
Let me help you.

367
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,369
You must let me help you.

368
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,200
Haichao,

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,260
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

370
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,960
Today is

371
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,069
Ziqiu's birthday.

372
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,680
Allow me to nag a little more.

373
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,760
To be honest,

374
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,800
without Haichao...

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,600
There she goes again.

376
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,120
…Ziqiu won't have this condition today.

377
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,280
If he dares to treat you bad,

378
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,210
I'll be the first to break his legs.

379
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,000
Ziqiu,

380
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,120
propose a toast to your dad.

381
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Oh, what are you doing?

382
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,640
Let's just eat.

383
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Get up.

384
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, propose a toast to him.

385
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,080
Dad, I propose a toast to you.

386
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,040
OK, OK.

387
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,640
Don't drink too much. It's too sweet.

388
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,900
Come on. Eat some food.

389
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,520
Oh, boy, you still haven't poured wine

390
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,680
for your dad.

391
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh,

392
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,080
you're about to turn 18,

393
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,540
but you're still so naive.

394
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,600
Well,

395
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,480
but he actually understands it.

396
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
Well, um,

397
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
you have been raising him all these years.

398
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,820
It must have been hard for you.

399
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,200
L-L-Let's just sit down and eat.

400
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,080
Let's just eat.

401
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,280
Ziqiu,

402
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,810
propose a toast to Mr. Ling?

403
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,600
Just sit down. Let's skip my part.

404
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,160
Let's skip my part.

405
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,720
Mr. Ling,

406
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,640
where's the birthday gift you bought

407
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,320
for Ziqiu?

408
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,520
You guys guess what it is.

409
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,040
Lucky money.

410
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,770
Lucky money.

411
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,680
Lucky money! Lucky money! Lucky money!

412
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,340
That's so boring! Boring!

413
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,720
How did you know it was going to be

414
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,600
lucky money?

415
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,560
Because you have only lucky money

416
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,400
in your mind.

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,520
Oh,

418
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
my daughter still knows me the best.

419
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,840
Lucky money.

420
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,000
There you go.

421
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,520
Ziqiu,

422
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,440
happy birthday.

423
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,800
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

424
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,400
Let me see.

425
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
Let me see how much you put in it.

426
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,600
Why do you take my lucky money away?

427
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
You put so much inside.

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,720
On my last birthday,

429
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
you gave me only 600 yuan.

430
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,880
The sum just goes up this year.

431
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,210
You'll have a bigger sum

432
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
for your next birthday too.

433
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,720
Really?

434
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,850
Of course it's real.

435
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,480
Come on.

436
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
-Yes. -Yes. -Yes.

437
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,780
Ziqiu, happy birthday to you.

438
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,560
Happy birthday.

439
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
Thanks ,thanks.

440
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,360
Happy birthday!

441
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,290
Happy birthday!

442
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,530
Happy birthday!

443
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh, these dishes

444
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,600
are so nicely made.

445
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,640
Well, you should stop drinking,

446
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,040
Ling Heping!

447
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,560
Yeah.

448
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,200
Don't go to the police station in the afternoon.

449
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,840
Stay

450
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,960
and drink with me.

451
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,040
I've applied for a leave.

452
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,840
I've applied for a leave.

453
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,920
I'll drink with you.

454
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,050
I'll drink with you.

455
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,720
I've cooked for you for so many years, just to get this!

456
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,600
Stop drinking.

457
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,400
You bad friend.

458
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
Remove the wine cup from your dad.

459
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,560
Hurry!

460
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,940
Oh, come on!

461
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,720
Are you two

462
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
my sons?

463
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,160
Dad, did you just drink into oblivion?

464
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
You can't even recognize your sons!

465
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
You are my son.

466
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
We have no blood ties.

467
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,450
We don't have the same surname.

468
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,520
But we still are one family.

469
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
And you are my son too.

470
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,720
Yes.

471
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,880
They all are your own kids.

472
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
Ling Heping,

473
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm having a hard time in my heart.

474
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,520
Do you know that?

475
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,400
I'm having a hard time.

476
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,530
What's the problem?

477
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,360
I've been feeling like fate has been

478
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,280
very nice to me.

479
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,720
It gave me such good kids.

480
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,480
I cherish them so much.

481
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,280
Since they were so small, I've been raising them. Now they've grown up so much.

482
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,800
I treasure them.

483
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
I hate to beat them.

484
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,360
And I hate to yell at them.

485
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,720
But some people just won't stop reminding me that

486
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm not their real dad,

487
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,840
not their father,

488
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,040
or their family.

489
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,080
Where is their family then?

490
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,170
His grandma with blood ties

491
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,580
always beat him and yelled at him.

492
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,240
And, Ling Xiao,

493
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,440
he couldn't even sleep

494
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,160
when he saw his real mother,

495
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,320
and became sleep deprived.

496
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
He then suffered from insomnia night after night.

497
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,280
It hurt my heart when I saw this.

498
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,610
Who can take care of this for me?

499
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,960
Who even know this?

500
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,760
Do you?

501
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,080
My son, my son Ziqiu,

502
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
has suffered even more.

503
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
Everybody can yell at him.

504
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,920
They all keep saying,

505
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,560
"You must be a good boy.

506
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,400
You must... you must learn to show respect."

507
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,920
When has he ever

508
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,040
treated me bad?

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,560
In...

510
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,490
the middle of the night,

511
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,680
he kept washing clothes in the bathroom

512
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,600
♫Darling♫

513
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,280
and helped me clean the floor and cook.

514
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,800
When has he ever treated me bad?

515
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
♫Sometimes♫

516
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
But right in my sight, you still beat him

517
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,480

518
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,880
and kicked him.

519
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,760
All these eventually landed on my heart.

520
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,840
Do you know that?

521
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,800
What are you doing?

522
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,080
What are you doing?

523
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,160
♫And I would♫

524

Hurry!

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,330
You get a glass of water.

531
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,900
D-Don't let him fall on his knees.

532
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,320
Come on.

533
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,360
♫This is what growing up is like♫

534
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,500

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,610
Mr. Ling.

540
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,920
I'm going to work now.

541
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,520
That's right.

542
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
Let him lie down facing a side like this.

543
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
♫Maybe you are trying hard♫

544
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,560
Get a garbage can ready.

545
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,760
When he throws up,

546
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,280
♫to forget that♫

547
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
don't let him get choked.

548
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,000
If anything goes wrong,

549
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,080
call me immediately.

550
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,920
♫just as I am♫

551
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,040
Things have driven my dad sick.

552
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,280
All that matters is you don't get the same sickness.

553
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,600
Why would I?

554
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,090
Don't you hate Chengzi?

555
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
I hate her?

556
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
I hate your grandma-in-law's family,

557
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,250
the female part of three generations,

558
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,720
all of them.

559
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,890
You're becoming a hamster.

560
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,320
Don't be mad.

561
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,000
They'll be gone after the New Year.

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,560
Humph.

563
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,840
Hurry up, people.

564
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,280
Why are you so slow?

565
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
You slow down.

566
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,840
Oh, look at your head covered in sweat.

567
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,280
Where in the world is

568
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,000
Ziqiu's grandma-in-law's house?

569
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,560
Almost there. Almost there.

570
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,020
Jianjian, let me tell you.

571
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
Today we are here to

572
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
visit Ziqiu.

573
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,880
And we'll go home after the visit.

574
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,940
Don't mess around.

575
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,180
We're not going home with him?

576
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,560
His mother isn't getting married with Uncle Li,

577
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,120
so he's not your brother now.

578
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,800
We certainly can't go home with him.

579
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
But Dad has already bought him a bed.

580
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You've bought a bed for him already!

581
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,520
He Ziqiu.

582
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,680
Ziqiu.

583
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,600
He Ziqiu.

584
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,800
Why did you come here?

585
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,090
I thought I said that

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
I was going to stay in my grandma-in-law's house for several days

587
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
and would bring back some sticky corn cobs for you.

588
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,600
Why didn't you wait for me?

589
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,440
Ziqiu.

590
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,320
Dad.

591
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,240
Hey.

592
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,120
So,

593
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,260
you're going to...

594
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
I'll carry it for you.

595
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,120
Come on.

596
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,850
Look at this.

597
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,760
All rural kids

598
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,800
go to work

599
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,640
in the field.

600
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,280
Who would leave their kids idle?

601
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,800
What about

602
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,720
Ziqiu's school?

603
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,760
Who knows?

604
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,200
Just let him attend some free classes.

605
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,730
I don't have money for that.

606
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,970
If He Mei owes you money,

607
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,240
go ask her for it.

608
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,840
Ma'am,

609
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,320
we really aren't here to

610
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,560
ask for money.

611
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,520
We just want to see Ziqiu.

612
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,960
You're quite a sensible man.

613
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,440
Why did He Mei

614
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,080
go to Shenzhen to work?

615
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
It was her decision.

616
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Anyway,

617
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,680
she went there alone.

618
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,360
Back then,

619
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,560
she insisted on

620
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,490
marrying that jerk Zhao Huaguang.

621
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
I disagreed,

622
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
but she wouldn't give up.

623
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,840
Now that she got married,

624
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,720
she could've just lived a normal life.

625
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,960
You get along with whoever you marry.

626
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
If it turns out to be a bad decision,

627
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,280
then blame fate.

628
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,880
Am I right?

629
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,290
How unexpected that

630
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
after a period

631
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
as short as one year,

632
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,160
she came back and said she got divorced.

633
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,620
And she was even pregnant.

634
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,000
I told her to have an abortion, but she wouldn't.

635
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,280
She said she would raise the child herself.

636
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,010
I went to talk to Zhao Huaguang,

637
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,480
but that jerk said that

638
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,760
he didn't want the child

639
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
and that she should have an abortion immediately.

640
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,360
Mom,

641
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,640
why do you talk about this again?

642
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,440
Why shouldn't I talk about this?

643
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,520
Leave Ziqiu to me.

644
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,240
I'll bring him to the city

645
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,690
and support his schooling.

646
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,540
I'll raise him.

647
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,480
Ziqiu, have some meat.

648
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,520
Don't you love

649
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,780
sweet-and-sour ribs?

650
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,440
Dad,

651
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
I don't like meat.

652
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,240
I just like vegetables.

653
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,920
No!

654
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,120
You must eat meat in order to grow tall.

655
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,720
Trust me.

656
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,300
Thank you, Dad.

657
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,520
Have some.

658
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,000
Ziqiu,

659
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,690
has your mother sent the money?

660
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,840
Ziqiu,

661
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,440
you've got to impress them.

662
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,200
If you don't behave,

663
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,730
your dad will send you away.

664
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,560
Why did you scare him?

665
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I was teasing him.

666
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,560
Please, don't tease a kid

667
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,400
like that.

668
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,060
He's just a kid, so it doesn't matter.

669
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
But a kid would take it to his heart.

670
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,600
Ziqiu,

671
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,720
don't cry. It's OK.

672
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,160
It's OK, kid.

673
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,760
She was wrong.

674
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,240
I won't send you away.

675
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,080
I won't.

676
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, come on.

677
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,520
I was just teasing you.

678
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,180
You really took it seriously?

679
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,480
A boy shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

680
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,880
Just eat please.

681
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,320
If you still don't eat, the noodles will get soggy.

682
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,120
So funny!

683
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,520
Stop it.

684
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,600
Can't you see Haichao is upset?

685
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,580
Why so serious?

686
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,920
Trust me.

687
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,960
I won't send you away.

688
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,440
You're not going anywhere.

689
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,840
You'll just be around me.

690
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
Just like Jianjian,

691
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,560
you're my child.

692
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,380
How can a father send his son away?

693
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,680
Trust me.

694
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
I won't send you away.

695
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,520
My mother said that

696
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,480
you took my kid to your family

697
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,360
and allow him to study worry-free.

698
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,480
I can only say

699
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,840
thank you.

700
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,560
Thank you for giving Ziqiu a father.

701
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,240
You're Ziqiu's lucky star.

702
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Right now,

703
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,280
I'm having some difficulties.

704
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,480
I really can't deliver you the money

705
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,160
to cover his living expenses.

706
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,360
Please treat Ziqiu

707
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,240
as your own son.

708
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
Don't worry.

709
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,640
Since you are the one who raises him,

710
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,040
he'll be your son.

711
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,360
He'll treat you

712
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,080
as his real father,

713
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,560
because he's a good kid

714
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,280
who cares about bonds.

715
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,080
What a pity that

716
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,360
I have

717
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,960
only this short period of mother-son relationship with him!

718
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,200
I have no luck to

719
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
continue being his mother.

720
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,940
But in this distant place,

721
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll love him and bless him

722
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,600
in my heart,

723
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,760
forever.

724
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,400
I will manage to

725
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,800
repay you

726
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,440
the money I owe you one day.

727
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,600
Sorry.

728
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,080
Today,

729
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,240
I said something I shouldn't have

730
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,560
and upset your father.

731
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,760
It's OK.

732
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,770
He won't take it seriously.

733
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,570
I do know that I've been bothering you,

734
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,280
but

735
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,560
we...

736
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,690
It's for my own good.

737
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,840
I know.

738
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,080
It's still my fault for being incompetent.

739
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,880
There you go again.

740
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
OK, OK, OK.

741
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
I won't talk about it.

742
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Ziqiu.

743
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,040
Yes?

744
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,240
Promise me one thing.

745
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,240
What is it?

746
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,840
Forget your mother.

747
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,920
Stop asking around about her

748
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,360
and stop looking for her.

749
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,020
She has left for so many years.

750
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,720
Don't always cling to the things of your childhood.

751
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
This will be good for both of you.

752
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
I don't mean anything substantial.

753
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,120
I just want to know why.

754
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,160
Ziqiu,

755
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,130
you should keep your good conscience.

756
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,090
Your dad has been so kind to you.

757
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,120
Don't hurt his feelings.

758
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,720
I know.

759
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,530
Good boy.

760
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,880
Happy birthday.

761
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,160
Thank you.

762
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,560
You can open it.

763
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,600
OK.

764
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,480
A watch.

765
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,600
Thank you.

766
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,040
You have a good taste.

767
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,600
Let me help you put it on.

768
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Thanks, but no need.

769
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
I can't wear a watch while playing basketball.

770
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,850
I'll put it here.

771
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,840
See you later.

772
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,890
Give me the ball.

773
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
Keep doing your homework.

774
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,340
Don't go slack.

775
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,760
Stop knocking.

776
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,480
Oh goodness.

777
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
What are you doing here

778
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
on such a weekend day?

779
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,730
Where's my brother?

780
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,920
He's not here.

781
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,080
He's not at home or the restaurant.

782
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,560
If he's not here, where can he be?

783
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,320
How do I know?

784
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,760
Call his cell phone.

785
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,600
I tried.

786
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,260
He left his cell phone at home.

787
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,400
Then I don't know all the more.

788
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,230
He should be back

789
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,040
very soon.

790
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,360
You can sit there

791
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,690
and wait for him. Don't get in the doorway.

792
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,800
What is it for?

793
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,199
Take me to my brother.

794
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,840
Why must I do that?

795
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,710
If you don't,

796
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,520
I won't leave.

797
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,120
Then stay here.

798
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,909
Take me to my brother.

799
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,480
Let go!

800
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,840
Let go!

801
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,280
If you don't let go, I'll use violence.

802
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,120
I'll count from one to three.

803
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,560
One...

804
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,760
I'll pay you 100 yuan.

805
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,560
It's 100 yuan.

806
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,040
You're just taking circles.

807
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,500
Is my brother really here?

808
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,890
I don't know either.

809
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
It's just a guess.

810
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,120
You'd better find him for me.

811
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,640
When are you people going to leave?

812
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
It's none of your business.

813
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,560
It's certainly my business.

814
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,400
After you annoying people leave,

815
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,460
my brother will be mine exclusively.

816
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,320
My grandma said that

817
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
he's my brother.

818
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,800
He has no ties with you.

819
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,450
You two are just neighbors.

820
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,520
I don't care what you people say.

821
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,120
I'm with him all the time

822
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
anyway.

823
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,200
Humph.

824
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,760
Humph.

825
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,080
Oh yes, I remember.

826
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,360
He should be doing grocery shopping in the supermarket.

827
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,890
Let's go.

828
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,760
Follow up. Hurry.

829
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,960
You are fooling me.

830
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,250
Then don't come with me.

831
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,290
Where is she?

832
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,440
Hey.

833
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,060
It's OK. It'll be fine.

834
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,600
Don't worry.

835
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm here.

836
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
Who is Qin Meiyang's family member?

837
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,240
I am. I'm her brother.

838
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,200
Look.

839
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,840
She has a fracture in her forearm

840
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,960
and some slight bruises on the head,

841
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,420
but these aren't serious.

842
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,160
Now, go inside

843
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,600
with me

844
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,520
and go through the admission procedure.

845
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,080
OK.

846
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,640
How did she fall over?

847
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,610
I don't know either.

848
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,480
It's OK.

849
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,720
She's still so young,

850
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,640
and you took her to run around.

851
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,520
If anything serious had happened,

852
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,480
who would take the responsibilities?

853
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,360
I will.

854
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,960
I'll cover the medical costs.

855
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,680
Is it just about the medical costs?

856
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,200
Well,

857
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm also so curious.

858
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,160
How did she fall over?

859
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,240
Explain to me.

860
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,400
I don't know.

861
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,520
You were with her,

862
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,080
and you're telling me you don't know?

863
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,600
You think I can believe that?

864
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,360
I'll ask you again.

865
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,560
How did she fall over?

866
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Chengzi is awake.

867
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,000
How was it?

868
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,170
It's OK, Dad.

869
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,560
Go and take care of the restaurant.

870
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,240
I'm here.

871
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,240
Is Chengzi really OK?

872
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,780
She's OK. Don't worry.

873
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
Don't worry about my mother.

874
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,920
Hey,

875
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,400
um…

876
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,920
My brother!

877
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,240
I want him.

878
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,680
My brother!

879
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,320
I want him.

880
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,020
You can go home.

881
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,520
OK. Then let's go home.

882
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,200
I'll cook

883
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,580
and tell Ziqiu to bring some food for you.

884
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,160
OK.

885
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,880
Go ahead.

886
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,960
Let's go.

887
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,890
We're not welcome here.

888
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,960
I remember you used to

889
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,680
like her very much.

890
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
When you were so young back then,

891
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,500
you already took care of your sister.

892
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,780
And she liked to be around you.

893
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,680
Whoever asked her,

894
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,920
she always answered she liked you best.

895
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,480
Probably because I always talked about you with her,

896
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,360
Chengzi liked you

897
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,440
when she saw you

898
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,440
for the first time.

899
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Maybe to her,

900
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,160
besides her parents,

901
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,650
you're the closest family member.

902
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,280
So, when she saw you

903
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,610
being so nice to Li Jianjian, she would...

904
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,200
certainly feel jealous.

905
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,040
So,

906
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,780
after all, she's your sister.

907
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,560
Can you

908
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,520
share your affection for Li Jianjian,

909
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
even just a little bit,

910
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,720
with her?

911
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,000
Please?

912
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,520
I won't share

913
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,440
what belongs to Li Jianjian with other people.

914
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm not you.

915
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,640
I finished my shower, Li Jianjian.

916
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,370
You go ahead.

917
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,120
OK.

918
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,360
I'll go later.

919
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,220
It's almost 11:00.

920
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,010
Just have a shower and go to bed.

921
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,200
Dad doesn't want you to eat candy.

922
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,330
While he's not here,

923
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,580
eat it quickly.

924
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,080
Oh, you ignore me!

925
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,880
Just open your mouth.

926
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Ah, ah, ah!

927
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,920
Good girl.

928
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,240
So?

929
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,400
You're still

930
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,880
thinking about that silly girl?

931
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,000
You didn't push her.

932
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,080
She fell over herself.

933
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
Why should you be upset?

934
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,940
Isn't it silly?

935
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
I'm not silly.

936
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I know it wasn't my fault.

937
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,760
Then why are you so upset?

938
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,290
It was not you who fell over.

939
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,770
She's still a kid after all.

940
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,220
And she had a fracture.

941
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,280
These days,

942
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,520
Ling Xiao has been frequenting the hospital

943
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,880
as soon as school was over

944
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,140
and even stayed there.

945
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
I haven't seen him for days.

946
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,040
He must be so upset.
