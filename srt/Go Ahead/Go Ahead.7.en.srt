1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,979
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,900
Episode 7

4
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,320
When we're at home,

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,190
Mingyue always tells me about you guys.

6
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,080
And I wanted to

7
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
invite you to dinner long ago,

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,000
but I've always been busy

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
with my work.

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,440
Thank you.

11
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,600
You're welcome.

12
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,000
Mom, please order.

13
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,079
You're a regular customer here,

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,720
so you order.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
What should I order?

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,320
Whatever you want to eat.

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Ling Xiao,

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,160
you do so well in exams

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
and you've attended the IELTS test,

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
so do you plan to study abroad?

21
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,760
No.

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,960
The teacher recommended me

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,600
to try it.

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,560
So did you

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,760
get a recommendation for admission to college?

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes,

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,600
but that's not my ideal school.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,079
Anyway, I'll take the college entrance examination,

29
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,640
so it's the same.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,480
You're right.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,200
Your grades

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,120
can get you into any college

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
that you want.

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,840
You, your brother and your sister

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
are really brilliant.

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
I heard from Mingyue

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,320
that Li Jianjian's wood carving

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
won a prize!

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,920
Yes.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,200
So wonderful!

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
Who taught you that?

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,240
I learned it on the online forums

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,800
and post bars.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,040
There're some really

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
amazing masters

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
and they upload

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,360
some teaching videos,

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
so I learned it on the internet.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,200
You did?

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,560
Then what made you think of

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
taking part in a competition?

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,160
I didn't!

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,480
I just carved

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,280
a little piece of work

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
and gave it to Xiao.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,000
He took it

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
to the competition.

58
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Oh, I see.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
Jianjian doesn't

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,680
do so well in exams,

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,880
but she has a great artistic talent.

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
If she gets some awards,

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
it'll be easier for her to get admitted to college.

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
We've agreed

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
to go to college in Beijing.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
The admission lines for art students are lower,

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
so it won't be a problem.

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,560
Well,

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
what about you, He Ziqiu?

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Which college would you like to go?

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,800
Well,

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
Renmin University of China

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,040
or Jiao Tong University.

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
I think Jiao Tong University is great.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Then after you graduate,

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,120
you can go and direct traffic.

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,120
A college graduate of Jiao Tong University goes to direct traffic?

79
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,080
That's putting fine timber to petty use!

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

81
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,480
Mingyue wants to be a lawyer,

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,680
so she'll apply for China University of Political Science and Law.

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
When you're in college,

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
you'll be far away from home

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,960
and you can take care of each other.

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,400
May I have your order?

87
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,640
Yes.

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
Spicy boiled pork slices,

89
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,840
beef short ribs,

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
fried eggplant with red pepper,

91
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,960
any recommendations?

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,160
Oh, well...

93
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,080
You order these three dishes

94
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,120
every time.

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
We're having this meal together.

96
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,480
You should have asked if there are any types of food

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,280
that they really don't like.

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,159
No, there're not.

99
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,240
We eat anything.

100
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Remove spicy boiled pork slices.

101
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,760
Is your fish fresh today?

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,280
Yes, the fish arrived this morning.

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
Then we'll have spicy boiled fish.

104
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
A whole fish,

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
keep the fish head.

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,440
OK.

107
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,360
How is your shrimp

108
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,120
today?

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,080
You can go

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,320
and pick it in the fish tank.

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,760
The seafood just arrived this morning.

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,560
OK.

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,600
Then take me to see it.

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,960
You have a talk

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
and I'll go to order.

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,000
OK.

117
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
That's my mom.

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
She's a little demanding.

119
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,760
Why didn't I know

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,920
that you wanted to be a lawyer?

121
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,080
I didn't know it, either.

122
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,600
My mom wants me to be a lawyer.

123
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,800
Fortunately, our father doesn't interfere.

124
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

125
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Can't you shut up

126
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
and just enjoy the food?

127
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
But the food is not here yet!

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,680
So I can't shut up.

129
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
When we were eating,

130
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,360
why did you keep

131
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,520
looking at He Ziqiu?

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,760
I didn't!

133
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
He just sat opposite me.

134
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
Couldn't I look up?

135
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,159
I was just asking.

136
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,360
What's the attitude for?

137
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,560
You look at yourself in the mirror a lot recently.

138
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
Don't pay too much attention to your appearance.

139
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,440
If you're the first place in your grade

140
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,040
like Ling Xiao is,

141
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
you'll shine even in the dark.

142
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
Ling Xiao doesn't shine.

143
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,360
How dare you talk back to me?

144
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
I can see what's in your mind.

145
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
And what's this?

146
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
A bowknot hairpin.

147
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,160
OK, go over there.

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Come back home early tonight

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,200
and be careful.

150
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,880
Bye, Mom.

151
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,640
Look at those kids!

152
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,080
OK, it's time.

153
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,800
Take it out.

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,040
The fever has gone down.

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,040
You know what,

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
after you get better,

157
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
you have to extract that tooth.

158
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,760
You're having the fever over and over

159
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
and it's bad.

160
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,160
Can I take a day off tomorrow?

161
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,600
We'll talk about it tomorrow morning.

162
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm having a fever

163
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,000
and it hurts so much!

164
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,280
Let the storm

165
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,560
be more violent!

166
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,560
He Ziqiu.

167
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,440
Your dad gave you this.

168
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,120
My dad?

169
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,720
Yes.

170
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
Thanks.

171
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,150
He Ziqiu,

172
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,720
I've copied the notes and would you...

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,120
He Ziqiu!

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,520
Ziqiu,

175
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,640
someone just brought some food

176
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,560
and he said he was your dad.

177
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
He Ziqiu,

178
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,040
we didn't know until today

179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
that your dad was not your real dad.

180
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
You lucky brat!

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
Your real dad looks very rich.

182
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,760
When you get back together with your real dad,

183
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,840
you have to invite us to dinner.

184
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,400
Where is he?

185
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,640
He just left.

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,600
Ziqiu, what are you doing?

187
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,080
Can't you think

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
before you talk?

189
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,320
Excuse me,

190
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,720
what is He Ziqiu going to do?

191
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
He's going after his real dad.

192
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,720
His real dad?

193
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Zhao Huaguang!

194
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,480
Ziqiu!

195
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,560
Ziqiu!

196
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,160
Let go of me!

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,680
Ziqiu!

198
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Don't ever show up in front of me!

199
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
I won't go with you!

200
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,800
I have nothing

201
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,360
to do with you!

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
Don't go too far!

203
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
Ziqiu, let's go.

204
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't go too far!

205
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,200
How would I have

206
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
such a stupid son?

207
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,160
Haven't you told your dad

208
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
that your real dad came to see you?

209
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,600
Are you out of your mind?

210
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,640
Why are you angry with me?

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,680
I take you as my friend,

212
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,280
but you just laugh at me like everyone else.

213
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
When did I laugh at you?

214
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,480
OK, I'm wrong.

215
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm wrong. OK?

216
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,360
Please don't

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
mention it ever again!

218
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
Then what?

219
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,960
What if he comes to see your dad?

220
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,280
On what grounds could he come to see my dad?

221
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,720
OK.

222
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,520
According to your logic,

223
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,600
on what grounds could he come to see you?

224
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,120
If everyone is reasonable,

225
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,360
there will be no bad person.

226
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,080
He can't persuade you,

227
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
so he might come to your home.

228
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,640
I think you should tell your dad,

229
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,120
so he won't

230
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
be caught off guard.

231
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,360
We'll see.

232
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,960
Let's not talk about him.

233
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,240
Don't cry. Don't cry.

234
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,760
There, there.

235
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
Don't cry.

236
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
There, there. Don't cry.

237
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,080
It's fine.

238
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,160
There, there. Don't cry.

239
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,720
Jianjian, relax.

240
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,400
Jianjian.

241
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,320
Relax.

242
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
I need to go to the bathroom.

243
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920
Li Jianjian!

244
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
You went to the bathroom five minutes ago.

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,360
It's fine.

246
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,960
It won't hurt after taking anesthetics.

247
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,200
Relax.

248
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,520
Li Jianjian!

249
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,280
Which one of you is Jianjian?

250
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,200
Here.

251
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,520
Please come this way.

252
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,520
Jianjian! Jianjian!

253
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,160
Look at me.

254
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,920
Take a deep breath.

255
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,680
Yes, take a deep breath.

256
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Better?

257
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
It's fine. I won't leave you alone.

258
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
I'll be here with you.

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,240
Let's go.

260
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,560
Come.

261
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
It's fine.

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
It won't hurt at all after taking anesthetics.

263
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,080
Really.

264
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,200
You're lying.

265
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,040
Li Jianjian.

266
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,920
Jianjian.

267
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,800
Jianjian.

268
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,880
What are you thinking about?

269
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080

Don't be so nervous.

275
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,080

so are you feeling better?

297
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960

Why are you so quiet?

303
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,800

♫I see myself with big wings♫

305

If only you can be a dentist in the future.

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,720
You won't be afraid of it

307
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,760
if I'm a dentist?

308
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,320
No.

309
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,640
I was really scared.

310
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,840
That doctor hit me with a hammer.

311
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Stop asking me about it.

312
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,680
I don't want to recall it.

313
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,720
The class notes on this Friday,

314
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,520
and I've also brought you

315
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,960
the textbook.

316
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,320
This is the homework for this weekend.

317
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,480
I've suffered so much.

318
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,120
So can't you

319
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,080
stop torturing me?

320
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,240
No.

321
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,560
As your monitor

322
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,800
and your best friend,

323
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
I have to

324
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
supervise your study.

325
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,080
No need for that!

326
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,600
It hurts!

327
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,320
Why haven't you gone

328
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,000
to your tutoring class?

329
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I skipped it.

330
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,000
If your mom finds out about it,

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,680
you'll be in big troubles!

332
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,840
No, she won't.

333
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,480
My grandma is sick

334
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
and she's been in the hospital these days,

335
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
so she has no time to watch over me.

336
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,720
Where is He Ziqiu?

337
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,280
He's helping in the restaurant.

338
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,680
I'll leave you alone.

339
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,520
Well,

340
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,680
is He Ziqiu

341
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,200
alright?

342
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Yes. What's wrong?

343
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,200
He was mad

344
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,520
when his real dad came to see him.

345
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,040
His real dad?

346
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,040
He has no real dad!

347
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,120
What are you talking about?

348
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,720
Don't you know about it?

349
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
Make it clear.

350
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm not quite sure about it.

351
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,000
At noon yesterday,

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,560
I wanted to give him the notes

353
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,960
and I saw him

354
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,840
rush out angrily.

355
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,640
His basketball teammates said

356
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,960
that his real dad came to see him

357
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,920
and brought them a lot of food.

358
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm having a toothache!

359
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,520
Didn't he

360
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,320
tell you about it?

361
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Ziqiu!

362
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,360
What's up? Is it your tooth?

363
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,880
Let me see.

364
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,880
Qi Mingyue is here.

365
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,720
Did Zhao Huaguang go to see you?

366
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
He came here?

367
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Where is he?

368
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,560
Didn't he go to school to see you?

369
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,560
How did you know that?

370
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,080
Qi Mingyue saw it.

371
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,960
Why are you staring at her? What's going on?

372
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,160
I don't want to see him!

373
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,280
How many times has he gone to see you?

374
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,480
Just a few times.

375
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,560
Why didn't you tell us?

376
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,720
I've told you

377
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,440
that I don't want to talk about it

378
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
and I don't want to see him!

379
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,920
There's nothing to talk about!

380
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,200
That's it!

381
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,040
Don't stand here

382
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,760
like two pillars!

383
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,280
I have to get the food prepared.

384
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,920
He Ziqiu,

385
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
don't change the subject!

386
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,760
What does he want with you?

387
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,200
He wants me to go with him,

388
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,120
but I refused!

389
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
Why are you so meddlesome?

390
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,760
I'm sorry.

391
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,520
I thought...

392
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,160
What did you

393
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,080
think?

394
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
If I don't talk about it,

395
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,160
it means that

396
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
I don't want anyone to know about it.

397
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,800
Are you really that bored?

398
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,040
If you're bored,

399
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,720
you should ask your mom

400
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,800
to get more tutoring classes for you!

401
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,680
Why are you angry with her?

402
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,080
I'm sorry.

403
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,920
Mingyue!

404
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,080
Mingyue!

405
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
Well...

406
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,720
What's going on?

407
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,360
Don't take what Ziqiu said to heart.

408
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I'll beat him for you!

409
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,320
Didn't you say

410
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,240
that you would have a meal here?

411
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Don't go!

412
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,040
Mingyue!

413
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,560
You go rest and leave her to me.

414
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,109
Bring her back.

415
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,160
Qi Mingyue!

416
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,069
Wait!

417
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,960
Ziqiu didn't mean to hurt you,

418
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,720
so don't take it to heart.

419
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
No.

420
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,080
It was my fault.

421
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,960
You were just concerned about him.

422
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm in no position to do that.

423
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,160
We're not friends after all.

424
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
You don't take him as a friend?

425
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,080
No.

426
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
He's my good friend's brother.

427
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,400
He's like

428
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,320
a stray cat on the street

429
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
that eats the food on your hand,

430
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
but doesn't let you hold it in your arms.

431
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,960
And when it's upset, it might bite you.

432
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,120
Sometimes he provokes you.

433
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,280
And when you're still mad,

434
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,560
he has totally been over it.

435
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Just like what my dad said about him,

436
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,760
he's insensitive.

437
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
No, I'm insensitive.

438
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,440
He Ziqiu was right.

439
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
If Jianjian had known about it,

440
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,720
she would have told me.

441
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,080
It was all my fault.

442
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,000
It was obviously

443
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Ziqiu's fault.

444
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
But why do you always

445
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,280
put the blame on yourself?

446
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Because I did something wrong.

447
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,080
When we know

448
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,960
our friends are upset,

449
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,440
we'll ask about it.

450
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
And there's nothing

451
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
wrong about it.

452
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,400
Really?

453
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,440
But He Ziqiu

454
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,920
is really angry.

455
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,640
When someone is angry,

456
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
you think it's your fault.

457
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,400
Qi Mingyue,

458
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,880
there's really something wrong with you.

459
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,480
I can't do anything right.

460
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,680
I always make mistakes.

461
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I want to give you a suggestion.

462
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,720
If you feel that you've done something wrong

463
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,640
the next time,

464
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
or your mother thinks that you've done something wrong,

465
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,000
before you take the blame,

466
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,320
think about

467
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,240
if someone else

468
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
does it,

469
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,120
if it's still wrong.

470
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,680
You're really great.

471
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,440
You're pretty with great personality

472
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,800
and responsibility.

473
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,920
Your parents don't have to worry about you.

474
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,400
The only problem

475
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,320
that you should work on

476
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,800
is that you're not confident enough.

477
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,800
You have to learn to judge things by yourself

478
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,040
and don't deny yourself

479
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,080
just for what others say

480
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,600
about you.

481
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,480
What's wrong?

482
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,280
Xiao!

483
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,320
Where is Mingyue?

484
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,840
I let her go home.

485
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
Did she leave with tears on her face?

486
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,240
No, she left with a smile on her face.

487
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,400
What's going on?

488
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,920
Zhao Huaguang wants him back!

489
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,160
In his dreams!

490
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,480
Why didn't you tell us about it?

491
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,280
I've told you so many times

492
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,040
there's nothing to say about it.

493
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,280
Dad is really busy every day

494
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
and why bother him with it?

495
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,720
Well...

496
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,240
Should we tell him or not?

497
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,680
Never mind.

498
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,800
Since he thinks

499
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
it's his own business,

500
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
he can do

501
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,440
whatever he wants.

502
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm having a toothache!

503
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,160
Go back to your bed

504
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
or you might have a fever again.

505
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,920
What's wrong with you three?

506
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,120
Nothing.

507
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,200
Nothing.

508
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,240
Dad,

509
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
the minced meat and tofu you cooked

510
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,760
is so delicious.

511
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,200
Li Jianjian, come.

512
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,600
Come.

513
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
Xiao, I want some minced meat and tofu.

514
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,480
Yes.

515
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,200
It's great.

516
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,320
Dad, have some.

517
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
Xiao, have some meat.

518
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
You have some more.

519
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't want it now.

520
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
Have some meat.

521
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,920
Thank you, Dad.

522
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,200
Just let

523
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,440
them be.

524
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,640
It won't be for long.

525
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,720
By then, Ling Xiao and Ziqiu

526
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
will go to college in Beijing

527
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,720
and we'll have only Jianjian.

528
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,080
That'll be much easier.

529
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,800
Jianjian

530
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,960
is the most troublesome among them.

531
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,800
After she gets into college,

532
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,400
life will be really much easier.

533
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,680
You're just saying that.

534
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,560
You'll miss her so much.

535
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,040
Haichao,

536
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,240
your phone!

537
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm occupied now.

538
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,240
Who's calling?

539
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,040
A stranger.

540
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Pick it up for me.

541
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,320
OK.

542
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Hello?

543
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,360
Your noodles.

544
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,720
This is not Li Haichao.

545
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,520
Who is that?

546
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,160
He's coming.

547
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,280
Who is that?

548
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,400
I don't know him.

549
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,280
He said he was Zhao Huaguang!

550
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,880
Who is Zhao Huaguang?

551
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,120
Which room does Ziqiu live in?

552
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,240
The one in front of you.

553
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,320
This is so small.

554
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,960
It used to be a utility room.

555
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,120
When Ziqiu moved in,

556
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,080
I put a bed in it.

557
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
How can he live here?

558
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,400
Don't get inside.

559
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,800
I'll just look around and I won't touch his things.

560
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,480
Please sit and have some water.

561
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,320
Sit down, please.

562
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,280
You came home early today.

563
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,640
Didn't you go to arrest someone today?

564
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
We've got a guest here.

565
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,200
Let me introduce.

566
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,040
This is Ziqiu's godfather,

567
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,080
and he's a police man.

568
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,760
Zhao Huaguang?

569
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes, I am.

570
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,840
I'm Ling Heping and I live upstairs.

571
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,120
You're his godfather?

572
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,920
Yes.

573
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,480
Sit down, please.

574
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,400
Sit down, please.

575
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,680
I picked up

576
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,520
your phone call

577
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,920
and we didn't know

578
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
who you were at the moment.

579
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
Has Ziqiu

580
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,120
told you about me?

581
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,560
When Ziqiu's grandma was alive,

582
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,760
she talked about you a lot,

583
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,800
and then his auntie

584
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,040
occasionally mentioned you,

585
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,080
but it was nothing nice,

586
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:22,920
so

587
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,360
we did...

588
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,400
What's his name again?

589
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,160
Zhao Huaguang.

590
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Zhao Huaguang.

591
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,760
We did know your name.

592
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,160
Here is the thing.

593
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,440
I want to talk

594
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,080
with Ziqiu's foster father

595
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,400
about something related to Ziqiu.

596
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,800
As a neighbor,

597
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,240
would you like to give us some privacy? will you?

598
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
He's not just a neighbor.

599
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,920
He's Ziqiu's godfather.

600
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,640
We are a family.

601
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,840
Just say whatever you want.

602
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,800
I don't think it's appropriate.

603
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,360
I think he should

604
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,000
give us some privacy.

605
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,000
Here is the thing.

606
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,160
I've talked

607
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,920
with Ziqiu a couple of times.

608
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,720
And he must have told you about it.

609
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,640
How could you do

610
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
such an inconsiderate thing?

611
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,960
Have you got our permission?

612
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,840
How dare you talk to him without our permission?

613
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,160
Actually,

614
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,480
I should have

615
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
discussed it

616
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,680
with Ziqiu's foster father.

617
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
What do you mean by that?

618
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,760
You must get our permission before doing that!

619
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,600
But

620
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,760
he has grown up.

621
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
I want to see him

622
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,920
and hear what he thinks.

623
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Yes.

624
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,160
You're right.

625
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
In our family,

626
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,680
we respect the kids' thoughts.

627
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,840
So just tell us

628
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,680
what you want.

629
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
First of all, I'll

630
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
introduce my situation.

631
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,280
I've been

632
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,040
living abroad,

633
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,680
doing some export business.

634
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,360
And you must have known it,

635
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,240
yes,

636
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm rich.

637
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,480
But my wife and I

638
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,080
have no kids

639
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,520
these years.

640
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,960
When she found out

641
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
that I had a child with my ex,

642
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
she said

643
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,960
that it didn't make sense

644
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,200
if we didn't take care of this child

645
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,760
when we were in

646
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,640
such a good condition.

647
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,840
It doesn't make sense?

648
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,040
Tell me what doesn't make sense.

649
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,520
I've investigated

650
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,120
about Ziqiu's situation.

651
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,440
You're not married

652
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
with He Mei, are you?

653
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,360
And Ziqiu's family register

654
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,200
is still with his grandma,

655
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,520
which means

656
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,320
you have

657
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,240
nothing to do

658
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,560
with Ziqiu legally.

659
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,680
But since you've

660
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,440
brought Ziqiu up,

661
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,960
you're really a good man.

662
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,680
Deep down my heart,

663
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
I'm really grateful.

664
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,360
Stop it.

665
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,080
I know what you're doing now.

666
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,440
You want

667
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,280
to take Ziqiu back.

668
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
You know He Mei well, right?

669
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,440
She left you

670
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,840
because you were poor.

671
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,800
She did that to me too.

672
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,920
She divorced me

673
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,800
because I was poor.

674
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,080
I didn't abandon

675
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,440
Ziqiu back then.

676
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,920
But at that time,

677
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,000
I really couldn't take care of him.

678
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,360
Now my condition is much better,

679
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,600
so I want to make it up to him.

680
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

681
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,040
You abandoned him when you were poor

682
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
and now when you're rich,

683
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,480
you want to take Ziqiu back.

684
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,040
Do you think

685
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,280
the kid grows up

686
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,240
like some grass

687
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,360
in the field?

688
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,400
Right?

689
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,920
I didn't mean that.

690
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,840
Then what did you mean?

691
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,560
Mr. Li,

692
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,000
you're a sensible man.

693
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,680
If you're really kind to Ziqiu,

694
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,640
you should let him go with me,

695
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,720
which is good for everyone,

696
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,480
right?

697
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
It cost you

698
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
just 200,000 to 30,000 yuan

699
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
to raise Ziqiu these years, right?

700
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,480
How about this?

701
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,760
I'll give you one million yuan as compensation,

702
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,680
so what do you say?

703
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,920
How much?

704
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,360
One million yuan!

705
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,160
I've never

706
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,960
seen

707
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
so much money in my whole life!

708
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,320
Me, neither!

709
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,000
One million yuan,

710
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,600
it should be such a pile of money.

711
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,800
Who knows? I think it's more than that.

712
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,360
I can't make so much money

713
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,520
in my whole life!

714
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
How many bowls of noodles do I have to sell to make so much money?

715
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,400
Just a piece of cake!

716
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,360
You losers!

717
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,080
How dare you!

718
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
You losers!

719
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,880
Ziqiu,

720
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,920
you're back.

721
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640
What are you doing here?

722
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,440
Scram!

723
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,200
How dare you do this

724
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,520
to your father over and over again?

725
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,600
How many times do I have to tell you

726
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
that you're not my father?

727
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,400
Why did you come here

728
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,440
to bother my dad?

729
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,760
You don't take after me

730
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,920
at all!

731
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,160
What can you achieve

732
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,200
living such a crappy life

733
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
in such a crappy family?

734
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
For your own good,

735
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,840
you should go with me

736
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,880
to study abroad!

737
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,640
Ziqiu!

738
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,720
You're in no position

739
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
to say that!

740
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,200
What do you think you are?

741
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,080
Calm down! Calm down!

742
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,240
No need to argue with such a stranger!

743
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,080
You!

744
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
You're the one who's living a crappy life!

745
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,100
You!

746
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,160
He Ziqiu,

747
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,840
think about it harder!

748
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
Who's being really kind to you?

749
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,000
He called us a crappy family

750
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,720
and he said

751
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,480
that we couldn't achieve anything.

752
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,840
Jianjian,

753
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,520
just ignore

754
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,160
what he said.

755
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,520
You didn't see

756
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
how awesome your dad was just now.

757
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
I thought your dad

758
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,760
would be bullied,

759
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,360
so I came home

760
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,320
to back him up

761
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,560
as a police man.

762
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,560
But in the end,

763
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,920
he just pushed

764
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,080
that man out

765
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,400
with both hands.

766
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,280
You say, isn't that awesome?

767
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,640
Dad, you're so awesome!

768
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
Let's just eat.

769
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,120
Get the soup here.

770
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,480
OK. OK.

771
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,640
Why didn't you tell me

772
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,040
that Zhao Huaguang went to see you?

773
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,440
You did something wrong, you know?

774
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,920
I was wrong, Dad.

775
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm sorry.

776
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,080
Both of you

777
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,640
know it, right?

778
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,720
We found it out several days ago,

779
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,520
but he didn't let us tell you.

780
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,840
I've told him

781
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,880
that I wouldn't go with him.

782
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,560
I've thrown back the clothes and shoes

783
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,120
he bought for me.

784
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Does it work?

785
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,640
You're about to take

786
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,080
the college entrance exams!

787
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,200
You have only one month left!

788
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,200
You say, what if

789
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,360
he affects your mood

790
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,000
and you fail in the exams?

791
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
What you've done will be in vain.

792
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,600
Do you think it's worthy?

793
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,240
Do you want to do it all over again?

794
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
You've grown up,

795
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,520
but you're not adults yet.

796
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,480
You're not old enough

797
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,760
to deal with things like this.

798
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,240
It's not humiliating

799
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,640
to turn to your parents.

800
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,840
I don't want to bother you

801
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,800
with it.

802
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
It's bothering to raise children!

803
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,760
And you kids have bothered me

804
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,080
a lot!

805
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,960
What do we do now?

806
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,360
It's no big deal.

807
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
Don't go with him if you don't want to!

808
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,240
He won't win

809
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,640
even if

810
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,760
we go to court.

811
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,600
Yeah.

812
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,560
If he comes to see you again,

813
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,800
call the police

814
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,120
and I'll deal with him.

815
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,920
Yes.

816
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,320
We can go to court.

817
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,000
Yes!

818
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,480
I'll get a good lawyer.

819
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,560
We're not short of money!

820
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,280
There is a senior lawyer

821
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,360
that always

822
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,560
comes to

823
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,000
our noodle restaurant

824
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,840
and I'll hire him.

825
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,920
That's settled.

826
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,360
Good! See?

827
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,680
It's solved.

828
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,800
How is it solved?

829
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,520
Didn't you hear it?

830
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,320
We can go to court.

831
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,640
How could they

832
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,840
be so shameless?

833
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,800
A senior executive's wife just left

834
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,080
and then a new rich came!

835
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
They just came uninvited.

836
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,200
Do they think it's a buffet restaurant here?

837
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,320
Jianjian, where did you get it from?

838
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,080
You sound like an adult.

839
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,520
Li Jianjian,

840
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,320
don't read

841
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,360
so many internet novels online.

842
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,240
And get ready for your competition!

843
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,840
Do you hear me?

844
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,400
OK.

845
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,600
A competition?

846
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,160
What competition?

847
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,120
In the holiday,

848
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,680
there's some

849
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,800
Green Day Cup,

850
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,960
and it's

851
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,200
a carving improvisation competition.

852
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,520
A improvisation competition?

853
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
If you can't think of anything

854
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,280
on the scene,

855
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,040
wouldn't that be embarrassing?

856
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,960
Then I'll come back empty-handed.

857
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,840
She does have a big heart!

858
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,680
She has a goose head.

859
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,080
You have a goose head!

860
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,000
It's so great.

861
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,880
Dad.

862
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,710
Yes.

863
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,230
You're still doing homework?

864
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,800
Yes.

865
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,710
Thank you, Dad.

866
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,520
Ziqiu.

867
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,040
Yes?

868
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,640
I know

869
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,960
you always feel

870
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,240
that you owe this family,

871
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,200
so you try your best

872
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,720
to make it up for us.

873
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,440
You help me with the housework,

874
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
including the laundry,

875
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,680
the cleaning

876
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,200
and helping me in the noodle restaurant.

877
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
And you've always

878
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,680
been kind

879
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,160
to Jianjian and even Ling Xiao.

880
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,200
Dad,

881
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
don't say that.

882
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,080
I'm willing to do those things.

883
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,120
You know,

884
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,000
when Jianjian's mother passed away,

885
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,000
she was still

886
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,920
pregnant with

887
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,680
a baby boy.

888
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,320
But Jianjian kept saying,

889
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,520
"Mom,

890
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,120
give me an elder brother!

891
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,640
I want an elder brother!

892
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,960
I don't want a younger brother!"

893
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,880
And then you came.

894
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,280
I really think

895
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,840
that god

896
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,360
is on my side

897
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,200
and it's amazing.

898
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,840
Jianjian could finally have an elder brother.

899
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,520
And I can be father to another child.

900
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
So

901
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,480
things in this world

902
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
are uncertain.

903
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,560
Good things

904
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,800
might happen to you

905
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,400
and bad things might happen to you too.

906
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,800
Sometimes, a bad thing

907
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,840
can turn into a good thing.

908
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,880
Misfortune may be an actual blessing.

909
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,480
Yes.

910
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,560
That's what I meant.

911
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,760
So

912
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Ziqiu,

913
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,640
no matter what happens,

914
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,760
don't worry.

915
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,840
I'll always be here for you.

916
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,560
♫Thinking of the first time that I held your hand,♫

917
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
OK.

918
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,200
Don't worry.

919

♫you held me so tight as if I was everything to you♫

920

I'll be here for you.

921
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,720
OK.

922
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,280
As long as you can be healthy

923
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,080
♫One is getting bigger,♫

924

♫while the other is getting smaller♫

926
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,120

♫Time brings us♫

♫together in our lives♫

930
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,720
I'll be old.

Dad, don't worry.

932
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,320
♫Good night♫

933

♫Goodbye♫

♫your way home will get longer and longer♫

940

Then I'll be relieved.

941
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
Now do homework.

942
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,680
Finish your homework.

943
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,280
♫Walk slowly♫

944
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,560
Go to bed after having the milk.

945

OK.

946
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Dad, good night.

947
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,800

Thank you.

953
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,920
Our fruit tea, please hurry up.

954
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,360
OK.

955
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,360
Miss Tang,

956
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
thank you for the food

957
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,120
and the drink.

958
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
You're welcome.

959
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,960
I've made some money,

960
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,040
so it's on me of course

961
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
Isn't it great to be an actress?

962
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,440
You can meet so many entertainers.

963
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,560
Miss Tang,

964
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
have you met Zhou Xun?

965
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,720
Not yet.

966
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,840
But we're in the same circle,

967
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,400
so we have a chance to work together.

968
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,920
Miss Tang,

969
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,000
do you want to apply for

970
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
a film academy?

971
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
What do we have to prepare

972
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,720
for applying a film academy?

973
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,440
Do you want to apply for a film academy

974
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,400
and become an actress too?

975
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
Do you think I can?

976
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
It depends on

977
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,320
whether you have an acting talent.

978
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,200
Would you like

979
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,360
to try shedding tears within one minute?

980
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,720
Within one minute?

981
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,720
Sure. Can't you even do that?

982
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,600
Miss Tang, please teach me.

983
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,480
OK.

984
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,680
There're some little tricks.

985
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,160
First, you have

986
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,320
to be emotional,

987
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,360
and then think about

988
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,080
the things that make you really sad.

989
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,560
Miss, is our fruit tea ready?

990
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,200
Right away.

991
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,200
Li Jianjian, what were you laughing at?

992
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,640
I didn't laugh at anything.

993
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,320
Mingyue,

994
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,800
don't you think I should go

995
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
and be a training class teacher?

996
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,160
After all, the last one in our class

997
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,320
can be a teacher too.

998
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,520
What do you mean?

999
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
I don't mean anything.

1000
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,400
I want to learn from Miss Tang.

1001
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,680
Miss Tang,

1002
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,560
just ignore her.

1003
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,000
She's just being jealous.

1004
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,160
Tang Can

1005
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,320
was a child star

1006
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
and she's a very experienced actress.

1007
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
When she's making a commercial,

1008
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,040
those people address her "Miss Tang".

1009
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,000
Even if she doesn't work hard,

1010
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
she has a wealthy family.

1011
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,320
Her father works in logistics business

1012
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,080
and her mother

1013
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,680
worked in one of the top 500 companies in the world.

1014
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,600
What does she do now, dear?

1015
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
She's Miss Tang's

1016
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
full-time agent.

1017
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,120
When Miss Tang

1018
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,160
gets famous all over China,

1019
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
her classmate who's the third from the last

1020
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,440
will still be doing the dishes

1021
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,920
in some small noodle restaurant.

1022
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,160
Doing the dishes?

1023
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,320
Excuse me?

1024
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,440
My dear.

1025
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,160
Here is the thing.

1026
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,800
You might not know

1027
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,560
He Ziqiu,

1028
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,200
but you must have heard of Ling Xiao.

1029
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,720
He always gets the first place in school

1030
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
and his photo is always posted on the bulletin board.

1031
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,160
So what?

1032
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
He's Li Jianjian's elder brother,

1033
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,240
and she has another elder brother

1034
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,400
who also does well in school.

1035
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
In the future, both of them will take good care of her.

1036
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,360
The key point

1037
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,680
is the dishes.

1038
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,200
The key point is that

1039
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
she never does the dishes at home.

1040
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Your fruit tea is ready.

1041
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,680
Coming.

1042
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,080
I'm bound to

1043
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,600
be taken good care of

1044
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,960
in my whole life.

1045
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,160
Let's go

1046
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,480
and give your brothers the fruit tea.

1047
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,080
OK.

1048
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,640
We're the only child

1049
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,600
in our families,

1050
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,320
but why could her family have three children?

1051
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,480
But the family names of her elder brothers are not "Li".

1052
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
Don't always find fault with Tang Can again.

1053
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,600
I just can't stand her

1054
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,440
playing a sweet girl in public.

1055
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
It means she's a good actress.

1056
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,920
Li Jianjian,

1057
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,840
go to your brothers on your own.

1058
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,200
I'm going back to the classroom.

1059
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,320
I haven't finished my homework

1060
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,000
for the cram school.

1061
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,000
Are you still mad at Ziqiu?

1062
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,480
I've told him

1063
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,200
to apologize to you.

1064
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,120
No, I'm not mad at him.

1065
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,280
I really haven't finished my homework

1066
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,720
and my mom will check it.

1067
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm leaving.

1068
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,240
Mingyue...

1069
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,320
You want to be a lawyer in future, right?

1070
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,000
So can I win

1071
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,080
if we go to court?

1072
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,680
What do you think?

1073
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,280
The thing is that my dad and I

1074
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,440
are not on the same family register,

1075
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,000
so legally,

1076
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,240
he's not my father.

1077
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,400
Are you crazy?

1078
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,560
There's no need to go to court!

1079
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,640
You're about to be 18 years old

1080
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,720
and you won't need a guardian by then.

1081
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,880
He didn't bring you up

1082
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
and you don't have to provide for him when he gets old.

1083
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,080
Whether you want to go with him

1084
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,160
is up to you.

1085
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,840
But if it were me, I would go with him.

1086
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
There's no need to take the hard way.

1087
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,200
It's not easy for your dad to run a noodle restaurant.

1088
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,280
Just take it as robbing the rich to help the poor.

1089
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,680
I can make money!

1090
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,840
Why should I take his money?

1091
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,640
Look at you!

1092
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,840
You're being silly.

1093
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,680
Ziqiu,

1094
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,920
this is the fruit tea for you.

1095
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,080
My hands are dirty. Help me with it.

1096
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,080
Is that one for me? Thanks.

1097
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,400
No, it's for my brother!

1098
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,440
I'm leaving. Bye!

1099
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,600
Slower!

1100
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,640
Isn't it nice to have a little sister?

1101
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,520
That's not hygienic!
