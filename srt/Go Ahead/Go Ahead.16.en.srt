00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,910
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Episode 16

4
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,340
Why did you bring him here?

5
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,150
I brough him to have noodles.

6
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,960
You are back.

7
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,600
Good.

8
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Well. Let me introduce him to the two of you.

9
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,750
This is Ran.

10
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,360
Zheng. Zheng.

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,750
Jianjian's friend.

12
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,240
You've known each other for years, right?

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,030
Yes, yes.

14
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,600
Mr. Li, I'm hungry.

15
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,630
Cook a bowl of seafood noodles for me.

16
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,360
There are no seafood toppings.

17
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,750
Let me cook beef noodles

18
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,030
with some fish balls for you, OK?

19
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,960
Dad, I want them too.

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,750
OK. I'll cook two bowls of noodles.

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,750
You guys have fun...have fun

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,950
Ziqiu, sit opposite.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
This place is good.

24
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,000
Sit opposite.

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,420
What are you doing?

26
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
This is my eldest brother.

27
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,060
This is my second brother.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
This is Zheng Shuran, my boyfriend.

29
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,810
So, the three of you grew up together?

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,670
Gosh! Li Jianjian,

31
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,360
I actually see your muses.

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,470
They are different. They are different.

33
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,880
They cannot be compared with

34
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,079
your muses.

35
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,190
My creation is about the surplus heat of life,

36
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,829
not about the enthusiastic expression of life.

37
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,750
They don't conflict.

38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,960
The essence is the same.

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
The more enthusiastic it is,

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
the sadder and drearier the bottom color is.

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm good at discovering

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,110
the fervor on the surface.

43
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,240
And you can see

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,160
the ashes after life is burned at a glance.

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,079
Your works

46
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,880
are expressions of good things on the surface,

47
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,390
but there is always

48
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,270
something fragile as if treading on thin ice.

49
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,630
Right. Beauty is fragile.

50
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,600
Do your works

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,440
give people such a feeling too?

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
What are they talking about?

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,390
But I'm more inclined to

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,520
pursue eternal beauty.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
There is nothing

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,250
that is eternal.

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,080
The ending of all things in the world

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,110
is disappearance.

59
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,600
Disappearance is eternal.

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,760
But disappearance is not beautiful.

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,690
Disappearance is disappearance.

62
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,550
Sorry to disturb.

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,000
It seems that

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
this is not the first time you met.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,480
Right. Actually, this is the second time.

66
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,830
Last time, at the sculpture exhibition,

67
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,350
there was a little misunderstanding between us.

68
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,040
At the time, I heard

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,270
someone called her name.

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,670
She didn't recognize me.

71
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,640
So,

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,350
after meeting Li Jianjian,

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,640
you asked her to be your girlfriend?

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,390
Yes.

75
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,720
She is interesting

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,950
and warm.

77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,760
I like it a lot.

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,350
Thanks.

79
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,200
So what on earth do you like about her?

80
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
I should say

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,790
I haven't found

82
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,270
anything that I don't like about her.

83
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,070
Neither have I.

84
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,270
I think Shuran is perfect.

85
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,760
We have a lot to talk about.

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,270
The noodles taste particularly good, don't they?

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,830
Yes.

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
We're going to have fish.

89
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,390
You arrived just in time.

90
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,000
Mr. Ling.

91
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,000
Jianjian.

92
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,730
Wash hands and eat.

93
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Wash your hands. Come on.

94
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,510
Did you see Zheng get in the car?

95
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes, yes.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,480
I told you

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,760
that it's good to ask him to stay for supper.

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,110
There're so many people at home, so it won't be convenient.

99
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,270
And he won't feel at ease.

100
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,550
I think he is quite at ease.

101
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,880
He ate a large bowl of beef noodles.

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,510
That's not enough.

103
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,600
He asked for a portion of fish balls.

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,530
The fish balls Dad cooks are tasty.

105
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,300
I think he has bad intentions.

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,270
Mr. Ling, decide which side is right.

107
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,880
Her boyfriend

108
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
agreed to meet her

109
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,440
in my shop yesterday.

110
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,270
But

111
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,040
on the way,

112
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
he stared at a girl's hips

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,060
and then went back.

114
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,390
Don't talk nonsense.

115
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,390
Whom did you hear about it from?

116
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,670
She said that.

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,830
Don't talk nonsense. You don't understand.

118
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,830
Inspirations are very important for creating works.

119
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,040
It's true that

120
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,390
we don't understand the art of making sculptures.

121
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,600
But Ziqiu is right.

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,159
When he sees a beautiful girl, he becomes impulsive.

123
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,550
Besides, he is psychologically immature.

124
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,550
He has graduated from university for a few years,

125
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,200
but still depends on

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,390
the living expenses his parents give him.

127
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,600
He has good family conditions.

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,110
He treats you

129
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,920
to an ice cream

130
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
with the money from his parents.

131
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,160
Do you think that's good?

132
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,640
Well. Well. Stop.

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,550
Let's eat.

134
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,070
An artist doesn't need

135
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,000
to make a living?

136
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,160
You have spent

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,230
some money on subsidizing your good friend.

138
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,640
Will you subsidize him too?

139
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,200
That will be a bottomless pit that can never be filled.

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,830
It is not as serious as you said.

141
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,320
Is his current situation

142
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,950
really good?

143
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,920
Well. Stop!

144
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,320
Let's eat.

145
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,790
OK.

146
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,390
Call him and break up with him.

147
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,790
Are you crazy?

148
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,920
I said break up with him.

149
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,200
Why did you talk to your sister like that?

150
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,800
I ask her to break up with him.

151
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,240
I think you should break up with him too.

152
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,390
Why?

153
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,510
Why do you

154
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,230
interfere in

155
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,320
my life?

156
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, Jianjian,

157
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,670
what your two brothers do

158
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,760
is for your own good.

159
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm good.

160
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,270
I'm very good.

161
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,230
When they were away,

162
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,480
I was good too.

163
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,600
I have friends.

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,950
I have things I like to do.

165
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm happy every day.

166
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,230
As soon as you were back,

167
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,480
you had to prove your existence,

168
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,950
didn't you?

169
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,270
You even called the police.

170
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,510
I called you but I couldn't get through.

171
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,440
Moreover, what he said on Weibo

172
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,040
is ambiguous.

173
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,830
You have

174
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,480
greatly affected

175
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,600
my life.

176
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,510
Do you know?

177
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,870
Actually,

178
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,350
I do this for your own good.

179
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,040
Thanks. I really don't need.

180
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,159
You can

181
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,040
just live

182
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,170
your own lives well.

183
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,790
When I have a toothache, I'll see the dentist myself.

184
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,250
All the dentists are good.

185
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,600
When I want to have desserts,

186
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
I'll go and buy them in the street.

187
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,480
There are dessert shops everywhere.

188
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,270
The two of you really

189
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,730
don't need to do that to me.

190
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,290
You are not my own brothers.

191
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
Actually, there is no

192
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
legal assistance relationship between us.

193
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
You don't need to

194
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
do anything to me.

195
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
Understand?

196
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
Jianjian, why did you say that?

197
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,450
Since the day you met us again,

198
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
you've been holding it back, right?

199
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,600
Finally, you said that.

200
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
I didn't want to say that so bluntly.

201
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,230
You forced me.

202
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,470
Ling Xiao, don't take it to heart.

203
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,549
Dad, Mr. Li, you eat.

204
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm going back.

205
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,320
Ling Xiao...

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,110
Ling Xiao!

207
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,280
Jianjian, what you said

208
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,470
is really hurtful.

209
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,590
You said they are not

210
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,650
your own brothers.

211
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,550
Do you forget

212
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,280
that you've grown up together

213
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
since childhood?

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,910
Buy one for me.

215
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,840
Your tooth doesn't hurt now?

216
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,150
No. Buy one for me.

217
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,590
No. Go home.

218
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,350
Why don't you buy one for me?

219
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,550
Go home.

220
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,760
This is good. This is with jujube paste.

221
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,520
And this is with honey.

222
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Ling Xiao, buy one for me.

223
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,200
Please.

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,320
Just one.

225
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,910
Buy one for me.

226
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,550
Go home!

227
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,910
Will you go or not?

228
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,030
I'll go if you buy one for me.

229
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
Will you go or not?

230
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,550
I won't go.

231
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,150
I'll count from one to three.

232
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,680
If you don't go, I'll leave.

233
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,110
One.

234
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,080
Two.

235
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
Three.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,640
Jianjian! Jianjian!

237
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,550
Sir,

238
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,150
did you see

239
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,080
the little girl who was with me

240
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,910
just now?

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,760
Jianjian!

242
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,110
Jianjian! Jianjian!

243
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,470
Jianjian! Jianjian!

244
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,280
Let go of me!

245
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,880
Jianjian! Jianjian, where are you?

246
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,790
I'm here!

247
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,790
I'm here!

248
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,470
Jianjian!

249
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,760
Jianjian! What are you doing?

250
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,710
Let go of me! Ling Xiao!

251
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,640
Let go!

252
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,880
Let go of my sister!

253
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,470
Let go of me! Let go!

254
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,080
Let go!

255
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,230
Let go of her!

256
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,200
Somebody! Catch the bad guys!

257
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,790
Somebody!

258
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,670
Catch the bad guys!

259
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,440
Don't beat my brother!

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,470
Somebody! Catch the bad guys!

261
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
Let go!

262
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,670
What are the two of you doing?

263
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,710
Let of the kid!

264
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,440
What's going on? What's going?

265
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,880
Call the police!

266
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,780
Luckily, you are fine.

267
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,000
If anything

268
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,440
happened to you,

269
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,840
how would I live?

270
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,080
Haichao,

271
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,440
you should thank

272
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,840
Ling Xiao and Heping for helping you today.

273
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
My son was brave.

274
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,960
Good boy. Awesome! Awesome!

275
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,200
Thank you. Thank you.

276
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,000
Helping, thank you. Thank you.

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,280
Haichao, no need to do that.

278
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,670
This is what I should do.

279
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,320
Jianjian.

280
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,230
Here's what I want to do.

281
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,230
Mrs. Qian, be a witness for us today.

282
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,030
Jianjian,

283
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,690
don't call him Mr. Ling again.

284
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,910
He is your godfather now.

285
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,370
Kowtow to your godfather.

286
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,400
Godfather.

287
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,320
Don't. Don't.

288
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,790
Jianjian. Jianjian.

289
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,110
From today on,

290
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,790
you are like my own daughter.

291
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Good.

292
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,710
Ling Xiao

293
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,440
saved your life today

294
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
and our family.

295
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,550
He'll be your own brother.

296
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,350
Understand?

297
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,590
Call him brother.

298
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,230
Brother.

299
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,030
Sister.

300
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,110
Brother.

301
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,230
Sister.

302
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,280
Brother.

303
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,200
Sister.

304
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Well. Well.

305
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,640
Get up. Get up. Get up.

306
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,230
Get up.

307
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,400
Haichao, Heping,

308
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,960
from today on, you two families

309
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,150
become a family.

310
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,640
Can the marriage

311
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,100
between them be arranged?

312
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Right.

313
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,520
They have kowtowed.

314
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,760
Right.

315
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
This is really good.

316
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,440
Why are you following me?

317
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,550
Sorry.

318
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,640
You are not sorry to me.

319
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,400
You don't need to say sorry to me.

320
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
No, I'm really sorry.

321
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,790
I don't know

322
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
you dislike us so much.

323
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,810
It's not that I dislike you.

324
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,310
It's just that I actually

325
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,280
live very well now.

326
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,030
After you graduated from

327
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,710
high school

328
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,960
and left with your family,

329
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,790
there was no shadow

330
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,150
left for me.

331
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,200
No.

332
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,640
It's true that because you didn't come back on time,

333
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,230
I was a little angry.

334
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,230
But I understand you.

335
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,550
You don't owe me.

336
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,550
So, you don't need to make up.

337
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,350
What you are doing now

338
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,880
makes me bear a heavy psychological burden.

339
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,210
That's not right at all.

340
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,550
We owe you.

341
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,550
Ziqiu, it's all over.

342
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you want to turn me

343
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,720
into the girl who always followed you when we were little?

344
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,550
Even if you are always with me,

345
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm in my 20s,

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
so I can't

347
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,170
be clingy to my brothers every day, right?

348
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,470
Well,

349
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,150
what do you mean?

350
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,760
You...

351
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,840
You don't need us now?

352
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,280
Didn't I make it clear to you?

353
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,640
No. You can be angry.

354
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,150
You can even ignore me.

355
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,760
But

356
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,930
don't say you don't need me.

357
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,350
That's none of my business!

358
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,910
Go back to your own home.

359
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,960
It's the first time I saw Jianjian

360
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,440
was so angry with her two brothers.

361
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,760
You missed once.

362
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,280
Back then, when Ziqiu and Ling Xiao were going to leave,

363
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,880
Jianjian lost her temper.

364
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,790
She went to her grandma's

365
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,030
and was unwilling to come back to see them off.

366
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,440
Ziqiu and Ling Xiao called her,

367
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
but she refused to answer the phone.

368
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
She had been angry for several months.

369
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,550
But they have long

370
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,760
become reconciled, haven't they?

371
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,350
Look.

372
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,790
How her two brothers care about her after they were back.

373
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,650
But it's Ling Xiao's fault today.

374
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,640
He was too outspoken.

375
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,150
But he is really worried that

376
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,350
Jianjian will be cheated by that boy.

377
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,230
Jianjian is not a little girl now.

378
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,110
They haven't seen each other for so many years.

379
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,000
When he is back,

380
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,840
he still disciplines her as if she were a kid.

381
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,760
Jianjian certainly feels bad.

382
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,440
You are right.

383
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,470
What should we do?

384
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,470
What do you mean?

385
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,760
You won't do anything?

386
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
What can I do?

387
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,230
They've grown up

388
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,470
and their own ideas.

389
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,790
They should resolve the internal conflicts

390
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,550
by themselves.

391
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,030
The more you meddle, the more you'll be disliked.

392
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,590
Jianjian is such a big girl now.

393
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,320
It's the first time she has a boyfriend.

394
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,030
You won't care about such a big thing?

395
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,430
I think you take things easy.

396
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,400
You are right.

397
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
How about you do something about it?

398
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,470
You are going

399
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,710
to use hyacinth beans

400
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,470
to make braised noodles with hyacinth beans tomorrow, right?

401
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,130
That's none of your business.

402
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,280
Do your job.

403
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,109
No, I...

404
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,000
Do your job.

405
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,830
He says he often moves.

406
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,350
He moves from one place to another

407
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,230
and doesn't know where

408
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,470
his real home is.

409
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,560
If he can be as free

410
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,430
as fish,

411
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,610
he won't need to worry.

412
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,210
The fireworks out of the window are so lively,

413
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,520
but it is cold and lonely in the house.

414
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's go.

415
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,560
Let's leave the city.

416
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,470
♫If a heavy rain falls♫

417
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,950
♫Then let me become a sea♫

418
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,800
♫Put on the light you gave♫

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,070
Who is that?

420
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
He Ziqiu?

421
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm here to cook breakfast.

422
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
It is too early.

423
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
It is still seven o'clock.

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,920
I just got up.

425
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,880
Li Jianjian will get up at eight o'clock at earliest.

426
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,520
It is OK.

427
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,190
I'll finish early

428
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,920
and go to the shop to make cakes?

429
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,740
You are so generous that you even bought strawberries.

430
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,430
You can just eat one.

431
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,090
I bought them for Li Jianjian.

432
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,350
What?

433
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,190
You didn't

434
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,310
tell my secret to Ling Xiao, did you?

435
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,470
You want me to tell your feelings for him for free?

436
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,160
No way.

437
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,760
Good. Good.

438
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,830
I want to keep a dubious relationship with him

439
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,680
for a period.

440
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,470
You are having a dubious relationship with him?

441
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,230
Lower your voice.

442
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,520
Don't let out my secret.

443
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,110
I'm cooking.

444
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,590
You are flirting in the early morning?

445
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,690
I won't disturb you.

446
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,230
You got up.

447
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,160
We have bread to eat today.

448
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,620
A big breakfast, isn't it?

449
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,110
My belly aches.

450
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
You guys eat.

451
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,840
I've got to go.

452
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,710
It took you so much time to make the breakfast.

453
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,910
Eat before you leave.

454
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,560
No.

455
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,160
I've told He Ziqiu.

456
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,070
They made too much fuss.

457
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,270
Internet romance has been popular for many years.

458
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,640
Ling Xiao and Ziqiu cannot be blamed.

459
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,590
Zheng Shuran is indeed

460
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,400
somewhat weird.

461
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,070
The two of you suddenly

462
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,040
decided to meet.

463
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,310
And you were out of touch.

464
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,520
I was so worried.

465
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,680
I remember, when we were high school students,

466
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,950
Ling Xiao disciplined her very strictly.

467
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,150
Now you developed an internet romance.

468
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,800
No wonder he is worried.

469
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,590
By the way, Li Jianjian,

470
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,520
why did you take him

471
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,560
to see your dad

472
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,470
when it's the first time you met him?

473
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,710
I didn't mean to take him to see my dad.

474
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,520
He knew my dad

475
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
is running a noodles restaurant,

476
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,710
and wanted to taste the noodles my dad makes.

477
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,280
That was to meet your dad.

478
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,190
Your said he

479
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,830
agreed to meet you,

480
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,640
but because an inspiration came to him on the way,

481
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
so, he went back?

482
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,350
Is there any problem with

483
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,520
your EQs?

484
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,110
Li Jianjian,

485
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,560
you've met each other after developing the internet romance.

486
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,760
How do you feel?

487
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,260
I feel particularly good.

488
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,710
I'm telling you.

489
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,310
We have a lot to talk about.

490
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,280
When you met him,

491
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,190
did your heart flutter?

492
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,800
When you took him to meet your dad, were you nervous?

493
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,710
Didn't you worry that your dad

494
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,710
doesn't like him?

495
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,520
Look. Look.

496
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,520
She is still thinking about it.

497
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,070
I know you surely

498
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,230
don't like him.

499
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,560
If she likes him,

500
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,040
how could she take him to see her dad

501
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,310
when it's the first time they met?

502
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,160
If she likes him, she should have been

503
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,350
extremely nervous.

504
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,590
You are crazy. You learned to develop an internet romance from others.

505
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,310
She can't tell

506
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,430
the differences

507
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,400
between friendship

508
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,590
and love.

509
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,760
I knew she had difficulty

510
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,280
in understanding affections.

511
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,310
In her eyes,

512
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,710
there's nothing but wood.

513
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,710
It's impossible for her to tell them apart.

514
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,280
Yes.

515
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
When you're in love,

516
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,520
you can't be so calm.

517
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,560
You should be

518
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,710
thinking about

519
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,430
that person all the time.

520
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Yeah!

521
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,590
Love is supposed

522
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,710
to be burning hot

523
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,400
and passionate.

524
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,070
What nonsense

525
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
are you talking about?

526
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,590
Love doesn't have to be burning hot and passionate.

527
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,520
What's wrong with steady love?

528
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,560
My parents

529
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,160
met on a blind date.

530
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,680
When they first met, they felt

531
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,520
good about each other

532
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,950
and then decided to get married.

533
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,010
They had a pretty good life together.

534
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,590
Anyway,

535
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,920
we'd like to

536
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,120
develop our love gradually.

537
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,430
I'm in a bad creative state recently.

538
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,110
It's said that love

539
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,160
can inspire creation.

540
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,830
So you start a relationship

541
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,190
for your creation?

542
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
It might bring me some inspiration.

543
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,000
After they moved into the opposite apartment,

544
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,930
our doorbell never stops ringing.

545
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I'll get it.

546
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,630
Good morning.

547
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,430
Morning, Mingyue.

548
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,280
Mom!

549
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,000
What are you waiting for? Give a hand.

550
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,590
It's so heavy.

551
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,560
Mom, why did you come here at such an early morning?

552
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,590
You should have told me.

553
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,950
What if I'm not at home?

554
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,520
It's not 8:00 yet.

555
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,980
You couldn't have got out.

556
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,640
Surprise raid!

557
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,680
My bedroom is a bit messy.

558
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,560
It was so hard to find a place to park the car last time,

559
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,220
so I took a taxi here this time.

560
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,280
You're all here!

561
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,950
Hello!

562
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,800
Mrs. Qi.

563
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
Hello.

564
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,620
You're having breakfast.

565
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,230
It looks not bad.

566
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,310
Pretty healthy.

567
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,520
Mom, have you had breakfast?

568
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,470
Yes, I have.

569
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,350
Enjoy yourselves.

570
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,920
Eat, please.

571
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's eat.

572
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,520
I bought some imported fruits

573
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,310
for you.

574
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,170
Remember to eat fruits every day.

575
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,760
Last night,

576
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,830
I sauced a large piece of beef tendon.

577
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,430
Doesn't it smell delicious?

578
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,280
I've prepared the sauce

579
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,910
and I'll put it in the fridge.

580
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,950
And this,

581
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,160
the barbecue sauce made by your grandma.

582
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,640
Mom, no!

583
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,350
Tang Can is allergic to that.

584
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,680
So we can't have it here.

585
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,470
No one

586
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,190
is allergic to barbecue sauce.

587
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,350
Tang Can, you must be allergic to something else

588
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,590
that you've had.

589
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,000
Yes.

590
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And this,

591
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,190
fish balls

592
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,310
and I'll put them in your fridge.

593
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,400
I'll put these

594
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,950
two reusable bags

595
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,880
in a closet,

596
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,470
so you can reuse them later to protect the environment,

597
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,160
OK?

598
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,350
OK, Mrs. Qi.

599
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,640
Mom, let me help you.

600
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,350
No need.

601
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,680
Just eat your breakfast

602
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,370
and I'll take care of it.

603
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,590
Mrs. Qi is amazing.

604
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,040
Just as usual.

605
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,310
Girls, hang in there.

606
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,000
We have to

607
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,350
withstand the passionate love

608
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,470
from Mrs. Qi.

609
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,760
Sorry. Sorry.

610
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,190
What are you talking about?

611
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,430
Thank you, Mrs. Qi.

612
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,040
You're welcome.

613
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,110
If you like it,

614
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,830
I will come more often

615
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,760
to bring you something delicious.

616
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,920
Good.

617
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,000
Let's eat.

618
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,070
You should clean

619
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,870
the floor completely bit by bit.

620
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
I should come more often.

621
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,410
Are you losing your hairs?

622
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,520
Don't always stay up late even if you want to work hard.

623
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,470
Otherwise, you'll go bald.

624
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,950
You do have a lot of clothes.

625
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,800
Only that part of you

626
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
makes you a girl.

627
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,640
But you've grown up.

628
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,440
Why do you still wear pink dress?

629
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,680
Can't you read some fashion magazines

630
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,920
when you have time?

631
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,040
Mom, it was you who bought me

632
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,640
a lot of pink clothes before.

633
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,560
When did I

634
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,800
do that?

635
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,350
When I took you to buy clothes,

636
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,520
you picked

637
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,650
those pink clothes.

638
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,430
Mom,

639
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,680
can't you stop denying me?

640
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,470
I was showing my concern,

641
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,070
and you don't appreciate it.

642
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,400
Mrs. Qi, I can do it myself.

643
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,280
I can do it myself.

644
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,470
No need.

645
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,520
You don't have to be so polite to me.

646
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,350
You lost your mother when you were little

647
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,880
and nobody took care of you.

648
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,000
Mingyue and you are best friends,

649
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,950
so I kind of

650
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,920
take you as my own daughter.

651
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm not that pathetic.

652
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,190
My father has been taking good care of me

653
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,050
the whole time.

654
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,950
You poor girl!

655
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,470
You've never enjoyed motherly love

656
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,920
and you don't know that motherly love

657
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,780
is different from fatherly love.

658
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,110
It's OK. I'm here.

659
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
OK. Just go out.

660
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,760
Leave it to me.

661
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,470
Well, Tang Can,

662
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
you should clean this room

663
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,110
on your own.

664
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,190
I really can't do it

665
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,400
for you.

666
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,710
Mrs. Qi, you don't need

667
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,190
to clean this room.

668
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,040
My room looks messy,

669
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,070
but I know where

670
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,310
all my things are.

671
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,680
After you cleaned it last time,

672
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,220
I couldn't find my things.

673
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,470
Tang Can,

674
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,160
I'm not being wordy.

675
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,150
But you don't make a lot of money.

676
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,880
So don't spend all your money

677
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,280
on clothes and cosmetics.

678
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,010
The best investment

679
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,830
for a girl

680
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,950
is on study.

681
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,430
Mrs. Qi,

682
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,830
I bought these clothes for my job.

683
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
What kind of job is that?

684
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,160
Going to a parents' meeting

685
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,230
as someone else's parent

686
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,680
is nothing but lying!

687
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,110
You're so pretty

688
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,160
and you were a child star when you were little,

689
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,710
so why don't you continue

690
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,070
to be an actress?

691
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,000
Mom, let me drive you to work.

692
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,800
No need.

693
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,590
Your car is too crappy.

694
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,830
You're not embarrassed to drive it,

695
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,710
but I'll be embarrassed to take it.

696
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,560
Why didn't you tell me

697
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,040
that you wanted a car?

698
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,680
How about selling it?

699
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
And I'll add some money,

700
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
so you can buy a better car.

701
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,530
No need. I think that it's fine.

702
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,040
The car you drive

703
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,300
represents yourself.

704
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,020
When you drive a fancy car,

705
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,020
no one dares to look down upon you.

706
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,280
Mom, I want to discuss something with you.

707
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,880
Say it.

708
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,590
I don't think it's good for me

709
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,920
to be a contract worker.

710
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Here is the thing.

711
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,230
There's a great opportunity

712
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,640
at our station.

713
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,920
In the second half of this year,

714
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,230
two young reporters

715
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,680
will be sent to the Beijing Office,

716
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,280
so I want to go to Beijing...

717
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,110
No! Beijing is too far away.

718
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,470
There're too many people and too many cars.

719
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,310
The air over there is not good, either.

720
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,760
You're totally unfamiliar with it.

721
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,710
I don't want you to go there.

722
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,470
No.

723
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,040
A lot of my classmates are there,

724
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,000
and I'll come back in two years.

725
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,800
Think it through.

726
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
When you come back from Beijing,

727
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,190
you'll be 27 years old.

728
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,560
And it'll take quite a while

729
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,160
to find a suitable boyfriend.

730
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
So when will you get married?

731
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,940
And when will you have a child?

732
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,000
Things like that

733
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,070
will happen when it's time.

734
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,760
So when will it happen?

735
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,180
You have to make a plan.

736
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,610
Tang Can, I'm leaving.

737
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,850
I'm leaving now.

738
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,040
Thank you. I really don't need it!

739
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,280
You just need to

740
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,000
take good care of your lives.

741
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,800
I can go to see a dentist if I have a toothache.

742
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,350
There're a lot of good dentists.

743
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,160
If I want to have some desserts,

744
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,230
I'll go and buy some on the street.

745
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,880
There're a lot of dessert shops on the street.

746
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,760
You two don't have to

747
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,920
do anything for me.

748
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,790
You're not my real brothers!

749
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,950
You're not legally obliged

750
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,280
to take care of me.

751
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,590
And you don't have to

752
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,400
do anything for me,

753
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,040
OK?

754
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Let me have a look.

755
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,920
You have another younger sister?

756
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,470
Give it to me.

757
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,430
Qin Meiyang,

758
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,490
you don't share the same family name.

759
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,280
Hello, this is Ling Heping.

760
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,830
This is Chen Ting.

761
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,430
Chen Ting,

762
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,360
it's been quite a long time.

763
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,640
How are you?

764
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,710
I'm good and everything is good.

765
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,640
Ling Xiao told me

766
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,370
that you were unwell recently.

767
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,870
It's just an old trouble.

768
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,710
I'm fine.

769
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,430
You should pay more attention to your health.

770
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,230
Don't eat cold food.

771
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,560
Stomach bleeding is not a trivial matter.

772
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,640
Thank you.

773
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,920
Is Ling Xiao by your side?

774
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,950
I'm working in the office

775
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,920
and Ling Xiao is in the hospital.

776
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,470
Why did he go to hospital?

777
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,430
Is he sick?

778
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,040
You just won't come back

779
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,900
until the dishes are on the table.

780
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,070
Would you like a bowl

781
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,190
or half a bowl of rice?

782
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,830
No need.

783
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,420
I have no appetite and I don't want to eat.

784
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,920
What happened?

785
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,400
Mr. Li,

786
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,280
I'll get off work if there is nothing else.

787
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,800
OK.

788
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,160
Hang out the sign

789
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,280
of closing.

790
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,830
OK!

791
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,110
Take care!

792
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,190
Now tell me about it.

793
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,800
Today,

794
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,110
Chen Ting called me.

795
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,040
Who?

796
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,170
Ling Xiao's mother.

797
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Are you two still

798
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,520
in touch?

799
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,110
No.

800
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
We didn't get in touch after Ling Xiao went to college

801
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,160
in Singapore.

802
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,880
So

803
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,400
I was surprised

804
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,040
when she called me today.

805
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,430
Yes.

806
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,000
I was surprised too.

807
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,330
So why did she call you?

808
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,230
It seems

809
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,070
that she doesn't know

810
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,160
that Ling Xiao has got a job here.

811
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,350
She thinks

812
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,190
that Ling Xiao just came to visit me,

813
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,000
and today

814
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,190
she called me

815
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,590
to ask Ling Xiao

816
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,640
to go back.

817
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,880
Ling Xiao

818
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,640
doesn't tell me anything

819
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,710
about himself!

820
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,440
How could he?

821
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,000
Don't blame him.

822
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,350
You know what Chen Ting

823
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,430
is like.

824
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,680
I knew it.

825
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I knew Chen Ting

826
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,160
wouldn't have just let Xiao

827
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,640
back so easily.

828
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,760
We made mistakes,

829
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,520
but it's our child who is suffering.

830
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,310
It's too late to say this.

831
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,830
Anyway, I think

832
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,520
you should

833
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,429
talk to Ling Xiao

834
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,469
about it.

835
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,120
What should I say?

836
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,520
He doesn't talk with me a lot.

837
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,870
He talks with you.

838
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,630
How about you have a talk with him?

839
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,120
I can talk with him about other things.

840
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,580
But for this problem, as his real dad, you should talk with him.

841
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,230
How could you say that?

842
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,190
Didn't you say

843
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,000
that you were also

844
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
his real dad?

845
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,150
I really can't help.

846
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,190
Please have a talk with him.

847
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,320
I want to help but I can't.

848
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,850
Please have a talk with him.

849
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,670
It's too salty.

850
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,120
Stop eating it.

851
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,230
What are you doing?

852
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Why didn't you go to bed to sleep?

853
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,489
I wasn't sleeping. I was watching TV.

854
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,469
By the way,

855
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,390
have you talked

856
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,250
to Li Jianjian?

857
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,430
No.

858
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,150
I think you should work

859
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,010
on your temper.

860
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,320
We're her elder brothers,

861
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,950
and we're supposed to be cheeky.

862
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,670
Look at me.

863
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,950
If I hadn't been cheeky when I was little,

864
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,210
I wouldn't have a home.

865
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,670
You know her.

866
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,080
It's quite hard for her

867
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,870
to hold it back for so long.

868
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,210
Don't be mad at her.

869
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,870
After all, it's a fact

870
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,460
that we failed her before.

871
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,850
Why do you wear my clothes?

872
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,190
This is yours?

873
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,390
I thought it was mine.

874
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,930
I have one pretty similar.

875
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,440
Those shoes are also yours?

876
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,520
Do you have foot fungus?

877
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,360
Good.

878
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,020
I was just asking. No offense.

879
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,280
You used to wear mine

880
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,410
when we were little.

881
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,550
You can wear all my shoes,

882
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,250
except the ones

883
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,800
that Li Jianjian sent me back then.

884
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,670
That's my line.

885
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,150
Don't wear that pair of my shoes.

886
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,280
I have barely worn them,

887
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,950
but yours are almost worn out.

888
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,700
Go to bed early.

889
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,870
I'm back.

890
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,090
You bought some fruits again?

891
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,120
Cherries!

892
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,780
Your brother bought them.

893
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,430
Can you believe what this person has done to me?

894
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,600
After attending the parents' meeting,

895
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,150
I took his son out to play.

896
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,660
The game coins cost me a dozen yuan

897
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,230
and I took his son to KFC

898
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,320
which cost me a few dozen yuan.

899
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,710
It's fine if he doesn't want to thank me,

900
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,470
but he gave me a moderate comment!

901
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,520
The reason is that I wasted

902
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,950
his son's time on homework.

903
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,430
How could he do things like this?

904
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,630
He hired you

905
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,800
to attend the parents' meeting,

906
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,520
not to take his son

907
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,390
out to play.

908
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,630
I was being kind.

909
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,230
How could he return my kindness with enmity?

910
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,280
You think you were being kind,

911
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,320
but he thinks

912
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,870
you were making troubles for him.

913
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,400
How could you be so inhuman?

914
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,910
I'm inhuman?

915
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,040
I paid for

916
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,600
half a year's rent

917
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,760
of this apartment!

918
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm inhuman?

919
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
Is she having her period?

920
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,000
You're awake.

921
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,870
This morning,

922
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,000
Ziqiu came at 6:00

923
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,190
and then left.

924
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,230
He was like a wife

925
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,560
in the old society.

926
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,840
What's going on between you two?

927
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,430
Eat quickly.

928
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,190
You're going to the hospital

929
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,120
to extract the dental nerve today.

930
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,470
You can leave home at 10:30.

931
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,950
After seeing the dentist,

932
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,120
I will go to the studio directly

933
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,600
and I'll be there ahead of you.

934
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,080
OK.

935
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,950
The next time you go to see the dentist,

936
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,880
I will go with you

937
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,150
and your brother can clean my teeth.

938
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,120
We'll see.

939
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,120
I've got to go now. Bye.

940
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,800
Bye.

941
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,910
Hello, this way.

942
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Your brother happens to have

943
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
an appointment with someone else right now,

944
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,190
so he asked me to treat you,

945
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,760
saying that as long as the doctors' medical skills are good,

946
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,090
it's all the same to you.

947
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,000
What a petty man!

948
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,600
What?

949
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,080
Nothing.

950
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,840
Thank you.

951
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,430
Did your brother apply

952
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,430
for a college in Singapore

953
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,430
because his mother is in Singapore?

954
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,840
So is he closer to his mother

955
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,320
or his father?

956
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,710
He's close to both of them.

957
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,150
Don't try to cover it for him.

958
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,710
Based on my observation of him,

959
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,310
he's not close to any of them.

960
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,840
But your brother

961
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,190
is good with kids.

962
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,600
When we have

963
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,360
a child patient's appointment,

964
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,620
we let him deal with it.

965
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,670
Only by yesterday,

966
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,760
did I find out

967
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
that he had another younger sister in Singapore.

968
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,120
She's much younger than him.

969
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,250
No wonder he's experienced with kids.

970
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,060
Have you ever met his younger sister?

971
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,230
Yes, a couple of times.

972
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,870
Your brother...

973
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,470
Miss Feng,

974
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,430
I have an appointment in a while.

975
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,910
It won't take long extracting a tooth nerve, will it?

976
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,510
No, it won't. It'll be quick.

977
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,690
Come here to take the medicine with me.

978
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,120
He's always like this,

979
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,720
as if everyone is in his debt.

980
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,950
At the last award exhibition,

981
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,190
what impressed me the most

982
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,590
is your work with Miss Li.

983
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,120
Two Boys and A Girl

984
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,360
at the age of 17

985
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,840
symbolizes the lost youth

986
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,950
and Dream Lover

987
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,280
represents growing up.

988
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,600
It's awesome.

989
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,000
I like that piece

990
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,760
of work too.

991
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,670
When that idea

992
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,520
came to me,

993
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,760
I was so excited that I couldn't fall asleep all night long.

994
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,360
Bro,

995
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,150
please come to our studio a lot

996
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,150
in the future.

997
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,000
May I have your WeChat number?

998
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
Sure!

999
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,560
He's not like

1000
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,690
what I've imagined.

1001
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,430
So what did you imagine?

1002
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,870
I thought

1003
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,120
he should be someone

1004
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,000
with long hair,

1005
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,910
like a wild punk.

1006
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,280
Or someone

1007
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
in dark style.

1008
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,010
But unexpectedly,

1009
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,950
he's such a sunny young man.

1010
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,520
Does my microblog

1011
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,580
give people an impression like that?

1012
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,430
No wonder your two brothers

1013
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,040
thought I was a dangerous man.

1014
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,670
Brothers?

1015
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,190
Aren't you the only child in your family?

1016
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,190
Yes, I am.

1017
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,600
My two brothers

1018
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,910
grew up together with me,

1019
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,510
but we're not blood related.

1020
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,670
They're the prototypes

1021
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,080
of the two boys of Two Boys and A Girl.

1022
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,360
They were studying abroad

1023
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
and just came back.

1024
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,120
Several days ago,

1025
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,230
they knew that Li Jianjian and I were going to meet.

1026
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,430
She happened to break her phone

1027
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,000
and when her two brothers couldn't get in touch with her,

1028
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,280
they were about to call the police.

1029
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,120
Call the police? Really?

1030
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,390
Do your brothers

1031
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,910
have sister complex?

1032
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Probably!

1033
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,150
No.

1034
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,710
When I was little,

1035
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,150
some strangers almost took me away

1036
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,710
under my brother's eyes,

1037
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,080
and the lingering effect is

1038
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,840
that he always worries about me

1039
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
a lot.

1040
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,320
Do your two brothers

1041
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,950
have other siblings?

1042
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,470
Yes.

1043
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,150
Then their siblings...

1044
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,390
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

1045
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,050
Let's eat together. My treat.

1046
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,320
Let's go.

1047
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,090
Let's go.

1048
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,190
You've never talked

1049
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,250
about them before.

1050
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,380
That's not important.

1051
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,560
What would you like to eat?
