00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,760
Episode 6

4
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not silly.

5
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
I know it wasn't my fault.

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
Then why are you so upset?

7
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,320
It was not you who fell over.

8
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,079
She's still a kid after all.

9
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,360
And she had a fracture.

10
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,960
These days,

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,079
Ling Xiao has been frequenting the hospital

12
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,120
as soon as school was over

13
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,480
and even stayed there.

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
I haven't seen him for days.

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
He must be so upset.

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,079
Right.

17
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,320
He has to face

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,480
his thick-skinned mom

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,400
and annoying sister all day long.

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,640
How could he be happy?

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
So,

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,880
I got him into trouble.

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,280
It was my fault.

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
Do you think if Qin Meiyang didn't fall and have a fracture,

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
the three generations of women including his grandma

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
wouldn't annoy him?

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,120
Well.

28
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,360
Anyway, they'll go back soon.

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
And our world

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
will be peaceful again.

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Hey.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
If you keep gazing like this, you'll become

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,360
a stone gazing out for your husband.

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Heat the dishes.

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,520
Ling Xiao,

36
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,400
you are back.

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,520
You are tired, right?

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,640
Did you have supper?

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
You must be very hungry.

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
There is sweet potato rice

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
and half a bowl of braised pork in brown sauce in the pot.

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm telling you.

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,760
Today's braised pork

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,800
was perfectly stewed.

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
If I didn't keep half a bowl of it for you,

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,079
Ziqiu would have eaten it up.

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,079
I'm not hungry.

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm going upstairs, take a shower, and go to bed.

49
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,200
Little Spring, you should wash your hair.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,280
Ling Xiao,

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
I didn't expect that to happen.

52
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,400
Don't think too much.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm on your side.

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,240
I'm hungry now.

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,280
Didn't you keep

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,840
braised pork in brown sauce for me?

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,760
Yes.

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
Let's go and eat braised pork in brown sauce.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,680
I can have another portion with you.

60
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,440
Your breakfast.

61
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Why did you go so far to buy it?

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,520
You love it, don't you?

63
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,920
As Dad said,

64
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,840
eat something good

65
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,800
and cheer up.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,080
During this period of time,

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,240
Ling Xiao

68
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,760
comes to the hospital every evening.

69
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,960
He goes to school in the daytime

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,800
and comes here to accompany his sister.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
As a mother, you are at leisure.

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,520
But Ling Xiao is in the third year at high school.

73
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
I know.

74
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,040
Don't worry.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,640
Ling Xiao has no problem with his studies.

76
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,600
Actually, I'm not willing to let that happen,

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,400
but,

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,200
you know,

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,760
when Ling Xiao attends classes in the daytime,

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Chengzi can't see him.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,400
In the evening,

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,600
if she can't see Ling Xiao again,

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,640
she would make a tearful scene.

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,680
I can do nothing about it.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,000
You are spoiling her.

86
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,560
I think,

87
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,280
you haven't lived together for long,

88
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
so you have no feelings.

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,000
You only gave birth to Chengzi?

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
How could you say that?

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Didn't I do this

92
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,040
as you said?

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,440
You asked me

94
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,000
to use Chengzi to ease

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,280
the tension between Ling Xiao and me.

96
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,600
I didn't ask you

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
to let Ling Xiao

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
come to accompany Chengzi at night.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,520
Look at your son's dark circles under his eyes.

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,760
No matter what I do,

101
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,680
you think it is wrong.

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,600
Then do something right

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
and let me see.

104
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,000
When you boast about

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
your rich son-in-law,

106
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,440
when you sit in the Benz，

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,120
and when he gives you money,

108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,000
you think

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm always right.

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,880
You know,

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,480
except that,

112
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,720
what else can I praise you about?

113
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,240
Others' daughters

114
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
can take care of their parents by their side.

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,800
But you

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,000
married to a place so far away.

117
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,800
When I'm sick,

118
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,240
in addition to sending me some money,

119
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,680
what else can you do?

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Do I really need

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,160
the money you send me?

122
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,600
In my life,

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,440
I can't expect you to look after me.

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
Why are you here so late?

125
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,200
I was busy in my restaurant, so I'm late.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,560
Well.

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,680
Where is Chengzi?

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,400
She is playing in the next ward.

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
Actually, you don't need to

130
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,920
bring meals here every day.

131
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,840
It is convenient to eat nearby.

132
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,920
It is convenient.

133
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
But the food outside is not clean.

134
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,600
Right. It is not clean.

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,800
And it is convenient for me to come here.

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
Besides, there will be no need soon.

137
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,560
Right?

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,040
When will she be discharged from hospital?

139
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Tomorrow.

140
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,040
So you don't need to bring food here anymore.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
She'll be discharged from hospital tomorrow.

142
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,400
Good. Good.

143
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
OK. I won't disturb you.

144
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,760
I, I've got to go.

145
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Wait. Wait.

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,440
I happen to...

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
I

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,960
will go back to Singapore next month.

149
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
This money is for you.

150
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,440
Don't think it's too little.

151
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,240
No need. No need.

152
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,760
You don't need to give me money.

153
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,280
Here's the thing.

154
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
Listen to me.

155
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
I haven't stayed with Ling Xiao

156
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,720
for so long.

157
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,320
Because you've been taking care of him,

158
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
he has become so excellent.

159
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
I've always wanted to thank you,

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,360
but

161
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,840
I don't know how to express my thanks.

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
So, I feel

163
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,200
I must do something.

164
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
Besides, in the days to come,

165
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,160
I'll still have to bother you to take care of him, right?

166
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Take it.

167
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,560
I said no need. No need.

168
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,680
I'm telling you.

169
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,360
In my heart,

170
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,159
I raise Ling Xiao as my own son.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,840
Rest assured.

172
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,200
Without the money, I can still

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,440
take good care of him.

174
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,240
I've got to go.

175
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,200
See?

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
He raises the child of our family

177
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,120
as his own son.

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
What did I tell you back then?

179
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
You could divorce.

180
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
But if you didn't want the child to go with you,

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
you would regret it sooner or later.

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
Ask Chengzi to come back for dinner.

183
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,920
Go!

184
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
Come back during school holidays.

185
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
The plane is taking off soon. It is taking off.

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,160
Good girl.

187
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's go.

188
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,720
Finally, the two people

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
are leaving.

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,520
Slow down. Slow down.

191
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,110
[Like a breeze]

192
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,880
Be careful. Be careful.

193
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,840
[with words  to say]

194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,480
Slow down.

195
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,670
[I suddenly]

196
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
[realize that]

197
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,960
[those seemingly insignificant days are full of love]

198
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,910
[Realize, realize]

199
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,470
[that I can have all the happiness]

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,030
[As natural as the breeze]

201
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,710
[By your side]

202
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,880
[Like a breeze]

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,590
[whispering softly]

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,640
Let's go.

205
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
[I suddenly]

206
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,960
[realize that]

207
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,710
[those seemingly insignificant days are full of love]

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,670
[Realize, realize]

209
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,230
[that at the trivial moments]

210
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,790
[warmth is hidden in the details]

211
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,470
[Sometimes]

212
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,400
[Everything]

213
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,150
[Like a breeze]

214
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,880
[with words to say]

215
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,710
[I suddenly]

216
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,230
[realize that]

217
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,000
[I like it more than I can imagine]

218
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,960
[Realize, realize]

219
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,520
[that everything around me]

220
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,080
[is love]

221
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I want to have spicy strips.

222
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,240
In a few days,

223
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,240
if you have your teeth which are always inflamed

224
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,160
pulled out,

225
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,080
I'll buy you spicy strips.

226
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,480
I'd better not eat them.

227
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,880
Life is boring.

228
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,520
Didn't Qi Mingyue say

229
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
she would come to play?

230
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,400
In the final exam,

231
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,440
she got the third place.

232
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
Her mom said she fell behind,

233
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
so, she signed up for a cram school for her.

234
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,600
This holiday is so boring.

235
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,640
Hello?

236
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,400
This is Li Jianjian speaking.

237
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
You are a cheater, right?

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
Go to hell, cheater!

239
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,720
What cheater?

240
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
I was told that I won an award in the wood carving competition.

241
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,120
When did I

242
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,160
take part in the competition?

243
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,080
Cheaters don't investigate before they cheat people.

244
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Again?

245
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,040
I'll curse you.

246
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
Let me answer the phone.

247
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,720
Dis him.

248
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Hello?

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,240
Yes, this is Li Jianjian's home.

250
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,720
Right?

251
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
I sent the work there.

252
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm her brother.

253
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
She doesn't know.

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,480
Thank you.

255
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,960
OK. OK.

256
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,200
OK. OK.

257
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,120
Take it away.

258
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
You are too short.

259
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,120
Hold her tightly.

260
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Look. Look.

261
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,080
How is it?

262
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,840
It is exactly right.

263
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,320
Then I'll paste it.

264
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,480
An Auspicious Year of Tiger

265
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,560
Let me see. Let me see.

266
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,440
Look. This is askew.

267
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Well.

268
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,160
Jianjian,

269
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,160
what award did you win?

270
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
Mrs. Qian, I,

271
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,720
I won

272
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,560
a gold award.

273
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
If you come to have noodles, we'll give you a 20% discount.

274
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,560
OK. OK.

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,840
Congratulations.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Thank you.

277
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,160
Jianjian, go and answer the phone.

278
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
Look at Jiang Kun...

279
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,940
That face...

280
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,700
What a joyous laugh!

281
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,500
Like the circle.

282
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,040
Happy Spring Festival!

283
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,120
I was just about to call

284
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,400
to wish Uncle and Aunt

285
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,200
a happy Spring Festival.

286
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,240
OK. OK.

287
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,680
Hello, Aunt. Happy Spring Festival!

288
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,360
I don't know.

289
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,560
Dad.

290
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,040
Yes?

291
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,840
Aunt asked

292
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,040
whether we'll going to hometown on the third day of Lunar New Year.

293
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,640
Well. Let me talk to her.

294
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
Wait a moment. My dad is going to talk.

295
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Hello.

296
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,320
Happy Spring Festival!

297
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,280
Here's the thing. We plan to go back on the third day of Lunar New Year.

298
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Call your grandma

299
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,240
to wish her a happy Spring Festival.

300
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
Otherwise, she'll blame you again.

301
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,320
I called.

302
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,320
You, call Aunt He Lan.

303
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,960
I called too.

304
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Good.

305
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,600
OK. OK.

306
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,920
Happy Spring Festival!

307
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,080
Qi Mingyue.

308
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,000
Hello, Mingyue.

309
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,640
Happy Spring Festival!

310
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
Where are you?

311
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,680
Phuket Island？

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Fantastic!

313
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,280
I haven't been out of our province yet.

314
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,520
It is raining there?

315
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,160
Is it cold there?

316
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,520
She asked whether it is cold in Phuket Island.

317
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,440
Well. I haven't been there before.

318
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,640
OK. OK. Go to eat.

319
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,000
OK. OK. You want to talk to Ziqiu, right?

320
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,560
OK.

321
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Hello. What is it?

322
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
OK. Thank you.

323
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
Happy Spring Festival to you too.

324
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,280
Do you want to talk to Ling Xiao?

325
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,880
OK. Bye.

326
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Happy Spring Festival, she said.

327
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,000
Happy Spring Festival!

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
She hung up. No need to say that.

329
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,200
Dad,

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
I want a cellphone.

331
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,000
Why do you want it?

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,160
Your teachers don't allow you

333
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,880
to take it to school.

334
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,920
They both have a cellphone, so I want to have one too.

335
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,600
No.

336
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,480
Yes.

337
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,240
No.

338
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Buy one for me.

339
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,520
We are celebrating the Spring Festival.

340
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,640
Don't make her unhappy.

341
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,920
I'll buy you a cellphone.

342
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,760
Buy the latest style.

343
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,480
Mr. Ling,

344
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,720
you are my own dad.

345
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,840
Here's to you.

346
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
You are spoiling her.

347
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
She is a girl

348
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
who should be spoiled.

349
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
We just can't spoil

350
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
these boys.

351
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,080
Boys.

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,240
Happy Spring Festival!

353
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,240
Fight?

354
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,600
Got it. I'll be there soon.

355
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,320
The family reunion dinner is spoiled.

356
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,560
The husbands of three sisters had a fight.

357
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,560
One man was seriously injured

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,480
by a wine bottle.

359
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,360
There are not enough people on duty,

360
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,240
so I have to go there.

361
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,680
Go. Go.

362
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,640
You guys continue to eat.

363
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
I'll be back after handling the case.

364
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,640
It doesn't matter. We'll keep the dishes for you.

365
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Come back early.

366
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,040
I'll be back soon.

367
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,560
OK.

368
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,520
He hasn't had a meal on time.

369
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,320
Li Jianjian, look.

370
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,200
There comes something that will make you laugh.

371
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,320
That's something will make Ling Xiao laugh.

372
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,160
Am I right?

373
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
You loved to eat it, didn't you?

374
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,800
The jokes are too funny.

375
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,720
In the new semester,

376
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
you'll have a new classmate in our class.

377
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,600
Come in.

378
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,280
OK.

379
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Let the new classmate

380
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,640
introduce herself.

381
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,280
Come on.

382
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,120
Hello, everybody. My name is Tang Can.

383
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm glad

384
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,640
to be your classmate.

385
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
Last year, because of acting in films,

386
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,720
I failed to go up to the next year.

387
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,800
In the future, due to my work,

388
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,920
I may delay my schoolwork.

389
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,520
I hope you can help me

390
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,640
with my studies.

391
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,640
Thank you all.

392
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,640
Are you the heroine of

393
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,320
the chocolate popsicle commercial？

394
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Exactly.

395
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,680
I'll treat you to it.

396
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,360
Great!

397
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,000
Tang Can,

398
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,349
sit there.,

399
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,280
behind the monitor of our class.

400
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,880
OK.

401
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,800
Qi Mingyue,

402
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,310
take care of the new classmate.

403
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,760
OK.

404
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,800
The new semester begins.

405
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,920
So, concentrate on your studies.

406
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,800
Next week,

407
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
you'll take

408
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,560
an assessment test,

409
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
which is about your holiday assignments.

410
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,440
Get ready for it.

411
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,109
Hello.

412
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,109
My name is Qi Mingyue.

413
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,069
If you have any question,

414
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,880
you can come to me.

415
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,829
OK. Thank you.

416
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,160
You're welcome.

417
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,120
Open your textbook and turn to page 3.

418
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,560
Lesson One, Moonlight over the Lotus Pond.

419
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,760
Bye-bye.

420
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,040
Tang Can, bye.

421
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
Bye.

422
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Bye, Tang Can.

423
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
Tang Can, your...

424
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,480
Mingyue.

425
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,680
Let's go.

426
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,280
Tang Can's bus card dropped.

427
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm going to give it to her.

428
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
Tang Can, your...

429
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,400
I think she's a racewalker.

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,080
She must be in such a hurry to do something.

431
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,920
She is so fast.

432
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,480
In addition to the sweet milk,

433
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
there are crisp nuts with chocolate.

434
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
Do you want to have a try?

435
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
Mm. So crisp.

436
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,520
Have you tasted the sweet food today?

437
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,520
Do you remember

438
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,360
the commercial often broadcasted during the summer holiday?

439
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,160
Do you remember it?

440
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,120
I've watched the commercial before,

441
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,480
but I didn't pay attention to

442
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,120
the girl.

443
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,520
Have you watched it before?

444
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
I seldom watch TV.

445
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
Anyway, this girl

446
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
just transferred to our class today.

447
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
When she just arrived,

448
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,040
she was like Miss Universe.

449
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,680
But after school was over,

450
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,600
she went outside the school

451
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,480
and changed her clothes.

452
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,640
She was very affected.

453
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,560
She sits behind me.

454
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
What should I do in the future?

455
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,800
What are you worrying about?

456
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,720
We got the goods

457
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,640
on her.

458
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,960
She should worry.

459
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,520
It's easy to say that.

460
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,440
It's nothing. I'll protect you.

461
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,360
Ling Xiao,

462
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Ziqiu,

463
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,960
go and get the noodles for yourselves.

464
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,400
OK.

465
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,200
Mingyue.

466
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
Here are the beef noodles for you.

467
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,200
I've added chili.

468
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
If it is not enough, you can add by yourself.

469
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Thank you, Mr. Li.

470
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,560
This is for you.

471
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,720
Thank you, Mr. Li.

472
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,200
You came suddenly,

473
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,880
so I didn't have time

474
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,960
to cook good food for you.

475
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,160
Come to my home next.

476
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,560
OK.

477
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll cook tasty food for you.

478
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,680
OK.

479
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,480
Give that to me.

480
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,120
Enjoy it.

481
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,960
Thank you, Mr. Li.

482
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,480
What noodles are you having?

483
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,080
Noodles with sweet and sour spare ribs.

484
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,360
Others don't have the luck to enjoy them,

485
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,600
because only

486
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,920
the three of us love them.

487
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
They taste sweet. Do you want to have a taste?

488
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,360
No, no. I love spicy food.

489
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,480
Here you are.

490
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,440
It feels so good.

491
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,840
I want to have a brother too.

492
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,200
Pick one. I'll give him to you

493
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,720
for free.

494
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't want to have either of them as my brother.

495
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,440
Why?

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,960
Didn't you praise

497
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,640
Ziqiu by saying that he looks so cool when he plays basketball?

498
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
I didn't.

499
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,880
You don't think I'm cool?

500
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,160
I,

501
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,760
I didn't say that.

502
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
You said that.

503
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,360
No.

504
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,640
It bothers me to talk to you girls.

505
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,000
You beat around the bush and I don't understand what you are talking about.

506
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,240
You are too stupid,

507
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,440
so you don't understand.

508
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh?

509
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,520
You understand? You are experienced?

510
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,960
Since childhood, the only girl

511
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
you have talked to with more than 100 words

512
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,760
is Li Jianjian, right?

513
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm Ling Xiao's whole world.

514
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,280
No.

515
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,160
I've talked to Qi Mingyue

516
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,040
with more than 100 words too.

517
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,720
That's true.

518
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,800
You are awesome.

519
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,840
You can enter a fairy's world.

520
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,760
Students who lag behind, come on!

521
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,080
You'll cross the finishing line soon.

522
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,920
Come on. Come on.

523
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Swing your arms.

524
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,960
Swing your arms slowly.

525
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,560
Hurry. Sprint. Come on.

526
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,120
The last...

527
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,760
Don't sit. Get up.

528
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,720
Get up. Get up.

529
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,080
Get up and relax. Come on.

530
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,560
Come on. Get up. Get up.

531
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,400
Come on.

532
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,120
Get up. Get up. Don't sit.

533
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,320
Let's go. Let's go.

534
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,920
Walk. Walk.

535
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Relax. Relax.

536
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
Those who lag behind, come on.

537
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,440
Come on. Walk.

538
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,680
Look over there.

539
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Tang Can joined

540
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
the group of girls who don't run for four times a month.

541
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
Don't point at her. She saw us.

542
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,520
She is staring at me.

543
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,080
Forget it. Forget it.

544
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,880
Forget it.

545
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,680
Let's go. Let's go.

546
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,960
Ziqiu is playing basketball.

547
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
Let's go and watch him play basketball.

548
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,880
Let's go. Let's go.

549
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,200
Ziqiu. Ziqiu.

550
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,480
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

551
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,720
Water.

552
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,560
Thank you.

553
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,240
You're welcome.

554
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,000
He Ziqiu.

555
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,400
I...

556
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,280
It's me.

557
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm your dad.

558
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm your dad!

559
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,800
You are crazy.

560
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
Is He Mei your mom's name?

561
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm

562
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,800
Zhao Huaguang.

563
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,320
Your mom mentioned me to you, didn't she?

564
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,400
No.

565
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,120
I don't live with her.

566
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,640
I know.

567
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
When you were very little,

568
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
your mom abandoned you

569
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,920
and left.

570
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,040
She went away

571
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,240
with the money your foster father gave her.

572
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,240
Your mom

573
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,320
despises the poor and curries favor with the rich.

574
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,680
Back then. she divorced me

575
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,720
because I was poor.

576
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,080
Just why do you come to me?

577
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,400
If there's nothing, I've got to go.

578
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm your dad.

579
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,320
I know.

580
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
When my grandma was alive,

581
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,560
she scolded you every day.

582
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,200
So just what do you want to do?

583
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,080
I...

584
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,760
I...

585
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,240
I want to see you.

586
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,600
If you want to see what I look like,

587
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,520
you've seen.

588
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,440
I've got to go.

589
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,720
Don't come to see me again.

590
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,240
OK?

591
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,760
I have nothing to do with you.

592
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,680
Ziqiu,

593
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,320
back then, your mom divorced me.

594
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,200
If your grandma didn't come to me,

595
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
I didn't know that your mom gave birth to you.

596
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720
I was too poor,

597
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
and everybody looked down upon me.

598
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,320
It's not that I didn't want to raise you, my child.

599
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,000
I couldn't afford to raise you.

600
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,920
I didn't have the conditions.

601
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,320
If I had money back then,

602
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,400
could I let you

603
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,640
depend on another man

604
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,120
for a living?

605
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,360
Child,

606
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
I can imagine

607
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,040
life is too hard for you.

608
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,800
What do you want to talk about?

609
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,880
Can't you see

610
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,120
I have a good life now?

611
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,200
I'll tell you this once again.

612
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,240
I have nothing to do with you.

613
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,960
Don't say words

614
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,880
to move yourself, OK?

615
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,120
Ziqiu,

616
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,480
let me finish what I want to say.

617
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,480
Your foster father

618
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
is running a noodles restaurant, right?

619
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,720
If you continue to live with him,

620
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,360
you won't get the best education,

621
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,040
or have a good future.

622
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,520
I come to see you

623
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,080
not to ask you to recognize me.

624
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,040
I didn't mean to do that.

625
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,280
But I should be responsible for

626
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,840
your future.

627
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,760
You know? Ziqiu.

628
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,880
I live abroad now.

629
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Go abroad with me.

630
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,560
You can go to

631
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,920
the best university.

632
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,640
I've never thought of

633
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,360
studying abroad.

634
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,320
Let go of me!

635
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,720
Ziqiu,

636
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,600
why haven't you thought of that?

637
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,640
Because you didn't have the conditions.

638
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,320
But now you have the conditions.

639
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,200
You should think about it.

640
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,120
Are you crazy?

641
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
Ziqiu. Ziqiu. Ziqiu.

642
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,080
I'm telling you. A girl

643
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
transferred to our class

644
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,160
and she joined

645
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,920
the group of girls who don't run for four times a month.

646
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,360
What group?

647
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,400
Ziqiu,

648
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,840
why are you behind us? Come on.

649
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,720
Come on.

650
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,520
What's wrong with you? You are not happy today.

651
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,360
He didn't do well in his exam.

652
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,480
You look down upon me.

653
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,720
I got 610 points.

654
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,920
I got 700 points.

655
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,920
Shut up.

656
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,440
How could you compare your score in the science class with my score in the arts class?

657
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,120
You must be joking.

658
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,760
What is your score? What are you laughing about?

659
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
Don't mention it.

660
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,920
Such a thing is not worth mentioning.

661
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,160
Dad, we're back.

662
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,680
We are back.

663
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,200
OK.

664
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
What occasion is it today? There are so many dishes.

665
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,640
High school students, you are back.

666
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,800
-Aunt He Lan.
-Aunt He Lan.

667
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,760
Aunt He Lan, why are you here?

668
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,320
I come to the city

669
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,440
to buy some drugs for ducks

670
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,120
and send

671
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,760
some goods from the mountain to you by the way.

672
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,480
At my home,

673
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,680
we've dried a dozen jin of Chinese torreya nuts.

674
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,840
You feel tired after studying hard, right?

675
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,840
They can nourish your brains.

676
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,320
-Thank you, Aunt He Lan. 
-Thank you, Aunt He Lan.

677
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,960
-Thank you, Aunt He Lan.
-You're welcome.

678
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,120
Make way for me.

679
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,520
Look what I made.

680
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,240
Bamboo shoot soup with fresh and pickled streaky pork.

681
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,040
It smells good, right?

682
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,760
Your uncle dug the bamboo shoots

683
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,280
in the mountain.

684
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,000
They are free.

685
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,320
We got them from the mountain.

686
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,200
Aunt He Lan.

687
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,440
Yes?

688
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,480
I want to go to your home to play during the summer holiday.

689
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
I want to pick wild fruit.

690
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,440
Welcome.

691
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,240
Ask Ziqiu

692
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,480
to take you to

693
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,640
find hares' hole.

694
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,320
That's funny.

695
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,920
OK. OK.

696
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,000
We'll go there during the summer holiday.

697
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,560
OK. OK.

698
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,720
Let's eat. I'm starving.

699
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,480
Ziqiu.

700
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,880
Yes?

701
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
You sleep with Ling Xiao tonight.

702
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,120
It's too late. Your aunt will stay.

703
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,800
Oh. OK.

704
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,840
No. I can sleep on the sofa.

705
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,080
Don't affect them.

706
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,440
It doesn't matter.

707
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,400
Thank you, Dad.

708
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,320
Eat. Eat.

709
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,040
Let's eat.

710
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,280
Have a shrimp.

711
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,800
OK. OK.

712
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,280
Is your dad calling?

713
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,200
No.

714
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,280
Chengzi called.

715
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,240
That annoying girl.

716
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,320
She calls a lot of times every day,

717
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,240
which is really annoying.

718
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,440
Her family is rich,

719
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,480
so she dares to do that.

720
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,040
Have some soup.

721
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,280
You have it.

722
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,920
I can have three bowls of rice.

723
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,200
Eat more.

724
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,080
Ziqiu, you haven't gone to bed?

725
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,160
I'll take part in the National College Entrance Examination soon.

726
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,080
I want to take a few books

727
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,120
upstairs to review.

728
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,960
Right.

729
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,320
After studying hard for these few months

730
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,760
and being admitted to a university, you'll be relaxed.

731
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,600
Yes.

732
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,000
OK.

733
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,160
Aunt He Lan, I'm going upstairs.

734
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,640
OK.

735
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,720
Go to bed early.

736
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,680
Don't study too late.

737
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,600
Aunt He Lan,

738
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,440
I want to ask you something.

739
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,960
What is it?

740
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,200
Aunt He Lan, take a seat.

741
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,480
OK.

742
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,120
What do you want to ask?

743
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,640
Well.

744
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,320
Do you still remember

745
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,120
Zhao Huaguang?

746
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,560
Why do you think of him suddenly?

747
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
During the physical examination at school,

748
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,920
we were asked whether we have any family genetic disease.

749
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I haven't heard about that.

750
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,080
Zhao Huaguang's dad

751
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,880
is over 70 years old now,

752
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,840
but he still works in the field.

753
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,240
I heard that

754
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,120
he is prosperous now.

755
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,600
He has made a lot of money by doing business.

756
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,320
He lives abroad now.

757
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,280
He almost becomes a foreigner.

758
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,600
There is just one mountain

759
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,080
between their hometown and ours.

760
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,080
It was particularly poor.

761
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,840
There was one path leading to their village.

762
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,360
Even cars couldn't enter.

763
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,360
But I heard that a few years ago,

764
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,560
he spent some money

765
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,080
on building a bridge and a road for their village.

766
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,840
Now,

767
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,320
even trucks carrying vegetables

768
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,360
can get into the village.

769
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,280
You know.

770
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,640
He couldn't even support his wife

771
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,440
and child before.

772
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
But now he is rich

773
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,680
and has become a benefactor.

774
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
He is really rich.

775
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,000
He is not capable at all.

776
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,520
He is just good-looking.

777
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,440
A girl whose family is extraordinarily rich

778
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,680
fell in love with him.

779
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,680
Her family does coal business.

780
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,560
So, he followed her family

781
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,840
to make money through doing business.

782
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,000
Well.

783
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,560
Doesn't he have a child?

784
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,480
Child?

785
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,960
They have done too many bad things.

786
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,800
They have no offspring.

787
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,040
Anyway, I remember

788
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,080
Grandma always scolded him.

789
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,840
Right.

790
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,320
When your grandma

791
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,040
saw him for the first time,

792
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,800
she said that this man has a lot of artful talk

793
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
and that he's not a good man.

794
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,000
Forget it.

795
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,960
Anyway,

796
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,400
I haven't heard that he has any genetic disease.

797
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,040
How about

798
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,560
I ask about it for you after I go back?

799
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,840
No need, Aunt He Lan.

800
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,360
I just asked that casually.

801
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,640
OK.

802
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,920
Aunt He Lan, go to bed early.

803
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,720
I'm going upstairs.

804
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,680
Sleep early.

805
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,120
OK.

806
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,960
Don't study too late.

807
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,560
Are you asleep?

808
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,480
Yes.

809
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,640
You talk when you are asleep?

810
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,520
How about you sleep on the floor?

811
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't like sleeping in the same bed

812
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,560
with another person.

813
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,400
Come to sleep on the floor.

814
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,160
I'll sleep in the bed.

815
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,320
If you want to sleep in the bed, you can go downstairs.

816
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,240
Why are you here?

817
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,040
No.

818
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm afraid that you will speak ill of me.

819
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,920
What can we talk about you?

820
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,560
Anyway,

821
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
you can't have any secret

822
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,800
between you guys.

823
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,320
I must know everything.

824
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,760
What secret can we have

825
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,800
that you don't know?

826
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,720
There may be some secrets.

827
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,360
Ziqiu, you are not happy today.

828
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
But you didn't say anything about it.

829
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
Boy,

830
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,120
you've grown up.

831
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,040
I can't control you.

832
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,320
You begin to have your own thought.

833
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,280
You begin to hide something from your sister.

834
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,640
You are crazy.

835
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,960
See?

836
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,120
You become angry from embarrassment.

837
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,320
Tell me.

838
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,920
Just what's wrong with you?

839
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
I just feel a little,

840
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,880
a little uneasy.

841
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,320
Why?

842
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,120
I wonder whether

843
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,160
because I have such a happy life

844
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,520
that I'm afraid others will spoil it.

845
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,480
Who will spoil it?

846
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,800
I don't know.

847
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,520
With too much pressure in your studies,

848
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,960
you can have paranoia that others will hurt you.

849
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm thinking about life. OK?

850
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,280
Why are you thinking about it?

851
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,600
Can it be thought about?

852
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,480
The more you think about life,

853
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
the more you can't understand.

854
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,240
You even know that?

855
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,400
Who taught you that?

856
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,160
In class,

857
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,400
I thought about life and got it.

858
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What if we don't think about life?

859
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,120
Just live.

860
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,960
Live one day after another.

861
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,080
Live today and then tomorrow.

862
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,520
Eat, sleep, and worry about exams.

863
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,320
If you can't forget today's worry,

864
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,560
you'll have tomorrow's worry.

865
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,600
As long as you are alive,

866
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,480
live one day after another.

867
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,280
One day after another.

868
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,480
Without end.

869
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,000
What I said are in rhyme.

870
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,160
According to what you said,

871
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,520
I feel life is boring.

872
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,680
Because it is boring,

873
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,320
you have to live your life in an interesting way.

874
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,560
Young man,

875
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,120
when you come across something annoying,

876
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,560
don't be so hard on yourself.

877
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Eat something good.

878
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,840
Drink something good.

879
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,720
Do something to make you happy.

880
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,000
I didn't expect Li Jianjian of our family

881
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,040
can come up with

882
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,280
so many life principles.

883
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,920
You are to be congratulated.

884
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
Why? You begin to admire me?

885
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,720
If you make less trouble,

886
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
I'll admire you more.

887
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,320
When did I make trouble?

888
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,520
Last week, the two of you

889
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,360
went to the internet bar to play games

890
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,240
and were almost caught

891
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,040
by the dean of studies. Did you forget that?

892
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,880
I was unlucky.

893
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,560
Will you go there again?

894
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,600
No, no.

895
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,280
I won't go to that bar.

896
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,920
I'll go to another one.

897
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,280
Li Jianjian,

898
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
Ziqiu is going to take part in the National College Entrance Examination.

899
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,600
Can you be good?

900
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,120
Well. Well. I got it.

901
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,160
You are annoying.

902
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,670
Ziqiu, are you asleep?

903
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,440
Yes.

904
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,600
Stop talking. Sleep.

905
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,670
Ling Xiao, I can't sleep.

906
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
Count sheep.

907
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,040
One sheep, two sheep,

908
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,520
three, four, five sheep.

909
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
Six sheep.

910
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,880
Seven sheep.

911
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,880
Eight, nine, ten sheep.

912
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,440
Ziqiu, why are you behind us?

913
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:38,960
Come on.

914
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,710
Come on.

915
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,800
The third place.

916
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,680
My mom is going to scold me again.

917
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm in the third place too.

918
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,760
I'm in the third place, if we count backwards.

919
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,040
I'm the last but two now!

920
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,240
I made progress.

921
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm telling you.

922
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,440
My results are stable.

923
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
I was always the last but one.

924
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,320
Let me see who did worse than me.

925
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
The big star.

926
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,960
She is crying.

927
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,040
Tang Can, don't cry.

928
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,080
She is affected.

929
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,720
As the last but two,

930
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,800
what are you proud of?

931
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,840
Tang Can just transferred to this school,

932
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,400
and she didn't familiarize the test scope at all.

933
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
In essence, you are still the last but one.

934
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,720
Besides,

935
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
is there any different between the last but one

936
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,160
and the last but two?

937
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,800
Is there any difference?

938
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,160
Yes.

939
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,080
What is it?

940
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
Yes?

941
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,960
Yes.

942
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,080
Yes.

943
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,560
Li Jianjian...

944
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,000
Mr. Huang.

945
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,360
Tang Can's mom.

946
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,600
Stand outside

947
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,480
and think about it.

948
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Whether the answer is yes or no?

949
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,880
Tang Can's mom,

950
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,280
you came to talk to me

951
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,360
because of Tang Can's results, right?

952
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,920
Generally, students who just transfer

953
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,440
don't get good results.

954
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,640
You don't need to worry too much.

955
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
No, Mr. Huang,

956
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm here to ask for leave for Tang Can.

957
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,880
You want to ask for leave?

958
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,800
Yes.

959
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Tang Can needs to act

960
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,440
for a commercial.

961
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
We are leaving for Shanghai on Friday.

962
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,800
The shooting will begin on Friday afternoon

963
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,920
and it will take about three working days.

964
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,320
If everything goes well,

965
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,440
we'll be back in the morning on Tuesday

966
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,120
and come to school for classes

967
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,000
in the afternoon.

968
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,840
I see.

969
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,840
In order not to delay

970
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
Can's studies,

971
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,080
we've already put off

972
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,840
a print hard advertising film

973
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
till the next weekend.

974
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,000
We have

975
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,240
tried our best to coordinate the time.

976
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:55,760
Look.

977
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,440
Although art colleges

978
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,160
don't require high grades in the subjects,

979
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,240
you can't lag too much.

980
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,720
Right.

981
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,960
In this regard,

982
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,760
Can is particularly self-disciplined.

983
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,480
As long as the director says cut,

984
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,960
she studies aside

985
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,080
and never plays.

986
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,240
OK.

987
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,040
Tang Can,

988
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,800
come on.

989
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,280
In the future, perhaps

990
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,640
I can only see you on TV.

991
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,560
There are so many people for that commercial.

992
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,600
Perhaps there won't be

993
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,720
no independent shots for me.

994
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,160
That's not interesting.

995
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,240
Moreover, I got the last place,

996
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,320
which is very shameful.

997
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,960
I don't have time to study.

998
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,640
That's not shameful.

999
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,480
Didn't your teacher explain it to us?

1000
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,840
Because you didn't know

1001
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,280
the scope.

1002
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,760
Mom,

1003
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,320
I want to be an actress and act in films and dramas.

1004
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,560
I don't want act for commercials and hard ads.

1005
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,320
You

1006
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,760
are lazy

1007
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,720
and playful.

1008
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,280
Rest assured.

1009
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,600
As your agent,

1010
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,400
I promise

1011
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,600
I'll try my best

1012
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,920
to get invitations from big directors for you.

1013
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,320
My daughter is so excellent.

1014
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,920
You'll surely

1015
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
become a big star.

1016
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,640
After I become a big star,

1017
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,880
I won't act for commercials casually.

1018
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Of course.

1019
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,960
When the time comes, a lot of people

1020
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
will queue up at the gate of our home

1021
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,760
and wait for you to act for them.

1022
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,440
Whether you agree or not

1023
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,200
will all depend on

1024
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,440
your mood.

1025
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,040
Well.

1026
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,000
Stop here.

1027
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,760
Go back to attend classes.

1028
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,560
I've got to go.

1029
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,840
Mom,

1030
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,160
I want to

1031
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,440
have pan-fried buns stuffed with pork this evening.

1032
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,560
Don't eat them.

1033
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,960
You'll act for the commercial in a few days.

1034
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,720
Just eat some salad.

1035
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,600
But I have had porridge and salad

1036
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,280
for a few consecutive days.

1037
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,720
Good girl.

1038
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,960
Our big star

1039
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,280
must have perseverance.

1040
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,000
Look at your face.

1041
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,840
It is as fat as a pan-fried bun stuffed with pork.

1042
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,480
Don't eat buns.

1043
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,600
Just eat some salad.

1044
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,760
Go back.

1045
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,800
I've got to go.

1046
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,480
How come there is such a mom?

1047
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
She is pushing her child to make money for her.

1048
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,600
If you don't study hard, what future will you have?

1049
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,640
There are so many Chinese people.

1050
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,520
How many people are popular on TV?

1051
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,360
A star dream is useless.

1052
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,240
But she looks

1053
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,400
really beautiful.

1054
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,800
A beautiful appearance is not as good as a beautiful life.

1055
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Don't learn from her.

1056
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,440
OK.

1057
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,440
By the way,

1058
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,960
last time I let you

1059
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,280
invite Li Jianjian's brothers

1060
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,520
for a dinner. Did you tell her?

1061
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,240
Yes.

1062
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,120
They said OK.

1063
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,200
There is a child

1064
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,880
who got the first place in the grade.

1065
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,840
As parents, they must feel very proud.

1066
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
Actually, as parents,

1067
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,400
we don't...

1068
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,600
Don't wear white clothes.

1069
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,640
You don't keep clean, but you like to wear white clothes.

1070
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,600
If you wash clothes by yourself,

1071
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
you can buy clothes in whatever color you like.

1072
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
Black doesn't suit you.

1073
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,800
You are so young,

1074
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,160
so you should wear bright clothes.

1075
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,480
Don't wear black clothes.

1076
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,560
Salesclerk，

1077
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,240
is there any other color for this?

1078
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,960
There is grey and pink.

1079
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,080
We want a pink one.

1080
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,160
OK. Please wait a moment.

1081
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,240
Hello. Look at this.

1082
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,720
It looks good.

1083
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,320
Come and let me see.

1084
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,120
Do you like it?

1085
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,120
Not too bad.

1086
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,360
In this regard,

1087
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,080
you are exactly alike your dad.

1088
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,760
From eyes to the tone.

1089
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,320
You don't have your own ideas at all.

1090
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,960
You always say not too bad.

1091
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,080
Is there any other style?
