1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,910
Episode 18

4
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,750
It's said

5
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,320
that elites

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,680
in certain areas

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
are more likely to have depression.

8
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
It makes sense for Ling Xiao

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
to have anxiety disorder.

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,680
He's so smart. No wonder he has it.

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Cut it out.

12
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,480
It has nothing

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
to do with that.

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,260
Then it must be because of his mother.

15
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,960
How should I live

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
with such

17
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,079
a mother-in-law?

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
I think we should buy a book

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,680
that makes people sleepy,

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
maybe a world-famous book

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,280
like One Hundred Years of Solitude.

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,940
It makes me sleepy every time.

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,920
OK, I'll take this one.

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,420
It'll make him sleepy.

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,400
Let's go. We still have to

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,920
pick a wallpaper.

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,400
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,840
You're welcome.

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,079
Thank you.

30
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,079
Thank you so much.

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Thank you. Thank you.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Thank you.

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Take care. Take care.

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
Let's do it.

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,760
Good.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,800
Are you sure it'll work?

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,160
Of course!

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
When he feel relaxed,

39
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
he'll feel better

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,130
and fall asleep easily.

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Slower. Slower.

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,840
OK. OK.

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,260
Change your shoes.

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,880
Well,

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,320
I have to take a shower.

46
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,680
No!

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
What if your wound

48
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
gets wet?

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,510
How about you wait a little longer?

50
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,200
I can't wait.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
It itches all over my body.

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,070
Li Jianjian,

53
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,390
no,

54
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,120
Ling Xiao, help me take a bath.

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,680
What are you waiting for?

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Hurry up!

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840
I feel so itchy!

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,680
Let's go.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,840
Don't get the wound wet.

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,880
How nice! I want to have a brother too.

61
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,080
So he can help you take a bath?

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,600
Take them over here after the shower.

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
We're going to have hot pot.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,960
Ziqiu is like this,

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,620
and you want him to eat hot pot?

66
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,300
It's a two-flavor hot pot.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,600
OK. OK.

68
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,840
Don't you want to eat?

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm back.

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,240
You're back.

71
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Let me introduce.

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Please come in.

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Mingyue, do you still remember him?

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,440
When we were in high school,

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,960
the one

76
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,920
who was really good

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,780
at basketball,

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Zhuang Bei.

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,660
This is Qi Mingyue.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,860
I remember him.

81
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
Hello.

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,120
Why are you standing there?

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,760
We're all schoolmates. Sit down, please.

84
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Yes, we're all schoolmates.

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,250
Friend me on WeChat.

86
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,760
In a minute. My phone is getting recharged right now.

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,480
OK!

88
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm going over there.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,140
Hasn't Tang Can come back?

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,480
She prepared all these dishes,

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,400
but she dares not to see you.

92
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
Why did you stand at the door?

93
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,320
Why didn't you knock at the door?

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,720
I didn't knock before.

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,360
Let me see. Let me see.

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,760
Yes.

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,520
Does it hurt?

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,280
It's fine. It's fine.

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,000
Really.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
You just beat me, right?

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
No! I didn't mean it.

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
Then slap me now.

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,400
Slap my naturally beautiful face.

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,480
Are you out of your mind?

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,210
Who would apologize like this?

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't be mad at me.

107
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,800
How could you

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
do that to me?

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,800
I thought

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,460
you had known that he was fine.

112
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
I swear that I won't do it again.

113
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,480
Please don't be mad at me.

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
Hit me.

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
Hit me, please.

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,000
Hit me.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Hit me, please.

118
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
I won't hit you. I kiss you.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Love you!

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,320
My dear Jianjian,

121
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,800
you are really my little angel!

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
Congratulations to you

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,760
for becoming friends again.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,320
Come and join us.

125
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
Your dream guy is here.

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,840
Zhuang Bei?

127
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
I'm going to put on makeup.

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
We're going to have hotpot.

129
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,160
Why would you put on makeup?

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
That's weird!

131
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,480
You're already so pretty without makeup.

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,000
You don't understand girls

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
and I can't communicate with your guys.

134
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Let's eat.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where is Tang Can?

136
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,720
She's removing makeup. Let's eat first.

137
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
Let's eat now. Come.

138
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,040
Let's eat.

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,320
What would you like to have?

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,980
Meat balls.

141
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,320
Thank you.

142
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,850
You're welcome.

143
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
Come. Let's have a toast

144
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,600
to celebrate Ziqiu's escaping from death

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,520
in a great catastrophe!

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,040
OK.

147
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
Come. Thank you. Thank you. Come.

148
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Cheers!

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
Thank you. Thank you.

150
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
I want some meat balls.

151
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,420
Be patient. I'll get them some sauce.

152
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,320
Here you are.

153
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,080
Wait. Wait.

154
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
There's some garlic.

155
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
Will it affect the wound?

156
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
You can have some garlic.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,330
Garlic helps detoxify.

158
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,200
I can finally have some meat,

159
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,880
instead of having porridge all the time.

160
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,040
Get me some tripe. Hurry.

161
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,640
OK.

162
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,320
OK. OK.

163
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,850
Be careful. It's still hot.

164
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,220
What brought you here?

165
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,840
Ziqiu said you were going to have hot pot, so I came.

166
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,360
Make yourself at home and eat more.

167
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,480
After all, you are my client.

168
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
He is your client?

169
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,500
Get me a bottle of beer.

170
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,810
Let's drink.

171
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,810
To our cooperation!

172
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,010
To our cooperation!

173
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm so happy today.

174
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,200
Please eat more and it's on me!

175
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
Come! Let's drink!

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:13,800
Cheers!

177
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,130
It's on you. It's on you.

178
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,560
Cheers!

179
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,480
I can't hide my distressed expression

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm lonely and I don't know what to do

181
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,540
Tang Can, you're awesome!

182
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,840
When I'm alone

183
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,040
it's so quiet that I can only hear my heartbeats

184
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
Please don't ask about

185
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,040
what happened

186
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,760
It really takes a lot

187
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,080
to fall in love with you

188
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,410
Qi Mingyue, Qi Mingyue,

189
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
do you have a boyfriend?

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
No.

191
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,640
Then what do you think

192
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,120
about Ling Xiao and Ziqiu?

193
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,560
I think

194
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,930
they're fine and we're familiar with each other.

195
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,160
Look at the three of them!

196
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
They've been so close to each other

197
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,850
since their childhood,

198
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,320
so those men with sister complex

199
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
can't be a good boyfriend.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Because in their eyes,

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,690
their sisters are always the most important.

202
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
Why?

203
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,760
they're so nice to their sister,

204
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,290
and they'll be nice to their girlfriends too.

205
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,240
Ling Xiao and Ziqiu

206
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,170
are not Jianjian's real brothers.

207
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I think

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,680
two of them

209
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,410
will become a couple in the end.

210
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Li Jianjian and Ziqiu?

211
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,400
Or Ling Xiao and Jianjian.

212
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,880
That's impossible.

213
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,410
Ling Xiao is in love with someone else.

214
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Eat this. Eat this.

215
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
Ling Xiao is in love with someone else?

216
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
Who?

217
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm not sure.

218
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,210
Drink less beer. It's bad for your health.

219
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
I'm happy.

220
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,560
Jianjian,

221
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
did Tang Can teach you how to drink?

222
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,600
It must be.

223
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,720
No.

224
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,280
You think Tang Can

225
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,960
is the play girl,

226
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,920
but actually,

227
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,840
it's Mingyue who likes drinking

228
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,440
and singing.

229
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,360
See?

230
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,920
It really takes a lot

231
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,480
to fall in love with you

232
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,400
I was wrong about her.

233
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,460
You're so excited.

234
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,100
I want to drink.

235
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,880
Call me bro.

236
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,320
Bro.

237
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,120
No!

238
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,180
You're wounded. You can't have beer.

239
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
Put something in the pot.

240
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,300
You're unbelievable!

241
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,560
How to sing this?

242
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,760
If Ziqiu died

243
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
in the car accident yesterday,

244
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,960
I would have really

245
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
regretted it.

246
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Xiao, Ziqiu,

247
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,520
I sincerely welcome you back.

248
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,760
Beer!

249
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,020
Come. Let's have beer.

250
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,840
Then from now on,

251
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,800
we'll just be like what we used to be.

252
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,520
Yes!

253
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Come! Cheers!

254
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,880
Cheers!

255
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,320
Come!

256
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,140
Cheers!

257
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,220
Come!

258
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,640
Good.

259
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,610
I need to go to the bathroom.

260
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,640
In such a situation,

261
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,040
can't you wait a little longer?

262
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,680
It's a physiological need.

263
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,810
What can I do with it?

264
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,840
Let's go.

265
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,480
Across the valley

266
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,160
and across the sky

267
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,400
Hello?

268
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Hello?

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,960
Who is that?

270
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,370
Why did you answer my brother's phone?

271
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,860
[Mei]

272
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,520
This, this is...

273
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,930
Is that Li Jianjian?

274
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,800
That must be Chengzi.

275
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,360
Xiao is...

276
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,120
Your brother is in the bathroom.

277
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,700
When will he come back?

278
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
He'll be back soon.

279
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
I'll let him call you back later.

280
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,120
I mean when he will come back

281
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,080
to Singapore.

282
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,960
He promised

283
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,600
to come back in a month.

284
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,800
Never mind. Just ask him to call me back.

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,520
Bye.

286
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,800
Li Jianjian, it's your song!

287
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Come over here!

288
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,520
Li Jianjian?

289
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,960
Li Jianjian, get up.

290
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,040
Get up and sing.

291
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,780
Li Jianjian, don't sleep here.

292
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,880
Jianjian seems to be drinking too much

293
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,800
Get up.

294
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,000
Jianjian.

295
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,440
She's asleep.

296
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,200
Jianjian.

297
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,500
Let me help you.

298
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,840
Jianjian, go back to your room to sleep.

299
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,320
I'll always be happy

300
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
Where are her slippers?

301
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,200
To write a poem

302
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,400
You sing it.

303
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
Waiting to be noticed

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,520
And I want to untie

305
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,160
those misunderstandings between us

306
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,920
to create a unique feeling

307
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,560
When I met you, it was like a bamboo forest meeting the early summer

308
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,400
and a bird meeting the sea wave

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
What a silly girl!

310
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,450
She hasn't grown up.

311
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,200
Don't say that.

312
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,120
She's already a grown-up young woman.

313
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,250
She's already had a relationship.

314
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,280
I thought there was something wrong

315
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
with Zheng Shuran,

316
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
but now I think he's fine.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
He's not a bad man.

318
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
She's a grown-up young woman

319
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,400
and you can't stop her.

320
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
So just let her do it.

321
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,040
She can do anything else,

322
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,960
but not this.

323
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,800
Now I'm happy

324
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,530
that I don't have a big brother.

325
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,920
Maybe she hates me too.

326
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
I didn't say I hated you.

327
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
I want someone

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
to take care of me

329
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,210
and keep an eye on me.

330
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,240
Really?

331
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Yes.

332
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,160
Please be more confident.

333
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,589
Who would dislike you?

334
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,280
Don't touch me!

335
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,360
Alright, Li Jianjian,

336
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,420
wipe your face before going to sleep.

337
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,120
What's wrong?

338
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,320
It's uncomfortable.

339
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,880
What's uncomfortable?

340
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,580
I forgot to take off her socks.

341
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,000
OK. You don't need to see me off.

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,730
Just go back.

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,040
Then I will go directly to your home the day after tomorrow.

344
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,720
OK. Have a meal with my mother and spend some time with her.

345
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,800
Have you friended her on WeChat?

346
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
Yes, I have.

347
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,680
OK. I'm leaving now.

348
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,680
Go back home.

349
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,440
Wait!

350
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Wait. Wait.

351
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,720
Mr. Zhuang, is this your phone?

352
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,000
I forgot it.

353
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,840
Thank you.

354
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,610
You're welcome.

355
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,480
Then I'm leaving now.

356
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,360
Take care.

357
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,940
Why did he take a picture of us?

358
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
Because he wanted to have

359
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,760
the picture of a beauty.

360
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,400
This is unbearable!

361
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,340
[A flower blooms in my heart every day]

362
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
Xiao, welcome home!

363
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,640
Sleep tight!

364
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,400
Li Jianjian, what are you doing?

365
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,280
OK. OK.

366
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,520
Strawberry jam, strawberry jam.

367
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Jianjian.

368
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,200
Yesterday,

369
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,080
I saw that Chengzi

370
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,800
called me.

371
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Did you answer it?

372
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,440
I didn't mean to do that.

373
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,920
I thought it was mine.

374
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,560
I forgot to tell you

375
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,490
that she asked you to call her back.

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
What did she say?

377
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
She just asked you to call her back.

378
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Will you still go to the shop?

379
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,120
Can you work with your arms like this?

380
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,880
I have to go.

381
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,880
I don't know

382
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,320
how it's going

383
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
these days.

384
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,840
Not bad.

385
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,140
You do look like a boss.

386
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,160
Of course.

387
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,840
I have to take care

388
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,370
of you and dad in the future.

389
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,280
I

390
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,000
took Xiao's phone by mistake yesterday

391
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,800
and I answered

392
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,500
a call from his younger sister in Singapore.

393
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,690
What did she say?

394
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,900
Older Bro told them

395
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,000
that he would go back

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,760
in a month.

397
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,610
Don't listen to her.

398
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
If he would come back for only a month,

399
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,440
why would he have found a job here?

400
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,080
I know.

401
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,080
So Xiao lied to them,

402
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,800
or he wouldn't have been able to come back.

403
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah.

404
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,200
I was wondering

405
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,840
why his mother

406
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,320
had let him come back so easily.

407
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
What to do now?

408
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,600
Nothing.

409
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,530
Even he can't do anything about it.

410
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
Did you lie to Zhao Huaguang

411
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,320
to come back too?

412
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
No.

413
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,450
Zhao Huaguang doesn't care where I am.

414
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,200
Well, he can't stop you anyway.

415
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,730
What are you talking about?

416
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,720
His father.

417
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,040
Zhao Huaguang isn't my father!

418
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,760
Biological father, OK?

419
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Can't you stop it?

420
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,360
See?

421
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,260
Eat my food and smash my plate.

422
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,880
It's fine.

423
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,960
Let's eat.

424
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,920
We've made an appointment,

425
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,400
but Haichao

426
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,040
backed out suddenly.

427
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,410
How could he?

428
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,440
Heping,

429
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,640
would you like to try it?

430
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,560
Well,

431
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,320
a policeman and a teacher can be a great couple.

432
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,560
Come on, Mrs. Qian.

433
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,680
I've finally took two days off,

434
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,740
so please don't get me some more work.

435
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,720
How is this work?

436
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,480
Or would you like to talk to Haichao?

437
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,040
You two are good friends.

438
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,240
What should

439
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,960
I talk to him?

440
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,480
To persuade him to forget about He Mei.

441
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,520
He Mei?

442
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,640
Mrs. Qian,

443
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,080
that was a long time ago

444
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,810
and he has forgotten about her.

445
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,040
You don't know it.

446
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,240
Back then,

447
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,760
Haichao went to several blind dates

448
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
and he liked He Mei the most.

449
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,680
If it had continued,

450
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,560
they would have got married.

451
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,480
But in the end, He Mei refused him.

452
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,280
So there must have been

453
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,480
a shadow one his mind.

454
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,120
Really?

455
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,240
Sure.

456
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,560
Miss Zhu,

457
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
why hasn't Mr. Li

458
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
come back from the grocery?

459
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,930
He didn't go to the grocery.

460
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,680
He went to see Ziqiu.

461
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,000
Your coffee.

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,800
OK. Thank you.

463
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,760
Your pie.

464
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,480
Thank you.

465
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,280
Welcome! Please come and order inside.

466
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,360
Dad, you're here.

467
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,360
Since you're wounded like this,

468
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,600
why don't you rest for a few more days?

469
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,720
It's fine. It has formed a scab.

470
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm fine.

471
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,760
Hello, Mr. He.

472
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
No.

473
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,000
This is Mr. Li.

474
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,160
I don't have my father's last name.

475
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,120
Hello, Mr. Li.

476
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,500
Go on with your job.

477
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,120
OK.

478
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,580
Make a cup of tea for my dad.

479
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,120
OK!

480
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,770
Dad, let's go upstairs.

481
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,960
What's this?

482
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
Fried dumplings for you.

483
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,520
Fried dumplings! Great!

484
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,400
Are they cold?

485
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,970
No, they're still warm.

486
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,240
OK. OK.

487
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,610
There're two fillings. Try them both.

488
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,840
Dad, my coffee shop is not bad, right?

489
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,360
It's good.

490
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,560
How is business?

491
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,160
We're doing activities for the soft opening

492
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,220
and we have a lot of clients every day.

493
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,160
Good.

494
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,840
You know what,

495
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,560
it's really hard

496
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
to run a shop.

497
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,640
You young people

498
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,760
are always passionate

499
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,000
but without a long-term plan.

500
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Don't worry, Dad.

501
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,480
I used to work

502
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,520
in a coffee shop before

503
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,760
and I've tried every kind of work

504
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,890
from cook to waiter.

505
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm not just passionate about it.

506
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,200
Well,

507
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
didn't you work in a hotel restaurant

508
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,160
after graduation?

509
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,040
When did you work in a coffee shop?

510
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I planned to come back

511
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,840
and open a coffee shop,

512
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,440
so

513
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,000
I went to work

514
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280
to learn more

515
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,570
about the management of a coffee shop.

516
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,000
You always

517
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
report only the good

518
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,260
but not the bad over the phone.

519
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,960
It's the same with Ling Xiao.

520
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,960
When I call,

521
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
he always says, "I'm fine.

522
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
Don't worry about me.

523
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,480
I just don't sleep well."

524
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
I know

525
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,920
he has the anxiety disorder.

526
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,440
There's something on his mind.

527
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,800
If there's something on your mind,

528
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,860
you have to tell me.

529
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,080
I got it, Dad.

530
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,080
It was not that I didn't want to tell you,

531
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
but we were so far away from each other

532
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,200
and I didn't want you to worry about me.

533
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm different from Ling Xiao.

534
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,800
His mother and sister

535
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,480
pester him like two vampires.

536
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,360
Who could sleep well

537
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,680
with some burden like that?

538
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,560
They have their difficulties.

539
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,360
Let's not talk about it since we don't know it well.

540
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,820
Life is hard for everyone.

541
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,380
Then I won't talk about it.

542
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,960
I know there's something on your mind.

543
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,330
So be honest with me.

544
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,880
Do you want

545
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,760
to see your mother

546
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
all these years?

547
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,340
Why do I want to see her?

548
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
She abandoned me.

549
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,770
Your mother is not a bad person.

550
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,800
Life is hard for Chen Ting

551
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,880
and He Mei is not a bad person.

552
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,560
In your eyes,

553
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,440
there's no bad person in this world.

554
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,280
She just knew

555
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,320
that you were such a good man

556
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,000
that you would take in

557
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,320
even the abandoned cat and dog.

558
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,840
What are you talking about?

559
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,770
You're not an abandoned cat or dog.

560
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,120
Neither of you

561
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,280
are abandoned.

562
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,520
Do you have her phone number?

563
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,680
If you really want to see her,

564
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,840
I can get it for you.

565
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,760
Dad, forget it.

566
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
It has been so many years,

567
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,160
and she must have forgotten about us.

568
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,490
Stop worrying about it.

569
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,020
And what can I say to her

570
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,200
right now?

571
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,800
You are my family

572
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,720
and she's just a stranger.

573
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,440
It's hard to say

574
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,680
about who's our family.

575
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,320
You're right.

576
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,930
I shouldn't have said that.

577
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,600
No,

578
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,240
I didn't mean that.

579
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,060
I know what you meant, Dad.

580
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,600
You wanted to say

581
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,020
that nothing is absolute.

582
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,680
I'm not a well-educated man,

583
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,240
so I can't lecture you

584
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,970
about life philosophy,

585
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,650
but after so many years,

586
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,620
I do have some experience, right?

587
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
There's a saying,

588
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,680
"Don't be too hard on yourself."

589
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,520
Things come and things go.

590
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,200
Everything has its time.

591
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,560
I know what you want to say, Dad.

592
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,360
You want to say

593
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,400
that we should let nature

594
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,640
take its course, right?

595
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,200
Yes.

596
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,680
Look,

597
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,600
since we should let nature take its course,

598
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,480
won't you be interfering with it

599
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
if you go and look for her?

600
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,120
You're right.

601
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,360
I used to straighten things out

602
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,080
for you,

603
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,320
but now you're straightening things out

604
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,840
for me.

605
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,440
Dad, I will not only straighten things out for you,

606
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,240
I will also take good care of you.

607
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,560
OK!

608
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,120
Then I'll be just an idler

609
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,280
and let you take care of me.

610
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,940
No problem.

611
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,480
Eat that one.

612
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,800
That one has another kind of filling.

613
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,280
This one?

614
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,720
Yes, try this one.

615
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,640
I've told the driver

616
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
about your situation

617
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
and the driver has checked the orders.

618
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,280
He said that he picked her up at Huaxing Road

619
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,940
and sent her to Guomao Lanhai.

620
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,520
Running helps us secrete dopamine

621
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,480
which makes us feel better.

622
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,480
When we get tired,

623
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,560
we'll go back and take a hot bath

624
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,290
and then go to bed comfortably.

625
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm a doctor.

626
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,120
You don't have to tell me about that.

627
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,480
You are a dentist

628
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,180
and you need to see a doctor when you're sick.

629
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,560
Be my doctor, please.

630
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,340
I can't be a doctor,

631
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,640
but I do know you well.

632
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,320
There's something on your mind

633
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,650
and you have to let it go.

634
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
You're my doctor

635
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,500
and you can help me get better.

636
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,160
That's gross!

637
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,160
I mean it.

638
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,160
I think you've made my bedroom

639
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,490
much more comfortable.

640
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,040
I didn't do it alone.

641
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,420
Mingyue did most of it.

642
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,040
Then who bought the book?

643
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,360
I did.

644
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,280
I like that book.

645
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,200
I think there's something

646
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,260
really great in it.

647
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,760
For example,

648
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,860
"I finally understand

649
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,360
that one can't take care of everything

650
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,320
on their own.

651
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,690
Even the shadow of a white cloud

652
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,920
can be suffocating."

653
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,900
What were you laughing at?

654
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,240
Since our childhood,

655
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,280
you can always help me get better.

656
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,360
Stop it! It's gross!

657
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I need to tell you something serious.

658
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,520
Next Saturday

659
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,360
it's the 21st anniversary of my mother's death.

660
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,120
I know it. Your dad has told me.

661
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,400
It's been 21 years.

662
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
My dad has been widowed for 21 years.

663
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,040
He has spent these years taking care of his children.

664
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,680
I've had a happy childhood,

665
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,580
but it was hard for him.

666
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,280
I really regret it.

667
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,720
I shouldn't have stopped him

668
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,320
from getting married again.

669
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Do you still remember Ziqiu's mother?

670
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,640
Yes.

671
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,840
I saw her just a few times,

672
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,920
and it was always

673
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,580
when she came to pick Ziqiu up.

674
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,560
She's pretty,

675
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,760
a little cold and she doesn't talk much.

676
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,620
Why did you suddenly bring her up?

677
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,160
I think she refused my dad back then

678
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,280
because of me.

679
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,140
Why do you think so?

680
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,680
If my blind date

681
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,320
had such

682
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
a troublesome daughter,

683
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,720
I would have ran away too.

684
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,130
And at that time,

685
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,320
Ziqiu had already called

686
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,400
my father dad,

687
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,740
and she didn't stop it.

688
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,160
I was afraid

689
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,880
that she might abuse me

690
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,160
after getting married with my dad.

691
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,960
And I even cried

692
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,680
in the quilt alone.

693
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,160
I think you hid in the quilt

694
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,290
to have some sweets.

695
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,400
Sweets can make people feel better.

696
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
It's my strategy.

697
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,280
Fine.

698
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
I didn't know why people had to get married

699
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,680
when I was little,

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,480
and I made some mistakes.

701
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,200
Now it's good

702
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,290
since you've come back.

703
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,160
From now on,

704
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,960
the three of us

705
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,090
can be with our dads.

706
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Let's run.

707
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,040
Let's secrete dopamine.

708
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,360
Xiao, hurry up.

709
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,680
Let's secrete dopamine.

710
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Let's run.

711
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,960
Hello, Aunt.

712
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600
I wanted to go and visit you

713
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,530
in the countryside when I got time.

714
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,800
OK, I'll tell my dad about it.

715
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,330
Come and have a dinner here.

716
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,680
No trouble at all.

717
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,730
OK, see you the day after tomorrow.

718
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,160
Goodbye.

719
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,440
Your aunt will come to visit you?

720
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,760
She said that her ducks

721
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,600
got sick,

722
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
so she had to come here to buy some medicine.

723
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,570
And she'll come to see me by the way.

724
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,520
I'm going to take a bath.

725
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:02,960
OK.

726
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Ling Xiao, your phone!

727
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,500
It's from your mother.

728
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,240
You're going back to Singapore?

729
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,850
You've got an appointment.

730
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,640
Coffee for you.

731
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,440
Thank you.

732
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,520
Put it over there, please.

733
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,840
You don't have to be so polite.

734
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,160
We're colleagues.

735
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Do you have time tomorrow night?

736
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,240
Secret Love for the Peach Blossom Spring

737
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
is going to perform here.

738
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm sorry.

739
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,450
I'm going back to Singapore tomorrow.

740
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,940
But you've just come here for a month.

741
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,880
Are you missing the girl that you're in love with?

742
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,340
I'm not being mean,

743
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,639
but it's hard to have a long-distance relationship.

744
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,960
I know

745
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,080
it's hard.

746
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,670
Luckily,

747
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,400
the girl that I'm in love with is right here.

748
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,230
She's here?

749
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,760
Didn't you leave here after high school graduation?

750
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,960
About just that time.

751
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,710
She was your high school schoolmate?

752
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,360
Yes.

753
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,850
Your classmate?

754
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,120
She's two years younger than me.

755
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,840
Xiao, Miss Feng.

756
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,040
Mingyue, you're here.

757
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,280
I came to have my teeth cleaned.

758
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,080
Which doctor?

759
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,190
Dr. Feng Xixi.

760
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,840
It's me.

761
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,360
Would you please

762
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,280
be nicer

763
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,210
to my boyfriend?

764
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm an artist.

765
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,280
What kind of boyfriend

766
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
do you want me to have?

767
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,610
It was not me who brought him up.

768
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Let's talk.

769
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
He likes watching girls,

770
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,600
but he's not obscene.

771
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,240
How to put it?

772
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,520
When I was a kid,

773
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,240
I always held

774
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,400
a sugar jar

775
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,040
and to him, the girls' waists

776
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,170
are like a sugar jar.

777
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,920
Got it?

778
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
You don't need

779
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,120
my permission

780
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,650
to have a boyfriend, do you?

781
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,440
Even so,

782
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,360
I don't want you

783
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,520
to misunderstand him.

784
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,160
There's no misunderstanding.

785
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,400
I just don't like him.

786
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,920
Why?

787
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,580
Never mind.

788
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,970
Open your mouth.

789
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,900
I'll tell you why when I come back.

790
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,690
Where are you going?

791
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,640
Singapore.

792
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
You're going back to Singapore?

793
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,080
I'm not going back. I'm going

794
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,040
to take care of something there.

795
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,880
I'll probably

796
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,740
come back before your mother's death anniversary.

797
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
Lie down and don't move.

798
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,500
It's in the middle of your treatment.

799
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,530
Open your mouth.

800
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,370
Open your mouth.

801
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,120
Are you a schoolmate

802
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,380
of Ling Xiao's sister?

803
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,180
Yes, we were in the same class.

804
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,080
Back then,

805
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,210
Ling Xiao must have been very popular.

806
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,120
Kind of.

807
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,640
He didn't talk much

808
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,420
and no one dared to talk to him.

809
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,600
Was he in love

810
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,460
with someone in your high school?

811
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
Maybe some girl two years younger

812
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,920
than him?

813
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,820
Did Ling Xiao tell you something?

814
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,560
When we were chatting,

815
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,680
he mentioned

816
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,600
that he was in love with a schoolmate

817
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,530
who was two years younger than him.

818
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,330
Two years younger than him?

819
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,920
You don't know it?

820
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,920
I don't know it.

821
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,520
Well, it was a secret love.

822
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,280
Why did he even tell you

823
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,540
about his secret love?

824
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,920
Because we're friends.

825
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,960
We invite each other to dinner and coffee

826
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,560
and sometimes modern drama.

827
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Lie down, please.

828
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,200
Li Jianjian,

829
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,840
who do you think

830
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,600
is Ling Xiao's first love?

831
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,840
A schoolmate

832
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,280
who's two years younger than him.

833
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,210
Who else could it be apart from you?

834
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Are you upset

835
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,920
that your brother is in love with me?

836
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,720
Xiao is going back to Singapore.

837
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,120
Do you know that?

838
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,520
Why is he going back to Singapore?

839
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,760
Didn't he just come back?

840
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,960
He told his mother that he would come back for just a month.

841
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Will he come back?

842
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,080
He said that he would come back this Friday.

843
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,160
Good then. Good then.

844
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Aren't you in love

845
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,960
with Ziqiu?

846
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,360
Can you please

847
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,720
stop embarrassing me?

848
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,740
You're shamed into anger!

849
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,200
Don't think I dare not fight back

850
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
just because you're going to be my sister-in-law!

851
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,660
I'm not in love with your brother!

852
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,900
OK. I'll shut up! I'll shut up!

853
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,720
What would you like to eat for lunch?

854
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,640
My mom wants to see me for lunch.

855
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,040
You go back to the studio.

856
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,980
Why does she want to see you again?

857
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,520
She's going to have a lunch with her friend

858
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,200
and her friend said that it had been a while since she had seen me the last time,

859
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,460
so she wanted to see me.

860
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,720
OK, got it, sister-in-law.

861
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Can't you shut up?

862
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,840
Can't you? Can't you?

863
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,240
Mom, Mrs. Chen.

864
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,160
Mingyue, you're here.

865
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,280
Come. Sit down.

866
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,720
Didn't I ask you

867
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,360
to dress up

868
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,440
before you got out?

869
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
Mrs. Chen watched me grow up.

870
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,320
To meet her is like

871
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,560
to meet my own mother.

872
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,760
Why should I dress up?

873
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,260
Why are we going to have western food?

874
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,400
Don't you like

875
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
Chaoshan hot pot?

876
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,600
You young people

877
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,640
prefer these restaurants

878
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,240
with better environment,

879
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
right?

880
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,540
There's someone else?

881
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,690
Mr. Chen is here too?

882
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes, he went to the bathroom.

883
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,800
But it's not Mr. Chen.

884
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,920
Your mother didn't tell you clearly about this.

885
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,520
Actually, she's...

886
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,200
Let me do it.

887
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,080
Here is the thing.

888
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,520
When I went to

889
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,800
Mrs. Chen's office last time,

890
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,640
I saw

891
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,200
a great young man there.

892
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,600
I've asked about it.

893
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
He's a postgraduate

894
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,360
from a national key university.

895
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,120
Both of his parents

896
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,320
work in institutions

897
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,880
and he doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

898
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,160
You can barely know

899
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,080
any young men

900
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,640
in your office,

901
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,640
so I asked Mrs. Chen

902
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,960
to arrange this dinner

903
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,770
to introduce you to each other.

904
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,600
Mom, why didn't you tell me

905
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,000
it was a blind date?

906
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,560
It's not a blind date.

907
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,840
It's just for you

908
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,170
to meet some new friend.

909
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,360
Didn't you have dinners like this

910
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,760
when you were in college?

911
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,720
Jianyang.

912
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,840
Come, let me introduce to you.

913
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,520
This is Mrs. Qi's daughter,

914
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,240
Qi Mingyue.

915
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,560
Mingyue,

916
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,600
this is Lu Jianyang.

917
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,880
Nice to meet you.

918
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,810
Nice to meet you.

919
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,280
Come. Sit down, please.

920
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,760
Jianyang, have a look at the menu.

921
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,320
Order whatever you like.

922
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,800
Let's order.

923
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,200
Are you going to the bathroom?

924
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,720
Go now.

925
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,200
Mom,

926
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
I have an interview later,

927
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
so I have to go now.

928
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,360
How could you leave

929
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,090
in the middle of our dinner?

930
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,240
Mrs. Chen will be embarrassed

931
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,160
by you.

932
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,200
Mom, please don't do this again.

933
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm just 25 years old.

934
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,880
Do I have to go on blind dates?

935
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,640
When I was at your age,

936
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,960
you were old enough to call me mom.

937
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
If I don't do this for you,

938
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,520
do you think that good young men

939
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,980
will fall from the heaven?

940
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Why didn't you ask me

941
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,880
if I was in love with someone?

942
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,160
OK. Please tell me

943
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,920
if you're in love

944
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,080
with someone.

945
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,920
Yes, I am.

946
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,120
Who is it? Do I know him?

947
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,880
OK. Stop being childish.

948
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,800
I think

949
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,400
this young man is not bad.

950
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,580
He's quite honest.

951
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,400
Friend him on WeChat first.

952
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,600
Anyway I've told all my friends

953
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,320
to look out for you.

954
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,400
There'll be other young men if you don't like this one.

955
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,530
I've already have someone that I like.

956
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,440
OK. Take him home and introduce him to me.

957
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,360
OK, I'll take him home in a couple of days.

958
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,560
Don't look down on me.

959
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,880
OK, I'll wait and see.

960
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,520
Anyway, don't think about

961
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,520
going to work

962
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,650
in Beijing anymore.

963
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
Get well prepared for the civil service examination.

964
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,240
Mom!

965
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
It's settled. Behave yourself now.

966
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
Go to the bathroom now

967
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,480
and come back to the dinner.
