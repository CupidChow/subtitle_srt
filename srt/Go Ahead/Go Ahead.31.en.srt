[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,020
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,980
Episode 31

4
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,840
Do I look gorgeous?

5
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,040
Yes.

6
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,680
You look gorgeous in any dress.

7
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,120
Really?

8
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,720
Well, I'll change another dress

9
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,440
and show it to you.

10
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm too scared to tell her about that.

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm telling her for you.

12
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,320
OK.

13
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,840
Are you thirsty?

14
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,640
Yes.

15
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,880
Do we have beer at home?

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,640
Yes.

17
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
You're being too nervous.

18
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
How about now? Are you feeling better?

19
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes.

20
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,840
How about this dress?

21
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
How many dresses have you bought?

22
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
I've just bought three.

23
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
A 40 percent off is given to the out-of-season dresses of this brand.

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,360
This dress costs 1,300 yuan only.

25
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,720
Nice.

26
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
We can see it's nice from its price.

27
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
For the meeting with the crew,

28
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,200
I should be elegant and dignified in a gorgeous dress,

29
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
not a cheap one.

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,600
Besides, this time

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,880
it's not the assistant director I'm meeting,

32
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,680
but the director and the producer

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,079
that will provide me the audition personally.

34
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,360
Moreover, Sun Li is the leading heroine.

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
Gosh,

36
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,160
it's my dream to work with her.

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
Sun Li is excellent.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
That's amazing.

39
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,240
I'll change another dress

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,120
and show it to you.

41
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,080
Wait,

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,680
hold on.

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Don't get changed.

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Mingyue wants to talk with you.

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
You said you would help me to tell her, didn't you?

46
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,200
I didn't say that.

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
You did.

48
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,120
I didn't.

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,120
Tell her about that yourself.

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
What's up? Tell me.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,360
Don't be annoyed with me if I tell you.

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
That's it?

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
I knew it a few days ago.

54
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,760
I saw him make a picture of you

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,480
as his mobile wallpaper.

56
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,760
I didn't give him any picture.

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,000
I know, stay calm.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,120
I've already told you that.

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I've already told him that we will still be friends

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
once we meet in the future.

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,160
I just had

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
a little crush on him

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,320
under that circumstance.

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,720
Since I'm about to shoot a play soon,

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
I will have no time for a relationship.

66
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,320
I need to focus on my career.

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm glad you are not annoyed.

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Why do I have to be annoyed?

69
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,800
There's nothing between him and me.

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
You thought he was a nice guy,

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
didn't you?

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Would you like a try?

73
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Don't ever think of Ling Xiao.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm not thinking of him.

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Li Jianjian,

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,280
just have your watermelon.

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
Why do you stab it?

78
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
Why are you annoyed with me?

79
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm just an outsider.

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
The man I like likes Mingyue,

81
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,000
while the one Mingyue likes

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
likes Li Jianjian.

83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,640
So I'm

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,480
the most pathetic here.

85
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,960
Not really.

86
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,280
So you rejected him directly?

87
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,520
What happened then?

88
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,480
Then I deleted

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,800
his Wechat account

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,840
and phone number.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,480
I will no longer meet him

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
in the future.

93
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,080
Is it necessary to do so?

94
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,840
Of course.

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,160
You don't need to do so

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
even if you dislike him.

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,320
You can just stay away from him.

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
Besides, it's nice that someone likes you,

99
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,840
isn't it?

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Cut it out.

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
I do hate

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,040
someone chasing me.

103
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm going back to my room, cut it out.

104
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Mingyue is not talented

105
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,320
in managing a relationship, right?

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
Keep stabbing your watermelon.

107
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,520
So your mom

108
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,440
had another son later,

109
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,320
and your dad had another son too.

110
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,680
They don't have anything to do with me.

112
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
I always thought

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,600
you were a stingy guy

115
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,280
born with a silver spoon.

116
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,160
He Ziqiu,

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,760
you are my best friend,

118
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
and I'd like to share all worries with you,

119
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,120
but how about you?

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
You never share anything with me

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,440
but keep it in your mind.

122
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Do you still treat me as your friend?

123
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
You are my best friend, anyway.

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,040
However, I'm a man

125
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
of dignity.

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,200
I think it's a shame of me

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,360
being abandoned.

128
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,640
A shame?

129
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,760
I should be the one

130
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,320
who feels it a shame.

131
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,000
A girl declined me.

132
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,040
I can't be friends with her.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,680
And she even deleted my Wechat account.

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,640
Well, will you keep chasing her?

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know.

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,080
What about you?

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,080
That's all for your mom and you?

138
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,320
I think I'm living a good life now.

139
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
My dad is right.

140
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
Life hasn't been easy for her,

141
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,800
and she isn't a bad guy.

142
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
Li Jianjian is right too.

143
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,880
At least she didn't insist on recognizing me as her son

144
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
so that I can take care of her when she's old.

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,560
Besides, she called Zhao Huaguang

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,320
and scolded him for me.

147
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
She's done everything she could.

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,520
I think it's time for me

149
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,520
to let it go and move on.

150
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Is this exactly what you think?

151
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,360
I think I'm living a good life now,

152
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,030
so you...

153
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,909
You don't need to pity me.

154
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,030
I don't.

155
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,120
You'd better not.

156
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,640
Move on, man.

157
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,920
What's wrong with you, Mingyue?

158
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm fine.

159
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,760
I didn't sleep well last night.

160
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,040
By the way,

161
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
I met Zhuang Bei last night.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
You blacklisted him?

163
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
Don't mention him.

164
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
You are so annoyed with him?

165
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,360
I thought he was a nice guy,

166
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,280
but how could he do this?

167
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,720
That's annoying.

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,960
He likes you.

169
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,360
Cut it out.

170
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,880
Could you do me a favor, Ziqiu?

171
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,480
Go ahead.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
Tell him

173
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,240
that we don't match,

174
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,640
and don't come to see me anymore.

175
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,640
Zhuang Bei is really pathetic.

176
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,800
Please.

177
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,520
What he did

178
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
made me really uncomfortable.

179
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,840
OK, I got it.

180
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,640
Have a steamed bun, Ziqiu.

181
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't give me

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,680
more steam buns.

183
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,920
I've eaten six.

184
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
But this steamed bun is small.

185
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
Not just the buns,

186
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,520
could you stop sending

187
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,000
a barrage of Wechat messages today?

188
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm fine.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm in a good mood. I'm OK.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,440
That's not a barrage of messages.

191
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
I just wanted to know what you were doing

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,160
so I sent you funny videos.

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
Thanks, but I don't need that.

194
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,520
All right.

195
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,640
You can send videos,

196
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
but you should send me the funniest one.

197
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I don't want the ordinary ones.

198
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,240
OK.

199
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,280
OK, OK.

200
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,840
One more, Ziqiu.

201
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,560
Seriously?

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,920
How do I look?

203
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
You look gorgeous!

204
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,440
You look like a star

205
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,280
attending an activity.

206
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,440
Well, will the director and the producer

207
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
think I'm just

208
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,760
an eye candy

209
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,040
without acting talent?

210
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,160
Besides, I didn't have a good performance

211
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,440
in the audition video last time.

212
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,080
You're auditioning for the role of a beauty, right?

213
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,640
A beautiful girl from a wealthy family.

214
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,160
That will work.

215
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,360
Dressing like this is absolutely the right choice.

216
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,480
Yes. Yes.

217
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,480
You do look like a girl from a wealthy family.

218
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,840
Yeah, this fits my role.

219
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,240
Enough, come and have breakfast.

220
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,320
Your audition is at 10 o'clock, isn't it?

221
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
I won't have breakfast.

222
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
I have to get prepared now.

223
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
This time I'll definitely make it.

224
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,520
I want to prove myself.

225
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,480
Keep going. You can make it.

226
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,400
Tang Can.

227
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,080
One more, Ziqiu.

228
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
Please wait here for a moment.

229
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,400
OK.

230
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,640
Good morning, Director. My name is Tang Can.

231
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
I'm 26 years old.

232
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Mom!

233
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,960
What's so hurry?

234
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,360
Get in.

235
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,760
What's up?

236
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
You wouldn't have come so soon

237
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,920
if I didn't say I was in a hurry.

238
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,480
You scared me.

239
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,920
I thought something had happened to you.

240
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,480
I was just kidding.

241
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
There's something good.

242
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,040
What is it?

243
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,680
There's a new building

244
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,320
opposite to our community.

245
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,800
It's a top-grade community

246
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
with excellent facilities.

247
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,440
The point is that it's in the catchment area.

248
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,480
Let me show it to you.

249
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,360
This is it.

250
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,600
I think

251
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,920
this 85-square-meter flat with two rooms

252
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,640
is particularly good.

253
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,160
It's big enough for you and your family

254
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,040
when you get married

255
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,840
and have a child in the future.

256
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
Mom, it hasn't been long since I graduated from university.

257
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,360
I have no money to buy a flat.

258
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,320
It will be long

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
before you buy a flat.

260
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,400
I've discussed this with your dad.

261
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,520
We will pay

262
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,600
50% of the money for you.

263
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,600
I only earn a few thousand yuan a month,

264
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,320
I have no money to repay the loan.

265
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
The money you've earned over the two years

266
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,920
is not enough to repay the loan,

267
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
but I'll repay it for you.

268
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,760
When you have a raise in your salary

269
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,680
after changing a job,

270
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,240
you can repay the loan.

271
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,480
Come to think of it, you have to pay

272
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,880
for the apartment you rent outside.

273
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,400
It's better for you to repay the flat loan

274
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
with the money you pay for the rent.

275
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
Anyway you don't need to worry about money.

276
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
Just give me

277
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
your household register page.

278
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
Maybe you need to be there

279
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,280
when we go through the bank loan formalities.

280
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
As for the rest, you don't need to worry.

281
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
I'll help you fix everything.

282
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,680
I don't need a flat, Mom.

283
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,520
Don't buy it for me.

284
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,440
No, I'll buy it for you.

285
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,080
I've even paid the deposit.

286
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,440
It is 200,000 yuan and won't be returned.

287
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

288
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,280
You are busy, aren't you?

289
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
Besides, this is a good thing.

290
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
I wanted to give you a surprise.

291
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
What I did was for your sake.

292
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,120
I bought you a flat,

293
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
but you are annoyed with me.

294
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm not angry with you.

295
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I just think there's too much pressure on me.

296
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
You bought me a flat

297
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,760
with the money you'd saved for your retired life.

298
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,880
I know you're a good girl

299
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,320
caring about us.

300
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,880
But it doesn't matter.

301
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,480
We aren't old and can still work.

302
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,560
There's so much pressure

303
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,600
on your generation.

304
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,720
With a flat,

305
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
a girl will be respected in her husband's family.

306
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,600
Take it and read it carefully when you go back home.

307
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,800
200,000 yuan.

308
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,720
It's the annual salary

309
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,480
of your dad.

310
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,640
What's up?

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,320
Is it work?

312
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
Well, get back quickly.

313
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,600
By the way, don't forget to study however busy you are.

314
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Go back quickly.

315
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,680
I also need to go back now.

316
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,280
Hurry up.

317
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
Hello, who's that?

318
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
It's me, Mingyue.

319
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm calling with another person's phone.

320
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Well,

321
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,440
I'm outside your building now.

322
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
Could you come out?

323
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,320
I'd like to make things clear to you.

324
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,640
I saw you.

325
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,360
OK.

326
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,600
Thank you.

327
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,280
You're welcome.

328
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm sorry for coming to see you

329
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,280
on such a short notice.

330
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,640
I just…

331
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,120
don't want us

332
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
to come to such a bad end.

333
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,960
You know, you even blacklisted me.

334
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,600
Things don't have to go like this for us.

335
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
If you dislike me, it doesn't matter. I'm serious.

336
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
He Ziqiu didn't tell you that?

337
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
I don't like you at all.

338
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
Once you come to my mind,

339
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,880
I feel uncomfortable.

340
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,960
You make me uncomfortable. I'm serious.

341
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
Please don't chase me anymore.

342
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I'm so sorry.

343
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,920
We were having

344
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
a teleconference just now.

345
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,680
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

346
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,480
That's OK.

347
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm the producer of this play.

348
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,120
Hello.

349
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,120
This is our director.

350
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,520
Hello, Director.

351
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,080
Hello.

352
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,120
Take a seat.

353
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,360
OK, take a seat.

354
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,600
Here, Director.

355
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,880
Tang Can?

356
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,440
Give us an introduction

357
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
about yourself.

358
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,920
OK. My name is Tang Can.

359
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm 26 years old.

360
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,480
It's been two years since I shot a play last time,

361
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,960
but I've been having auditions.

362
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,880
However, no role

363
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
fit for me.

364
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
I can take any roles that are challenging,

365
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
and I have an understanding of many industries.

366
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,000
I can go to experience life

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,640
if necessary.

368
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,520
Besides, I was a bit nervous

369
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,760
in the audition video.

370
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,120
It might not look good.

371
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,600
I was too nervous.

372
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
But I can take the audition on the spot.

373
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
Audition is not needed.

374
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,200
We both have watched the plays you shot.

375
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,720
Yes.

376
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Since you used to be a child star,

377
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,320
so there's absolutely no problem in your acting skills.

378
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,000
Besides, you look good.

379
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,680
Thank you, Director.

380
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,240
After seeing you,

381
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,069
I think you are better than I've thought.

382
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,310
However, would you please stand up

383
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,560
and let us take a look

384
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
at your side and your back?

385
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,640
No problem.

386
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,000
Let me take a look at your back.

387
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,560
I think this back looks like hers.

388
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,109
It's just right.

389
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,160
Ask her height.

390
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,200
What's your height?

391
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,310
5 feet 5 inches.

392
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,360
It's just right.

393
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,200
Her height is the same as hers too.

394
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,120
That's all, thank you.

395
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,880
Please sit down.

396
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,480
You said you are willing

397
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,000
to take roles that are challenging,

398
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,560
right?

399
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,960
Yes, besides Li Tianna,

400
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
I can also play Song Xiaoping

401
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,200
and Fang Shanshan.

402
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,280
I can audition for the two roles.

403
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,520
Well,

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,360
do you like Sun Li?

405
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,040
I've been looking forward to working with her.

406
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,400
Now here's a chance for you

407
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,680
to work with her.

408
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
Sun Li has a waist injury.

409
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,960
There are many fighting scenes

410
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,760
in our play

411
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
which depicts the fall of a martial arts family.

412
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,400
Sun Li wants to shoot the fighting scenes herself,

413
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
but there are many actions

414
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,720
she cannot do.

415
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,880
So we need a girl

416
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
whose height and figure

417
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,880
are identical to hers

418
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,840
to do these actions for her.

419
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
Besides, Sun Li herself

420
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
thought you look like her

421
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,120
after seeing your photo.

422
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,080
Of course, with your personal condition,

423
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,000
acting as a stand-in

424
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,360
is more than enough for you.

425
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,840
However,

426
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,920
if you accept

427
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,560
our invitation,

428
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,080
we will definitely give you priority

429
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,960
for our next play.

430
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,600
Exactly.

431
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
You can go back and think about this

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
before giving us a reply.

433
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,320
In my opinion,

434
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,080
Can should continue to be an actress.

435
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,280
You know, when she was a little girl,

436
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
she earned a lot

437
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
by acting in TV dramas and commercials.

438
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
Many people admired her.

439
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
If you hadn't started

440
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,440
that Taobao errand services

441
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
for your superstar dream,

442
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,240
I wouldn't have had

443
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,200
to lie to our relatives and friends

444
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,120
like that.

445
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,400
You think I'm not afraid we'll be exposed?

446
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,040
This is a shame.

447
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,200
Your mom did this for your own sake, Can.

448
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,960
Just listen to her.

449
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
You are great in everything,

450
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm serious,

451
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,960
but I've already got someone I like.

452
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,960
What does the girl you like

453
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,880
look like?

454
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,440
She's quiet, graceful

455
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,440
liberal and dignified,

456
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
working from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon.

457
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,320
We need a girl

458
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,680
whose height and figure

459
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
are identical to hers

460
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,520
to do these actions for her.

461
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,560
Hello, here are the shoes you want.

462
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,520
Thank you.

463
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,560
Hello.

464
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,200
Hello.

465
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,080
Do you have a pair of these in Size 43?

466
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
No, we don't have any in our store,

467
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,640
but we can have them delivered

468
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,080
from another store.

469
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,320
Well, do you have any pair in other colors here?

470
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,480
There's a black pair.

471
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,320
May I have a look at it?

472
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
Sure, please wait a second.

473
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,600
Thank you.

474
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,120
For whom do you buy the shoes?

475
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,720
Ling Xiao.

476
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
His birthday is coming soon.

477
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
The shoes I gifted him during our high-school days

478
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,720
have almost worn out.

479
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,760
So you buy the shoes for your boyfriend.

480
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,080
Boss, that pair is the basic edition.

481
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,760
Many people wear it out there.

482
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,680
You should buy the limited edition.

483
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
Shut up.

484
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,440
Have you finished trying the shoes?

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
The noon break will be over soon.

486
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,200
OK.

487
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,840
Come and take a look, Juan.

488
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,440
Come on.

489
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,600
Hello,

490
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
this is the black pair you want.

491
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,680
Do you have a pair in Size 42?

492
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,320
We have a pair of these in Size 42.

493
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,280
OK,

494
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,760
I'd like a pair of these in Size 42,

495
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,320
and a blue pair of those

496
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,200
in Size 43.

497
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,320
Could you deliver them

498
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,440
to the address I give you?

499
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,400
OK, no problem.

500
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,520
Thanks. Well, I'd like to pay the bill.

501
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,040
OK, please wait a minute.

502
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,520
Mingyue?

503
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Shall we meet in the afternoon?

504
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,520
Sure.

505
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,280
Both of you look unhappy.

506
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,520
What happened?

507
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Can,

508
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,320
your audition didn't go well?

509
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,680
Yes,

510
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
but it was different from what I'd thought.

511
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,600
They were interested in me

512
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,480
and wanted me to be a stand-in for Sun Li.

513
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,120
I could receive invitations

514
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
from a dozen of plays in the past,

515
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,840
but now I can only be a stand-in.

516
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,840
That's over the top.

517
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
It's not.

518
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,000
They didn't force me to do this after all.

519
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
Whether I accept it or not is up to me.

520
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,040
If you want to cry, just go ahead. Don't hold it.

521
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080
Maybe it is a big blow for me.

522
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,960
I don't want to cry now.

523
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
What about you?

524
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,240
Why did you, an outstanding employee

525
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
skip work?

526
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,960
Today my mom told me

527
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,640
the flats in the building

528
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,560
opposite to the community we live in go on sale.

529
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,240
She wants to apply for a mortgage to buy a flat for me.

530
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,440
If so,

531
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,760
our family will be entirely hollowed out

532
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,880
We have to repay over 10,000 yuan of the loan every month.

533
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,840
In the next 30 years,

534
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,760
it will cost us over 10,000 yuan to repay the loan every month.

535
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,440
What if my parents

536
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,400
get serious diseases?

537
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,440
What if something bad

538
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,520
happens to my family?

539
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,160
Our family will be entirely in financial difficulties.

540
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,200
Then ask your mom

541
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,320
not to buy the flat.

542
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,800
She's paid 200,000 yuan as the deposit,

543
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
and it can't be returned.

544
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,440
This is her way of doing things.

545
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,920
Now I think I'm trapped

546
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,640
in a cocoon.

547
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,200
Your mom makes every silk,

548
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
but you never break it.

549
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,560
As time goes by,

550
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,680
you are trapped and can never get out.

551
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,920
I have no right

552
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,560
to talk about your mom,

553
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,200
but if the cocoon

554
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,480
is broken,

555
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,080
the worm inside will transform into a butterfly.

556
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,720
Transforming into a butterfly is not that easy.

557
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
What can become a butterfly

558
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,240
is proved to be one itself.

559
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm no more than

560
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,840
an ordinary worm.

561
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,840
I'm an ordinary worm, too,

562
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,520
a larva which looks like a butterfly.

563
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,040
The only real butterfly

564
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
is Li Jianjian.

565
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm not a butterfly.

566
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
I just look like a butterfly.

567
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,040
I'm no more than a moth

568
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
which falls down

569
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,600
when flying to the light.

570
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,120
Nasty.

571
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
When I was in high school,

572
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I thought all roads

573
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,120
I'd like to take

574
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,040
could lead to Rome.

575
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,000
But now

576
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I've found

577
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,160
on every road to Rome, a sign is posted, saying

578
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,880
"No exit".

579
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,680
There's an exit for me.

580
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,240
I can just

581
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
follow my mom

582
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
and take the roads that she's taken .

583
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,840
Your mom thinks too much.

584
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,440
She thinks more than my mom. That makes her more tired.

585
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
I know she works particularly hard.

586
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
She focuses her mind

587
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
on my dad and me in her lifetime.

588
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
She thinks that her career in her lifetime

589
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,920
is just about my dad and me.

590
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,000
As long as she takes good care of the two of us,

591
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,280
her career is successful.

592
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,920
In that case,

593
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,720
my father also focuses his mind on me only.

594
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,760
Things cannot go on like this.

595
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
We've already passed 25.

596
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
We aren't teenagers anymore.

597
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,920
According to my mom,

598
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,560
she already started

599
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
making money

600
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,560
to support her family at this age.

601
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,480
Exactly. Things cannot go on like this,

602
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
or we will be trapped

603
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
in this cocoon forever.

604
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
Whether we will be worms, moths or butterflies,

605
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,360
let's get out of the cocoon first.

606
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,320
Yeah, let's get out.

607
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,040
Get out.

608
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
What's wrong, baby?

609
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,280
Why are you weeping?

610
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,280
It occurs to me that once I went back home,

611
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,120
I saw my dad

612
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,240
peeling the garlic,

613
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,400
so I tried to tease him.

614
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,240
I wanted to play a joke with him.

615
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,800
So I sent him a Wechat message,

616
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,880
asking him what he was doing.

617
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
Then he took out his reading glasses

618
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,560
and replied to me

619
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,080
typing like this.

620
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,080
It took him two minutes to send just one sentence.

621
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,880
That's because

622
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
I asked him

623
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,040
to send me text messages

624
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,960
not voice messages.

625
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,320
At that moment, I felt

626
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,120
my dad is old.

627
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,640
They've finished all the work.

628
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,520
I'm watching TV.

629
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,760
♫Thinking of the first time♫

630
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,160

♫You held me so tight♫

634
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,040

don't send me text messages in the future.

Come on, give me a hug.

657
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,240
Get up, baby.

658
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,200
I feel numb in my legs.

659
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,960
I feel numb in my legs.

660
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,960
Don't touch them.

661
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,000
The food in this restaurant tastes so nice.

662
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,440
No wonder it is ranked the first

663
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,360
among the Spanish restaurants in this city.

664
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
Indeed the food tastes nice.

665
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,240
When I saw the prices,

666
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,400
I found it tasty.

667
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
It cost over 1,000 yuan.

668
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,240
It's no big deal.

669
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
I could afford

670
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
this dinner.

671
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,640
Thank you, Miss Li.

672
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,400
Who bought such a big box of things?

673
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
It is from my dad,

674
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,760
and Ziqiu carried it here in the morning.

675
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,600
What's inside?

676
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Here you are.

677
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,760
I don't know.

678
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,280
I'll open it.

679
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,360
It's food.

680
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,320
What's this?

681
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
Swimming crabs.

682
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,120
They look tasty.

683
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,880
What else are there?

684
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,640
I can eat

685
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,240
your mom's pickled radish again

686
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,760
in my lifetime.

687
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,200
Abalones, sea worm jelly.

688
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,520
It tastes exactly like what I had.

689
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,240
Well, the two of you deal with them.

690
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
I'm giving my dad a call.

691
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Say thanks to your mom in our place.

692
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm helping you with it.

693
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,000
Leave it to me.

694
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,960
You'd better

695
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
call your dad immediately

696
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,560
and deal with the issue of the flat.

697
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Talk with her properly.

698
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,840
Good girl.

699
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,720
Hello?

700
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,680
Can, have you had your dinner?

701
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Yes.

702
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
I've received the package, Dad.

703
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,440
Your mom

704
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,800
misses you every day,

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,360
but she never

706
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,600
says that.

707
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,440
You see,

708
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,480
all the food she's made is your favorite.

709
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,880
She felt embarrassed to take it to you,

710
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,560
so she had it delivered to you.

711
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,640
Is she feeling better?

712
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,120
Did she go to the hospital

713
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
to check her headache she mentioned?

714
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,920
She didn't.

715
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,360
She said she had searched it on the Internet

716
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,200
and found that she had a neural headache,

717
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
so she just needed to take some pills.

718
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,200
Diagnosing her illness herself?

719
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,520
Who did she think she is , a doctor?

720
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
What if she has cancer in her brain?

721
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,680
Can't you say something good?

722
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,360
Cancer?

723
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
I had this headache just because of you.

724
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
If you want to talk with Can, talk properly.

725
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,960
You'd better go to see the doctor in the hospital.

726
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,480
Your mom is not eavesdropping on you. She's gone.

727
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,880
Everything goes on well here.

728
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,760
If you want to eat something,

729
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,720
just call me

730
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,280
and I'll ask your mom to make it for you.

731
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,320
Dad.

732
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,800
Well,

733
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,760
can I still go

734
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,160
and do the job in the museum

735
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,400
you mentioned last time?

736
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,880
What? You didn't agree to that?

737
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,880
I was on business in Fuzhou.

738
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Your mom called me

739
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,000
talking about buying a flat.

740
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,080
I told her to talk about this when I go back.

741
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,520
But she's paid 200,000 yuan

742
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,760
as the deposit.

743
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
How could your mom...

744
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,680
Why didn't she discuss this with me?

745
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Don't worry, Dad.

746
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,080
If Mom wanted to apply for a mortgage,

747
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,480
she would definitely need my ID card,

748
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,160
and me to go to the bank

749
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,880
to go through the joint repayment formalities.

750
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,680
Since you didn't agree to it,

751
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
things would be easy.

752
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,240
I asked a friend of mine

753
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
who sells flats.

754
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,120
He said the deposit

755
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
could be transferred to another person

756
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,280
since it cannot be returned.

757
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,720
Don't give your household register page

758
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,800
to your mom.

759
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,560
I'll be back in a few days.

760
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,280
Let's talk about this when I'm back, OK?

761
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,120
OK.

762
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Take care of yourself out there, Dad.

763
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
Got it. Goodbye.

764
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,080
♫Light is hidden in the night by the sunset♫

765
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
I have wrinkles.

766
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,760
♫But the sleepless stars dismantle the darkness♫

767
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,960
♫The night sky won't be dark♫

768
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,160
♫As long as♫

769
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,080
♫the moonlight shines through the chinks♫

770
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,080
♫If you ask the night sky♫

771
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,920
♫About the twists and turns before dawn♫

772
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,120
♫It's just the past which will be gone tomorrow♫

773
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,760
♫So silence requires♫

774
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,600
♫Not too much talk♫

775
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,680
♫It just bears with everything♫

776
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,760
♫Looking back in despair every time♫

777
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,360
♫Having disheartened thoughts every time♫

♫It surges♫

779
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,720
♫How similar the night sky is to me♫

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,280
♫It has the unyielding colors♫

781
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,680
You've had half a bowl

782
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,520
of the pickled radish. It's late at night.

783
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,520
Three more bars, and I will stop eating.

784
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,960
No.

785
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
Try it. It tastes nice.

786
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,000
I'll put it away.

787
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,320
Don't do that. There are three bars left.

788
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,160
Everybody,

789
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
come and throw something away for me.

790
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
What is that?

791
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,240
Useless clothes.

792
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,480
Fortunately I didn't throw these woven bags away

793
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
when I moved in.

794
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,640
They were almost not enough.

795
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,360
Come on!

796
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,880
That's all.

797
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,080
You want to throw them all?

798
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,040
I won't provide Taobao errand services,

799
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,960
and I've officially given up working as an actress.

800
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,600
I called my dad.

801
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
Tomorrow I'll go to the museum

802
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,400
for an interview for the guide,

803
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,920
so I don't need so many clothes here.

804
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,920
You won't work as an actress? Seriously?

805
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,120
I'm already 26.

806
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,840
Forget it.

807
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,320
It's time to do something for my own sake.

808
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,630
Fortunately, I shot ads

809
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,560
in my childhood

810
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,840
and bought two flats for my family.

811
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
There's no pressure on me

812
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,440
to support myself in the future.

813
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,280
Well, you should think about this carefully.

814
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,280
Actually I've been thinking about this,

815
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,190
and I finally figured it out

816
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,630
that I have no such luck to be popular.

817
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
So this should be the end of it.

818
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,760
Forget it.

819
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,190
Today I heard Jianjian say

820
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,280
that her dad is getting old,

821
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,710
Come to think of it,

822
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,120
my parents are no longer young either.

823
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,720
Since I can't make a great fortune,

824
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
I should take care of myself

825
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,920
and not make them worry about me.

826
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,600
That's how I perform my filial duty.

827
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,240
What are you waiting for? Let's move them away.

828
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,440
Come on.

829
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,400
I'll call Ling Xiao and Ziqiu for help.

830
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,000
Yep.

831
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,200
Right.

832
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,680
Being single for long makes us stupid.

833
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,160
We have men.

834
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,800
If you feel regretful,

835
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,960
I can carry those bags back for you.

836
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,440
After all, these have cost you lots of money.

837
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,720
Can is amazing.

838
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,720
I thought she would carry the bags back.

839
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,920
Yeah,

840
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,840
these clothes are quite precious to her.

841
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,560
Not really.

842
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,560
Since she throws these clothes away,

843
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,640
she will have an excuse to buy new ones.

844
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,160
Out with the old, in with the new.

845
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,880
Come on.

846
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
Hello, welcome to our restaurant.

847
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,840
Easy.

848
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,160
Here, your fish-ball noodles.

849
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,840
OK, thanks.

850
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,680
Bon appetite.

851
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,560
Haichao.

852
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,480
Mrs. Zhang.

853
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,720
Your work is done?

854
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,880
Have you had breakfast?

855
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,640
Yes.

856
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,000
Take a seat and have some tea.

857
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,400
OK.

858
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,280
Well, Haichao,

859
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,360
my second son

860
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,880
loves dumplings a lot,

861
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,040
but I'm not good at making them.

862
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,480
So I learnt to make some dumplings

863
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,800
from a video.

864
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,360
Since you are an expert in cooking,

865
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,520
could you try the dumplings for me?

866
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,120
I don't need to try them.

867
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,960
Trying them yourself is the best.

868
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,760
I can't tell. You are an expert.

869
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,560
Come on, try them for me.

870
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:06,920
I...

871
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,480
Try one.

872
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,040
How does it taste?

873
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:20,920
Yummy.

874
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,200
Yummy?

875
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,000
Great.

876
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,400
If so, please eat one more.

877
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,800
One more. One more.

878
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,720
I had a lot for breakfast.

879
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,400
Having one more won't make a difference.

880
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
Have you had breakfast, Heping?

881
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,680
I have dumplings here.

882
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,680
I've had it.

883
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,840
You made these dumplings

884
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,920
specially for Haichao, didn't you?

885
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
Enjoy them, Haichao.

886
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,560
Ling Heping!

887
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,240
I understand. I completely understand.

888
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
You are in love.

889
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,600
Come on, Heping.

890
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,280
We are good friends.

891
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,000
We are friends.

892
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Good friends, I understand.

893
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
I won't bother you.

894
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,880
I'll just ask one question and leave right now.

895
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,600
How about I bring something back at noon?

896
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,720
No, thanks.

897
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,360
I'll go to the supermarket and get everything ready.

898
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,080
Well, I'll be back as early as possible.

899
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,760
Carry on.

900
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,960
You are leaving, Heping?

901
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,400
Have some dumplings first.

902
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,320
Carry on feeding him.

903
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,840
Just go.

904
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
See you, Heping.

905
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,360
Feed him.

906
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,560
See you.

907
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,120
Don't take him seriously. He's joking!

908
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,240
It's OK.

909
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,120
Are you busy at noon, Haichao?

910
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,320
No.

911
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,240
But my children said

912
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
they will be back for dinner.

913
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,480
I have to get prepared later.

914
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,440
I happen to be free today.

915
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,320
Let me give you a hand.

916
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,800
Come on.

917
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,600
I'll give you a hand, come on.

918
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,440
No, thanks. I don't need your help.

919
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,680
Thank you all the same.

920
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,400
Take a seat, and have some tea.

921
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,560
Come on.

922
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,760
Is it yummy, Haichao?

923
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,880
Have one more.

924
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,760
I made you these dumplings myself.

925
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,360
It was not like this.

926
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,400
Cut it out. It was not like this.

927
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,400
Keeping this relationship from me,

928
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,200
he told me they were just friends, good friends.

929
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,080
Have you ever seen good friends

930
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,360
feeding each other?

931
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,120
Mr. Ling,

932
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,400
if you feel envious

933
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,960
that my dad has a friend like this,

934
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,600
you can find one too.

935
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,640
I feel envious of him?

936
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm just jealous of him.

937
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,920
He's not married yet, but he conceals this from me.

938
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't have to conceal this from you.

939
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,680
We are just ordinary friends.

940
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,640
You see, there he goes again.

941
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Ordinary friends?

942
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,960
Ordinary friends feeding each other?

943
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,840
Ordinary friends.

944
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,720
Ordinary friends.

945
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:38,760
Mrs. Zhang and I don't match.

946
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,360
Mrs. Zhang and I don't match.

947
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,880
Why?

948
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
Your personality and hers are complementary to each other.

949
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,600
No, that's not proper.

950
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,800
Mrs. Zhang is full of energy.

951
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,520
I mean, she's too lively

952
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,240
and excessively enthusiastic. I don't like that.

953
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,200
Well, being enthusiastic is nice.

954
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,600
Enthusiasm is necessary for love. Without enthusiasm

955
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,200
there won't be love, will there?

956
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,000
What are you talking about?

957
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,800
Love doesn't belong to people at our age.

958
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm telling you,

959
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,760
having the same likes and dislikes is good enough.

960
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,120
What's wrong with people at your age?

961
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,480
Why can't you fall in love at this age?

962
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,360
Exactly.

963
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,160
Mrs. Zhang

964
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,840
was just like

965
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,120
a girl falling in love for the first time,

966
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,640
when looking at you...

967
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,520
Enough, she can cast her loving eyes,

968
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,720
but I can't repay those back.

969
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,320
I shouldn't waste her time.

970
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,720
Let her find a proper man

971
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,080
to cast

972
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,200
her loving eyes on.

973
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,880
Well, well.

974
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,840
He's embarrassed.

975
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,040
Enough, stop teasing Mr. Li.

976
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,320
If Mr. Li thinks they don't match,

977
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,920
just forget it.

978
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,040
I think Mrs. Zhang

979
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,080
looks quite overbearing

980
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,760
and forward.

981
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm afraid Mr. Li might be bullied

982
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,400
if he's with her.

983
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,560
Exactly.

984
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
How overbearing can she be?

985
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Besides, who can bully him?

986
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,360
Mr. Ling,

987
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm afraid you might have forgotten Aunt Chen Ting.

988
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Forget it. Forget it.

989
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,640
I think you should forget it.

990
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,480
Forget it.

991
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
I think you should find

992
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,280
a woman who's tender.

993
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,520
So that

994
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,080
I can come here for meals.

995
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
So, getting along with me during these years,

996
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,800
you just want to have meals here?

997
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,920
What else do you think I want from you?

998
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Well, I won't make you starve.

999
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,280
Just go to my noodle restaurant.

1000
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,360
Stuff yourself with noodles three meals a day.

1001
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,800
You see how heartless he is?

1002
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
He is not married yet, but tries to get rid of me.

1003
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
See how bad he is.

1004
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
Enough, stop arguing.

1005
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,760
Ling Xiao's birthday is coming soon,

1006
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,680
you remember that?

1007
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,360
Of course I remember.

1008
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,120
I've changed my shift with my colleague.

1009
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,720
Your dad and I

1010
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,680
will cook for you guys then.

1011
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,200
OK.

1012
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,280
Making a cake

1013
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,120
is my obligation.

1014
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,880
Of course.

1015
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,600
Well, what will you do, Jianjian?

1016
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,000
Eat.

1017
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,240
You are only good for eating.

1018
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
You'll wait and eat?

1019
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,720
What a little glutton you are!

1020
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,800
I'll also feed Ling Xiao.
