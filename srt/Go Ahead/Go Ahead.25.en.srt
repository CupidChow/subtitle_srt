2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 25

4
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,640
You've always been

5
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,160
in a bad mood lately.

6
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,360
Is it

7
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,660
because I don't want you to go to Beijing?

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
Go to Beijing?

9
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
Why?

10
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,800
I talked to you about that the other day.

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,860
You didn't listen?

12
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm old and got forgetful.

13
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,960
Your daughter

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,960
wanted to work in Beijing for two years.

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,720
I disagreed.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,600
I think she should

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,040
quit her current job

18
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,720
and try to be a civil servant.

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,360
How great it would be to be a civil servant!

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,480
It'll give you security and lots of perks.

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,200
Look. Move back in with us

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,480
and prepare for

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,440
the civil servant exams.

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,000
Stop hanging around

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
with Tang Can.

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,480
Your mind is becoming wild.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,720
Mom, that won't do.

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,360
Back then, Li Jianjian moved out of home

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,920
because of Tang Can and me.

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,079
After you get married,

31
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,160
will you still live together?

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,640
But...

33
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
Anyway, I can't move back in with you now.

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,680
Right.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,120
Sisterhood is also very important.

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,600
Qi Guoqing,

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,640
if you mind our daughter's business,

38
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
do it to the end.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,160
Otherwise,

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,480
don't make things worse.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,920
She is already 25 years old.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,840
Can you worry about

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
her future?

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
She is still young.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,520
I think

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
it won't be late to consider her marriage when she is 30.

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
30?

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,220
It'll be too late when she is 30 years old.

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
At least she should marry someone she likes.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
She doesn't even communicate with young men.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,920
So she can't say whether she likes a man or not.

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,560
I think she

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
becomes stupid after watching too many TV series.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,570
Falling in love at first sight is something rare.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,770
What your mom said makes sense.

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,520
I'm going back to live with them.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
You can go back.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Take these books with you.

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040
I bought these especially for you in the afternoon.

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Take them back and memorize the knowledge.

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Take them.

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,840
Why did I let my mom

63
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
lead me by the nose again?

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I won't read them.

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,610
Wash your face and then come to eat.

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,360
♫Like a breeze♫

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,480
♫With words to say♫

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,880
♫I suddenly♫

69
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Mingyue,

70
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
you are back.

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Didn't you ask me to come back?

72
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Are you back to pack up things and move out?

73
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
So are you going to move back home?

74
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
OK.

75
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,120
Do I have to leave now?

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,840
What are you laughing about?

77
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,140
From beginning to end,

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
I didn't ask you to move back home.

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,520
You said it.

80
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,680
So,

81
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
so, you are not angry with me, right?

82
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,220
I thought about it.

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,640
You were right.

84
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,280
He doesn't like me.

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
It's not my fault.

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,160
You are right.

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,360
You don't need to be angry.

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,490
It's not your fault.

89
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
Besides,

90
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,000
at most, I was under the hallucination that he likes me

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,640
and caused a misunderstanding.

92
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,240
My little embarrassment,

93
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
compared with yours,

94
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,920
is nothing.

95
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,320
According to my observation,

96
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
Ling Xiao and He Ziqiu

97
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,560
haven't known

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
anything yet.

99
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,720
You are having

100
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,480
more than one romantic relationship at a time.

101
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,200
How would I miss

102
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,880
such a good show?

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
As the only one who knows the matter,

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,880
I must see you becoming the best actress

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,080
with my own eyes.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,720
Are you a devil?

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm so happy.

108
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
Excuse me.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,640
Why do you all keep silent?

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
Did anything happen

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,130
during the days when I was away?

112
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Qi Mingyue,

113
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,000
the misunderstanding between us...

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Never mind. There's no big deal.

115
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,880
We are not familiar with each other.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,000
A little misunderstanding is normal.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,240
Unlike the three of you.

118
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,800
You grew up together since childhood,

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
so, there is no secret between you at all

120
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,200
and you are frank and honest to one another, right?

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,800
Ziqiu,

122
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
are you going to

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,960
deliver a meal to your uncle?

124
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,120
Yes.

125
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
The meals served in the hospital are not nutritious.

126
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,680
So, I want to send him something good to eat.

127
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
Dad called me,

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,660
asking me to buy something to see him.

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
What happened to your uncle?

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,840
He has a cancer and is receiving chemotherapy.

131
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Can it be cured?

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,160
I think so. His cancer was found early.

133
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,820
The situation is optimistic.

134
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
That's good.

135
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,440
Mingyue, you are back.

136
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
Yes. Come to have breakfast.

137
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
♫Like a breeze♫

138
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,120
♫A breeze♫

139
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,200
Forget it. Forget it.

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
Forget it. Forget it.

141
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
What's wrong?

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,280
Ziqiu,

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,530
You won't force a kiss on me, right?

144
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

145
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
What kind of person do you think of me?

146
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,380
How could I force a kiss on you?

147
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,960
What if

148
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm not calm?

149
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,520
If you are crazy,

150
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
I'll squeeze your head

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
into the fridge

152
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,330
to let you cool down.

153
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
Good idea. Good idea.

154
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,280
Your answer is perfectly right.

155
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:34,960
What?

156
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,880
Did you deliberately

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,810
set a trap for me?

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
What is on your mind?

159
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,880
You are strangling me.

160
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,600
No.

161
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,600
By the way,

162
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
I heard Ling Xiao say

163
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
you had a quarrel with Tang Can last night.

164
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
What's the matter?

165
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,800
She criticized me first.

166
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Listen to me.

167
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
Look. Tang Can's nails

168
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
are like an old witch's.

169
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,440
If you have a fight with her,

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,800
you won't be a match for her.

171
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,460
Maybe you can use a cheap shot.

172
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,320
How?

173
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,280
For example, is she ticklish?

174
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,210
Then tickle her.

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
Good idea. Good idea.

176
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,040
Jianjian.

177
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,280
Did you click the links

178
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,000
of the public accounts I sent you yesterday?

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm going to talk about that

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
with you.

181
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Who wrote that article?

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
That's too exaggerated.

183
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
How come I became

184
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,920
a leading figure

185
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,280
in contemporary wood carving？

186
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,210
When did I become a leading figure?

187
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,880
I asked someone to write the article.

188
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
The number of clicks on the article

189
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
published on the two public accounts is good.

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,120
Our studio has more Weibo fans now.

191
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,220
There are over 30 new fans.

192
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,160
This is our

193
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,800
university newspaper.

194
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,640
Look at the headline.

195
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,520
This is just the beginning.

196
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,200
Later,

197
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
there'll be more public accounts and internet media outlets to report about our studio.

198
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm contacting them.

199
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,400
By the way,

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,640
the journalist

201
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,720
of our city's Morning Paper Weekly

202
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,800
has called me back.

203
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,120
She wants to make an appointment to interview you.

204
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,880
We must

205
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,080
publicize our studio

206
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,560
very well.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,160
Leave this to me.

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
You are great, honey.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
When did I say

210
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll be interviewed?

211
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,520
I don't want to say anything.

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,780
Cancel the interview.

213
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,760
Miss Li,

214
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,560
you can't do that.

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
This studio

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,080
doesn't belong to you alone.

217
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
It belongs to Juan too.

218
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,880
As a copartner,

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,880
you must

220
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,540
attach importance to the collective interest.

221
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm serious.

222
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
Look at the article.

223
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,200
It is too exaggerated.

224
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,240
When Mr. Peng reads it, he'll be angry.

225
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
What I do, which is not unworthy of my position,

226
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,000
is a taboo to him.

227
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Mr. Peng?

228
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,490
Her respected teacher Peng Yulin.

229
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,360
Mr. Peng

230
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,820
earns so much money a year.

231
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,280
He has been interviewed a lot.

232
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,040
What?

233
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,720
He only allows himself to make a lot of money,

234
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,380
He doesn't allow his student to make some money?

235
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,200
Did I hire you

236
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
as head of the publicity department

237
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,320
or my agent?

238
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,440
You are just an employee here.

239
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,360
Don't you know that?

240
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,400
I said no. Don't you understand?

241
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,120
Well. Well.

242
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
Why are you so alert?

243
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,120
In broad daylight,

244
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,210
can I do something improper to you?

245
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
Thank you, Miss Feng.

246
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,960
How is the development of your relationship

247
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
with Jianjian?

248
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
A boring message.

249
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,690
Have you held hands?

250
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,320
That is easy.

251
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,360
So you've kissed?

252
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,160
Don't worry.

253
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,060
I don't have a feeling for you now.

254
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Since you don't like me, I give up.

255
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,640
I don't want to let all the people in the hospital

256
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,900
know my private thing.

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,960
I swear

258
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,020
I absolutely won't let it out.

259
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm going out to have lunch.

260
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,960
Let's eat together.

261
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,040
Next time. Because I have an appointment with a friend.

262
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,800
Bye.

263
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Actually, you don't need

264
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,170
to treat me to a meal.

265
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,490
Order whatever you want to eat.

266
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not good at ordering dishes.

267
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,920
It is easy to order dishes.

268
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
You'll know whether the dishes are what you like

269
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,380
as soon as you look at the menu, right?

270
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Aren't you in a dilemma

271
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,760
when you look at the menu?

272
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
There are dozens of dishes on the menu.

273
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
But when people go to a restaurant,

274
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
no matter how long it may take,

275
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,680
people are used to

276
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,920
ordering something they are familiar with

277
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
and like.

278
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
After you understand that,

279
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
you won't feel it hard to order dishes.

280
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
My mom always complains that

281
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
I order the same dishes every time.

282
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,040
When your mom treats others to dinner,

283
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,370
she always treats them to seafood, right?

284
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,160
Waiter.

285
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,240
I would like to order dishes.

286
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,250
What would you like to have?

287
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Steamed scallop with garlic and vermicelli,

288
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,380
fried pawns with spiced salt,

289
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,440
and fried veal steak.

290
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,480
What vegetable do you want to eat?

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,340
Water spinach.

292
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
Water spinach doesn't taste tender

293
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
in this season, right?

294
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Fried lettuce with more minced garlic.

295
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,690
And a pot of scented tea.

296
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,960
Thank you.

297
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
OK. Please wait a moment.

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,280
I made it.

299
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,890
My mom orders dishes like that.

300
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,660
You did a very good job.

301
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
You treat me to a meal.

302
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,920
You even taught me how to order dishes.

303
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,560
I didn't teach you how to order dishes.

304
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
I just shared my experience

305
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,280
with you.

306
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,320
You were the one

307
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,120
who made the decision in the end.

308
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Right.

309
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,280
When it comes to order dishes,

310
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,840
I can't make my own decision.

311
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,040
You don't like me and that is normal.

312
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,930
I don't have my own ideas and I was under the hallucination that you like me.

313
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
Actually, you don't need

314
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,960
to treat me to a meal.

315
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I can understand.

316
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,600
I've found

317
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,120
that you like saying that you can't do anything

318
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,380
and blaming yourself.

319
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,290
I'm simply good at self-examination.

320
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,660
You are a good girl.

321
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,730
You just need to be more confident.

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
During high school,

323
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
you said that too.

324
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,400
Since I'm a good girl,

325
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,120
why don't you like me?

326
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,640
Does that

327
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,400
have anything to do

328
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
with whether I like you or not?

329
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,330
They are two different things, right?

330
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
You are right.

331
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,530
Actually, I'm not good enough.

332
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,700
You are really a good girl.

333
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,080
If you are not a good girl,

334
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,940
how would I make friends with you?

335
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,720
Thank you.

336
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,850
At least, you think I'm a good girl.

337
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,970
I still have to examine my own problem.

338
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,120
I think

339
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,720
perhaps I actually didn't

340
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,780
do anything right.

341
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,560
Don't say that.

342
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm really not good enough.

343
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,920
Come on. Let me finish.

344
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,800
We are friends,

345
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
but at the beginning,

346
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,780
I made friends with you

347
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,610
really because I wanted to take advantage of you.

348
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,880
During those years when I studied at the university in Singapore,

349
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,080
apart from studying,

350
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,400
I spent all my rest time

351
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,600
taking care of my mom,

352
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,250
sending Chengzi to school,

353
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,170
cooking, and doing housework.

354
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,080
At midnight, I had to get up several times

355
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,680
to see what my mom was doing.

356
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,120
She was unstable.

357
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
She would do

358
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
extreme things.

359
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,440
I was exhausted every day.

360
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,960
Every time when I

361
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,620
couldn't hold it much longer,

362
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,960
I would ask you

363
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,090
what Li Jianjian was doing.

364
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,160
In that way,

365
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,960
I could get out of

366
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,700
that kind of life for a moment.

367
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,160
If what you said is true,

368
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
I don't blame you for taking advantage of me.

369
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
I did those on my own.

370
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,970
You didn't force me to do anything.

371
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,500
You don't blame me.

372
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,160
But it doesn't mean I wasn't wrong.

373
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,320
I should apologize. Sorry.

374
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,280
Forget it. Just let it go.

375
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,880
Actually, what you told me today

376
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
makes me very happy.

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,320
At least I helped you.

378
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,160
You may as well say

379
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,020
thank you to me.

380
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,240
Thank you.

381
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,640
You're welcome, my friend.

382
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,349
I have a question.

383
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,280
If I say anything wrong,

384
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,339
please don't mind.

385
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,760
Before I went to Singapore,

386
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,310
we had known each other for just a year.

387
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,400
And in that year,

388
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,940
we almost didn't say anything to each other.

389
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,880
I really don't understand

390
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,680
since when you began

391
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
to like me

392
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,619
and why you like me.

393
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,880
I began to like you

394
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,520
since the first year in high school.

395
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,680
At the time, you were very gentle,

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,520
and you told me

397
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm actually a good girl.

398
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,920
So, I began to like you.

399
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Since then, you've always liked me?

400
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,040
Why?

401
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
You don't know about me at all.

402
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,200
I know about you.

403
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,760
You are really a nice guy.

404
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,720
We often talked

405
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,840
on WeChat,

406
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,120
but you only told me

407
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,180
about Li Jianjian.

408
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,040
You were not curious about

409
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
my life at all.

410
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,640
You didn't ask about my life.

411
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,680
I seldom

412
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,250
talked about my own things.

413
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
Can you say you know about me?

414
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,240
I know you lived a hard life.

415
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
What else do I need to know about you?

416
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,360
Since you knew I live a hard life,

417
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,420
didn't you want to know more about me?

418
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,800
I think perhaps

419
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,880
you are not that into me.

420
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
After you knew I like

421
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,200
Li Jianjian,

422
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,620
you felt more embarrassed

423
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,810
because of the misunderstanding.

424
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,480
So, what agreement

425
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,800
did you make with Ling Xiao in the end?

426
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,040
It was a misunderstanding.

427
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,640
Moreover, we've been friends for so many years.

428
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,320
And we'll often meet.

429
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,890
So we just made it clear.

430
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,920
Since high school,

431
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,320
you've been liking him secretly.

432
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,720
So you just made it clear?

433
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,400
He already has someone he likes.

434
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Then you just gave up?

435
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
Of course.

436
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
To show your utmost respect for your opponent,

437
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,240
you should show your own ability.

438
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
You are a person

439
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,400
who gives up easily.

440
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
But you've been liking him for nine years.

441
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,040
Is it possible?

442
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,400
Miss, is there anything wrong with you?

443
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,860
Just what do you like about Ling Xiao?

444
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,160
Not bad.

445
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
Richer than you?

446
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,800
I don't know.

447
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
Actually, on the way back,

448
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,450
I was thinking about the question.

449
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
Rather than loving him,

450
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
perhaps I prefer liking him secretly.

451
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,960
Secret love can be completed

452
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,120
and controlled alone,

453
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,050
without giving or making choices.

454
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,920
Moreover, every time

455
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,200
when I think of him,

456
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,580
I feel particularly happy and relieved.

457
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,360
I really don't understand.

458
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,050
How come there are people who prefer secret love?

459
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,490
That's so complicated.

460
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,530
I don't understand myself.

461
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,280
If a good man

462
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,160
tells you his feeling for you,

463
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
please,

464
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,720
just try to

465
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,360
have a romantic relationship with him.

466
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
If you go on like this,

467
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,120
your mom will take you home sooner or later

468
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,920
and make you get married with a man randomly found.

469
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,920
We are really fellow sufferers.

470
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,200
You are frustrated in love,

471
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,560
and I'm frustrated in career.

472
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,080
Look at Li Jianjian.

473
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,600
She is successful in all aspects.

474
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,330
Her works are even sold abroad.

475
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,460
Listen to the boast about her.

476
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,520
The leading figure of contemporary wood carving.

477
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
She is an artist.

478
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,720
We earn too little money.

479
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,640
You are a contract worker.

480
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm jobless.

481
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,400
We won't hold a candle to her.

482
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,120
Don't say that.

483
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
Think before you speak.

484
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,240
Li Jianjian,

485
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,280
your retaliatory way

486
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,440
of eating cake

487
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,360
makes me really worry

488
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,820
that you may get diabetes.

489
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,420
How come you know I'm here?

490
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,680
I was going to make a detour to the back door

491
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,040
and buy a small piece of cake

492
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,240
for you to eat at home.

493
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,840
I see.

494
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,530
But I've had enough.

495
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,600
Would you like to eat some?

496
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,120
OK.

497
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,690
I'll get a spoon for you.

498
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,280
About what happened last night...

499
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,610
I didn't think about it.

500
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,080
Oh.

501
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Really.

502
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,160
Oh.

503
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,440
Why did you say "oh"?

504
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,840
It means I got it.

505
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,450
You can't do that next time.

506
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
Do you think that's not good?

507
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,730
Of course, that's not good.

508
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
Pimples appeared here because of you.

509
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,240
You even blame me for that.

510
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,040
You have pimples

511
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,680
because you stayed up

512
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,480
and didn't do exercises.

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
No. It's your fault.

514
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,800
Well. It's my fault.

515
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,360
This noon,

516
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,980
I treated Qi Mingyue to a meal.

517
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
What did you say?

518
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,840
I apologized to her

519
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,680
and made everything clear to her.

520
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,920
Otherwise, as you often meet,

521
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,840
your sisterhood

522
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
may be affected.

523
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,520
What's wrong?

524
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
You are a little unhappy.

525
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
We've been on good terms for so many years.

526
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,330
But I didn't expect that Tang Can is jealous of me.

527
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,320
What do I have to be jealous of?

528
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,280
Our studio

529
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,200
began to make some money

530
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,120
this year.

531
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
And we are tortured by Party A every day.

532
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
One piece of work has to be altered again and again.

533
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,000
She is crazy to be jealous of me.

534
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,120
Well.

535
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,480
Don't be upset.

536
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,850
Perhaps she has a rough time recently,

537
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,250
so she is not in a good mood when she speaks.

538
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,720
I just hope

539
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,560
everybody will live a good life.

540
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,760
May the country be prosperous and the people at peace!

541
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,020
It'll be best when the world is peaceful.

542
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,610
My hopes are simple.

543
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,160
I hope my family members can live a happy life

544
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,140
without getting sick.

545
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,040
Absolutely.

546
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,100
Being healthy is the most important.

547
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,300
Anything else?

548
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,820
And I hope that after I get married

549
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,400
♫Like a breeze♫

550
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
with someone,

551
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
we'll have two children.

552
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,120
♫With words to say♫

553
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,020
Who'll have two children?

554
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,720
How many children do you want to have?

555
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,960
♫I suddenly♫

556
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,440
I want to have...

557

♫Realize that♫

558
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
♫Those seemingly insignificant days are full of love♫

559
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Come over. Let me hit you.

560
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,200
♫Realize, realize♫

561
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,480
No.

562
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't push me.

563
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,240
One.

564
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,760
♫That I can have all the happiness♫

565
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,760
Two.

566
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
Three.

567
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,240
Your flesh face.

568
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,320
♫As natural as the breeze♫

569
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,480
Don't squeeze my face.

570
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,160
Don't do that. I'm telling you.

571
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
On a girl's face, there are three fires.

572
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,160
Do you know that?

573
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,080
There are three fires on a girl's face?

574
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,360
Three fires on the head, right?

575
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
♫By your side♫

576
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,800
Don't squeeze my face. Don't...

577
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,560
OK.

578
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,360
How about you take a rest?

579
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,440
Just a carving of Guanyin.

580
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,080
I can carve

581
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,340
such a thing by myself.

582
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,040
But the client wants to receive it as soon as possible.

583
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,100
Where is Zhou Miao?

584
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,640
Right. He has to take part in the activity in the society in the morning.

585
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
He'll have lunch

586
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
with the journalist of the Morning Paper Weekly.

587
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,680
Why don't I know

588
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,400
that there are so many activities

589
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,080
in the societies in the university every day?

590
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
And in the afternoon, I'll

591
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
go to Ziqiu's coffee shop to be interviewed.

592
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,880
Why is he going to have lunch with the journalist?

593
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,210
Actually, what Zhou Miao thinks is right.

594
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Developing a good relationship with the journalist

595
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,320
is good for our studio,

596
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,840
isn't it?

597
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,400
Don't spoil him too much.

598
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Let him

599
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,370
do what he should do.

600
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,560
Anyway, I'm free.

601
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
I just care about him.

602
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,560
Be more tolerant towards him for me.

603
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,080
Am I not tolerant enough?

604
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,920
If I didn't consider your feeling,

605
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,200
I would have long fired him.

606
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,840
Well. Well. Take a break.

607
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,720
Come on.

608
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,520
Can we start now?

609
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,360
When did you begin

610
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,020
to be exposed to wood carving?

611
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,160
The first time when I was exposed to wood carving

612
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,040
was the summer holiday in my third year in middle school.

613
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,960
At the time, I

614
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
went into a wood carving studio by chance.

615
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,120
And I saw

616
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,760
a wood carving master

617
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,560
carving a sculpture of Guanyin.

618
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,880
I saw the kindly appearance of the bodhisattva

619
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,610
come to light little by little.

620
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,480
I was fascinated by it at the time.

621
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,680
When you were in the third year in middle school?

622
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,120
You were exposed to wood carving so early.

623
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,760
I became interested in it at the time.

624
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,000
Later I surfed the internet

625
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,680
and found some

626
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,320
websites wood carving enthusiasts often visit

627
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,360
and then bought some tools.

628
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
I learned to carve by myself at home.

629
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,960
Because I learned painting since childhood,

630
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,440
it may be a great help for me

631
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,700
to learn wood carving.

632
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,560
Look.

633
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,780
Our boss's sister.

634
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,600
She is really amazing.

635
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,530
A journalist is interviewing her.

636
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,920
How can she

637
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,760
be so successful?

638
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,040
That's why people say dragons and phoenixes come from a family

639
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,680
and excellent people come from excellent families.

640
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,560
Right.

641
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
A few days ago, I was worried

642
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,080
that our shop was going to close down.

643
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,680
Look. Every day,

644
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,400
the revenue is only 300 to 400 yuan.

645
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,800
We'll have to live on air.

646
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,680
Mr. He, whose dad is rich,

647
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,200
runs this coffee shop

648
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,760
to please his sister.

649
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
He runs it for fun.

650
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,720
He is handsome and rich.

651
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
He treats his sister so well.

652
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
She is not his own sister.

653
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
There must be something fishy.

654
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
Trust me. I'm absolutely right.

655
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Do you think

656
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,200
the desserts I make taste good?

657
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Yes.

658
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,720
The desserts in other coffee shops

659
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,380
cannot be compared with ours.

660
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,640
They taste good.

661
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,920
I think so.

662
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,080
Our boss

663
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,800
hasn't suffered hardships since childhood at all.

664
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,320
The cakes are sold at such high prices.

665
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Children cannot afford them at all.

666
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,600
Let's work.

667
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,000
Actually, I also think

668
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
traditional arts are charming,

669
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,240
but many of them

670
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,320
have failed to be handed down.

671
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,560
What a pity!

672
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,540
Yes, you are right.

673
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,040
I want to ask you

674
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,840
a question unrelated to your works.

675
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,600
From Two Boys and A Girl

676
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,240
you made,

677
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,600
we can see they were on very intimate terms with each other.

678
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,320
At present,

679
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,250
are you still on such intimate terms with each other?

680
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,840
These days,

681
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,370
there are fewer customers.

682
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,240
But it doesn't matter, as it is the slack season.

683
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,560
So,

684
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,920
to every customer, we should be more...

685
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,480
At present,

686
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
are you still on such intimate terms with each other?

687
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Remember to smile.

688
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
I think you have done a very good job in other aspects.

689
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Come on. Let's cheer for ourselves.

690
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
-Come on! Come on! -Come on!

691
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,380
OK. You are dismissed.

692
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,480
Business is not good?

693
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,210
There are almost no customers.

694
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,160
This is the slack season, you know.

695
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,920
Have you thought of

696
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,280
a way to deal with the problem?

697
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,040
Dad introduced a friend

698
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,800
to me.

699
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,320
A woman whose family name is Luo.

700
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
It is said that she specially

701
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,960
does preparatory work for the opening of chain coffee shops

702
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,420
and trains the employees.

703
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,760
I've invited her to my shop tomorrow

704
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,680
and I'll ask her for advice.

705
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,360
A woman whose family name is Luo?

706
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,560
Why haven't I heard of her?

707
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
I haven't either.

708
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
Anyway,

709
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,120
run your shop well

710
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,400
and don't

711
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,520
think about something that is messy from morning to night.

712
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,360
Why do I think about

713
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
something that is messy?

714
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,080
The money

715
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,160
you have invested in the shop

716
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
is hundreds of thousands of yuan, right/.

717
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,400
Even if the money was given by Zhao Huaguang,

718
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,660
it would be a pity if the shop is in the red.

719
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,880
Can you not mention Zhao Huaguang?

720
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,160
OK. OK.

721
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,160
You've put in a lot of hard work

722
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,480
to run this shop.

723
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Run it well.

724
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,940
Think more about the shop.

725
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
Don't think about women.

726
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,260
How could I think about women?

727
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,000
Are you a woman?

728
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,680
You are just a girl.

729
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,040
Why are you staring at me?

730
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,200
Ziqiu.

731
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,040
To tell you the truth,

732
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,680
I've really thought about

733
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
our wedding scene.

734
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,520
You,

735
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,200
you, you,

736
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
you've even thought about getting married, then...

737
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,200
That will really be a nightmare.

738
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,500
That will be terrible.

739
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,760
From the bottom of my heart,

740
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,440
you are my own brother.

741
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,780
Do you understand?

742
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,800
That is,

743
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
due to a quarrel,

744
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,360
we may have been on bad terms for many years,

745
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,040
but during the Spring Festival,

746
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
we can still

747
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,920
eat at the same table,

748
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,320
criticizing each other,

749
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,930
and we get rid of each other.

750
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,840
I,

751
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,720
I don't understand why we can't get married.

752
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,360
How come it will be a nightmare?

753
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
After we get married,

754
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,160
we can also

755
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
eat at the same table.

756
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,600
As brother and sister, we eat together.

757
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,640
But the husband and the wife

758
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,560
will sleep

759
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,240
in the same bed.

760
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,970
We can go to sleep together too.

761
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,440
Didn't we go to sleep together

762
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,640
since childhood?

763
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,960
The sleep you said is a noun.

764
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,320
You,

765
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,920
a girl,

766
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,240
what is on your mind?

767
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,280
You are so strange.

768
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,960
Why did you think of

769
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,840
that scary thing?

770
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,520
Ziqiu,

771
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,280
I'm 25 years old,

772
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,900
not five years old.

773
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,240
I haven't had

774
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,700
a romantic relationship,

775
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,180
but I'm not a girl who doesn't know anything.

776
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,540
The one you want to take care of

777
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,520
is the five-year-old Li Jianjian,

778
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,760
the ten-year-old Li Jianjian,

779
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,620
and the 16-year-old Li Jianjian.

780
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,000
But the 25-year-old Li Jianjian

781
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
can not only take care of myself,

782
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,740
but also take good care of you.

783
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,220
The form is not important.

784
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,160
Perhaps, legally,

785
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,640
our names don't appear in the same household register,

786
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,880
but in our heart,

787
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,480
there is always a household register

788
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,000
which has our names in.

789
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,700

Hello, Director.

824
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,100
My name is Tang Can.

825
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm 26 years old.

826
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,840
I'm 168 cm tall.

827
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,440
My weight is 48 kg.

828
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,760
I've taken part in all kinds of shooting of commercials

829
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,560
and TV series.

830
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,360
I can play all types of roles.

831
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,230
The role I play today is named

832
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,040
Li Tianna.

833
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
My acting starts.

834
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,280
I...

835
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,380
Li Jianjian bought liangpi (a noodle-like Chinese dish made from wheat or rice flour).

836
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Can, didn't you say

837
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,960
that you wanted to give up acting?

838
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,240
You told us

839
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,080
that you were always asked

840
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,920
to act as an extra,

841
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,720
so you wanted to give up.

842
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,080
What is on your mind?

843
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,320
Tell us.

844
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Come on.

845
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,200
Right. Tell us.

846
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,960
Let's talk about it.

847
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,210
We both support you.

848
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,280
Yes.

849
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,160
I've been taking part in all auditions,

850
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,930
but I've failed all of them.

851
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,920
Why did you hide it from us?

852
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,850
It's not like we don't support you.

853
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,200
I know you support me.

854
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,000
You've been

855
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,080
supporting me.

856
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,920
Right. Since high school,

857
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,450
we've been supporting you.

858
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,000
High school?

859
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,480
Yes.

860
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,800
Since high school,

861
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,460
I've begun to fail auditions.

862
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,040
Were kings of the land with frontiers

863
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,440
Blocked off from neighboring states

864
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,800
For thousands upon thousands of years.

865
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
To the west stands the Great Taibai the mountain high...

866
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,200
Reporting.

867
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,720
Through which up to...

868
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,440
Come in.

869
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,900
She is reading the textbook rather than the script.

870
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,240
Before everything was settled,

871
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,040
her mom had come to ask for leave for her.

872
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,400
Even the principal knew

873
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,720
and came to our class to see her.

874
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,760
She was boasting.

875
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,240
Director Zhou

876
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,760
can make the leading role popular.

877
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,040
How could it be so easy

878
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,770
to get the female leading role?

879
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,880
We shouldn't have believed what she said at the beginning.

880
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
She lied,

881
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,040
but why didn't the boys in our class

882
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,600
say anything about it?

883
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,300
Because she is pretty.

884
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,840
Isn't it bad

885
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,040
to talk about her like this?

886
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,770
We are classmates. Why bother?

887
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
The PE teacher is coming to catch

888
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,840
students eating snacks.

889
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Run!

890
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,480
Don't care about what others say about you.

891
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,560
They say that

892
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,360
because they are jealous of you.

893
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,010
They don't understand.

894
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,040
Everybody is striving

895
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,280
for such a good resource.

896
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,680
Failure is normal.

897
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,560
Am I right?

898
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,120
Nowadays people

899
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,040
are like this.

900
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,720
When you are successful,

901
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,170
they gather around you.

902
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
When you are not successful,

903
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,120
they laugh at you and make sarcastic remarks.

904
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,080
That's normal.

905
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,640
Don't take it to heart, baby.

906
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,840
Besides,

907
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,480
you've learned something

908
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,880
at the training in Beijing.

909
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,400
Right?

910
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,480
Gold

911
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,960
can glitter everywhere.

912
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,920
Yesterday, someone

913
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
from an agency in Beijing

914
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,600
called me,

915
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,120
saying that they saw you

916
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,960
in the training room.

917
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,240
They said you are excellent

918
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
and want to sign a contract with you.

919
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,800
An agency in Beijing?

920
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,600
Yes.

921
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,730
An agent whose family name is Wang.

922
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,440
How was your talk going?

923
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,280
Well. We just

924
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
talked generally.

925
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,200
We didn't talk much.

926
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,680
Anyway, I think

927
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,560
that kind of agency

928
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
is not helpful to us.

929
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,920
I can

930
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,000
be your agent.

931
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,600
I can arrange acting jobs for you, right?

932
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,640
There is something you don't know.

933
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,970
They are black hearted.

934
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,090
They want to take most of the money.

935
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,200
They say that as you are a new actress,

936
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,080
the ratio of the distribution of income is three to seven at the early stage,

937
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,520
and five to five at the late stage.

938
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,360
Oh, dear!

939
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,380
We can only earn

940
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,480
tens of thousands of yuan for a play.

941
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
But they want to get most of it.

942
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,040
What are they thinking about?

943
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,200
No, Mom,

944
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,760
those agencies

945
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,200
are responsible for packaging people and making them known.

946
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,480
Don't mention that.

947
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,560
That is deceptive.

948
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,560
I can make you known to the public.

949
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,160
Look at my publicity effect.

950
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
All our relatives and friends know you.

951
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,960
Last time,

952
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,160
the journalist called

953
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,200
and published an article about you in the newspaper.

954
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
That is different.

955
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,840
What is different?

956
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,760
You are too young

957
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
to understand it.

958
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,880
I won't talk so much.

959
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,480
Eat now.

960
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,370
Eat. Come on.

961
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,170
Don't you love eating beef?

962
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,000
Eat some beef.

963
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
These days, I've been thinking about

964
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,200
just what

965
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,160
went wrong.

966
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,480
In my professional view,

967
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,360
you didn't do a good job

968
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
during the training.

969
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,360
You were not active.

970
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,080
Your performance was not outstanding.

971
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,320
It was not exaggerated.

972
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,280
You should have expressed

973
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
all your emotions

974
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,880
in an exaggerated way, right?

975
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,480
If you don't express them, how can others know?

976
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,680
OK. OK.

977
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,040
I won't mention it. I'll stop.

978
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,120
It's all my fault.

979
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,200
Have some soup. Have some soup.

980
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,960
I won't mention it.

981
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,600
Eat. Eat.

982
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,400
♫Light is hidden in the night by the sunset♫

983

Don't be annoyed.

990
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,360
She is like that. She joked with you.

♫It’s just the past which will be gone tomorrow♫

I'll make her pay a lot of money.

1004

♫It has the unyielding colors♫

1011
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,880
At my most humiliating moment,

1012
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,840
you accepted me and supported me.

1013
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,840
I was really touched.

1014
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,880
But later,

1015
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,240
what I fear most

1016
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,370
is your support too.

1017
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,800
Do you know

1018
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,880
how I feel

1019
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,960
when I fail

1020
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,120
the audition

1021
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
and you encourage me every time?

1022
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,360
Your comforting eyes

1023
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,160
make me feel

1024
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm good for nothing.

1025
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,480
I feel I have no place to hide myself.

1026
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,840
Looking like a joke,

1027
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,170
I run my head into stone walls everywhere.

1028
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,080
If we are indifferent to you,

1029
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
will you be happy?

1030
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,040
For a success,

1031
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,440
even if she is spat on,

1032
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,840
it means jealous praise.

1033
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
For a loser,

1034
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,560
encouraging applause

1035
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,960
is like a slap in the face.

1036
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,640
The more you encourage me,

1037
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,520
the more I feel

1038
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,160
I'm not cut out for it

1039
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
at all.
