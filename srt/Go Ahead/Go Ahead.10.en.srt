Episode 10

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,480
Dad,

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
my teacher

6
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,320
called today.

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,910
He talked about

8
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,010
filling the application form.

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,760
What did he say to you?

10
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
He adviced me

11
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,960
to apply for

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,400
Beijing Jiaotong University as my first choice.

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
But I said

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,640
I need to talk about it with you.

15
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,240
Good.

16
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Don't you always want to apply for

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
that university?

18
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,290
I'm on your side.

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,930
You both are here today,

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,079
so I want to

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,079
talk about it with you.

22
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,010
Right. Let's talk about it. Right.

23
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,100
Actually, I've thought about it for a long time.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
I want to say

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,900
that I still want to study abroad.

26
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
Did

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,800
Zhao Huaguang

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,330
say anything to you?

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,560
He did talk to me.

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
But I thought about it.

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,680
I feel

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
it's a good thing.

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,420
And the guidance teacher said

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,170
that if conditions permit,

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,100
to study abroad

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
is good for me without doubt.

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
Why do you think of

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,640
studying abroad again?

39
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't you always want to study in Beijing

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,520
with Ling Xiao?

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,079
But going to study abroad may be

42
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,880
better for me.

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,880
Our family didn't have the conditions,

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,280
so I didn't

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
think about that.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
But now I feel

47
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,040
perhaps the advantages of study abroad

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,700
outweigh the disadvantages.

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Firstly,

50
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Dad, you don't need to afford

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,120
the expenses when I study in the university.

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,520
Then a lot of burdens on you can be relieved.

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,800
What burdens do I have?

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
It is not that hard

55
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,960
for our family.

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,320
But you work too hard.

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,540
Look. You even fell ill a few days ago.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
That's because of decoration.

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
I was tired.

60
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,120
You have problems with your lumbar disc

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,650
and your shoulders.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,260
You knead dough every day.

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,600
You haven't straightened your back these years.

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,460
And you have been using plasters.

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,560
We adults are like this.

66
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,800
We all work hard.

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,320
Look.

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm not the only one who works hard.

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,560
But I don't want you to

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,290
work so hard.

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,060
I don't want you to be so tired.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,440
You should

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,730
hire one more person

74
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,159
and rest more.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
Wherever I am, I'll

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,960
rest assured.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Dad,

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,980
I really want to study abroad.

79
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Let me go.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
Actually, it doesn't make any difference

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,520
where I go to university.

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,680
Studying abroad is just like studying in another city.

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,610
After graduation, I'll come back.

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,880
Well. Why did I

85
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,920
think of that?

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,970
After hearing what Ziqiu said,

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,340
I feel studying abroad

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
has only advantages.

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,520
It doesn't have disadvantages at all.

90
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,200
Am I right?

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,240
Studying abroad is a good thing.

92
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,200
How could

93
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,080
the two of us

94
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,880
not allow you

95
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,520
to study abroad?

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,159
Am I right?

97
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,090
Am I right? Haichao.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,120
Haichao,

99
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,780
he is waiting for your answer.

Your dad

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,840

A lot of oil has been added.

you will miss it.

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,840
Are Ling Xiao and Ziqiu

130
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,800
going to fill the application form?

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,280
Yes.

132
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,040
Ling Xiao's first choice is Peking University

133
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,560
and Ziqiu's first choice is Beijing Jiaotong University.

134
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,620
Both of them surely will be admitted.

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
But, thankfully, the exam was over

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,850
before his mom had an accident.

137
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,700
Otherwise, Ling Xiao would have been affected.

138
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,690
How is his mom recently?

139
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,220
Ling Xiao said she has come round.

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,200
At first, they didn't dare to tell her

141
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,160
that her husband and mom

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,440
had passed away.

143
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
So they kept what had happened from her.

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,880
They could kept what had happened on this side from her.

145
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
But how could they keep what had happened on that side from her?

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
So, they failed to keep it from her.

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,420
She was too sad and couldn't accept the fact.

148
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,280
Right.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,480
Nobody will accept the fact if such a thing happens to them.

150
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
By the way, Mingyue,

151
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,440
I want to buy shoes

152
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
for Ling Xiao and Ziqiu,

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
but the money I've saved is not enough.

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,760
I still need 200 yuan.

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Can you lend it to me?

156
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,650
I'll pay you back when the term begins.

157
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
How about this?

158
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,280
Anyway, Ling Xiao's birthday is coming.

159
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,640
I'll buy a pair of shoes as a birthday gift for him.

160
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,080
You can buy a pair of shoes for He Ziqiu

161
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,480
as a gift to congratulate him on going to university.

162
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
No, no. How could that do?

163
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
I must send the gifts myself.

164
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,030
Otherwise, if Ling Xiao knows,

165
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,280
he'll be mad with me.

166
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,440
Well.

167
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,030
Let's go.

168
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,400
Let's go.

169
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Let's go.

170
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,920
Ziqiu?

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,530
Why are you still sleeping?

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,040
You even locked the door.

173
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,520
Get up!

174
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,250
You are back.

175
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,160
Dad.

176
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm going to the construction site.

177
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,040
OK.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,520
Dad.

179
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
The two of you,

180
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
go and buy some food later.

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,050
There is no food at home.

182
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,720
OK.

183
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,520
You stay at home.

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,120
Did you have a quarrel?

185
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,320
A quarrel?

186
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,960
No?

187
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,440
Why do I find it a bit awkward?

188
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
Let Ziqiu tell you.

189
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,920
Or

190
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,440
you can talk

191
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,360
when Ling Xiao is back.

192
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,960
Are you talking about

193
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,560
celebrating Ling Xiao's birthday?

194
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,000
When he is back, let's celebrate his birthday.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,880
Let's talk about it then.

196
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
I've got to go.

197
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,760
What gift should I buy

198
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,240
for Ling Xiao?

199
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,020
I really don't know what I should buy.

200
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,780
How about I buy him a pair of sports shoes?

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,920
OK.

202
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,600
OK?

203
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,040
OK.

204
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,040
Son,

205
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,520
happy birthday.

206
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,920
Wish you good health,

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,940
safety and happiness.

208
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,880
Ling Xiao,

209
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,280
happy birthday.

210
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,690
Take good care of yourself.

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,140
Don't be too tired.

212
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
When you are back,

213
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
our family will celebrate your birthday again.

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Ling Xiao,

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,930
happy birthday.

216
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Come back early.

217
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,020
Li Jianjian misses you at home every day.

218
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
My dearest brother,

219
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
happy birthday.

220
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,720
Thank you for coming to this world

221
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
18 years ago

222
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
and becoming my brother.

223
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,240
I love you very much.

224
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
I love you till the end of time.

225
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,880
Till the seas dry up and the rocks decay.

226
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,240
Love you. Love you. Love you.

227
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Be happy.

228
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,720
Your mom is already like this.

229
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,050
But you can still smile.

230
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
I have to go back in a few days.

231
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
I've talked

232
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,040
to Jin.

233
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,700
I ask him to hire a care worker.

234
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,700
After he goes off work,

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,160
he'll come to help.

236
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,960
Anyway, you are going to university in September.

237
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,090
During this period,

238
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
stay here

239
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,920
to take care of your mom.

240
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,720
She can't do without people around.

241
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,320
I have to go back in a few days.

242
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,880
Did your dad ask you to go back?

243
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,440
No.

244
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
I haven't been home for long.

245
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,610
I miss my sister.

246
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,400
You...

247
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,620
Your mom is already like this.

248
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,040
But you still want to go back to see your sister.

249
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,300
She cried hard yesterday.

250
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,480
She was on a tranquilizer.

251
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,610
Didn't you see that?

252
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,360
The mother knows her son best.

253
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
When you were little, because of you,

254
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Yun died.

255
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,280
But you didn't shed a tear.

256
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,520
When your mom divorced and abandoned you,

257
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,200
our whole family scolded her.

258
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
But now, it seems that

259
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,120
your mom knows you best.

260
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,450
You are a cold-blooded animal!

261
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,890
Why didn't you go to bed?

262
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,820
Why did you turn off the light?

263
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,000
Happy birthday to you.

264
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,040
Happy birthday to you.

265
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,480
Happy birthday to Brother.

266
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,280
Happy birthday to you.

267
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
Brother, make a wish.

268
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,440
On my birthday,

269
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,660
I never make a wish.

270
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,760
Why?

271
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Because

272
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,080
I've never seen

273
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
miracles happen.

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
So I don't believe that there are gods.

275
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,240
There are.

276
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,880
But gods live in the heaven.

277
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
It is too far away.

278
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
You must make a wish in your heart

279
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,840
so loud that it can be heard.

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,560
Really?

281
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,280
Yes.

282
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,700
Did you make a wish loud in your heart?

283
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,530
Blow out the candle.

284
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm sorry, Brother.

285
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,560
It was too late when I went to the cake shop.

286
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,690
Only such a small piece of cake is left.

287
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,380
It doesn't matter.

288
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,370
Perhaps I'm destined to

289
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,760
get such a small piece.

290
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,840
No.

291
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,960
Let's eat the cake.

292
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,090
I'll get forks here.

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
I hear

294
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,120
people indeed grow up

295
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,720
in a flash.

296
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,840
Which moment?

297
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,840
Ling Xiao!

298
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,240
You are finally back.

299
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
I miss you so much.

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
Get down. It is hot.

301
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,160
No.

302
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,720
I want to be like this.

303
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,040
I'm not hot.

304
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,610
I don't care.

305
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,160
Get down. Get down.

306
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
No, no.

307
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,680
Come on.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,920
Jianjian

309
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,560
is not like a girl at all.

310
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,210
Eat shrimps.

311
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,160
Thank you, Dad.

312
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,960
Have a chop.

313
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,330
You're welcome.

314
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,650
You've become thinner.

315
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,650
Your dad hasn't been back for two days.

316
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,840
I guess he went to wait at a spot to capture bad guys again.

317
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,170
Did Ziqiu play outside?

318
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,840
Yes.

319
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,360
He went to play with his classmates.

320
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,640
I haven't seen him for two days.

321
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,170
He enjoys himself like mad.

322
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Don't criticize him.

323
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,240
If Ling Xiao wasn't back,

324
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,370
you would have played with Qi Mingyue.

325
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,920
Since Ling Xiao is back,

326
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,800
I won't go anywhere.

327
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,260
I'll stay with him at home.

328
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,160
It's OK that you stay with him at home.

329
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,080
But you can't

330
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,800
hold your brothers like that outside.

331
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Got it?

332
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I didn't hold him.

333
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,680
You didn't?

334
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,720
When I was in the kitchen, I saw it.

335
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,400
You jumped up on Ling Xiao's body fast

336
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,920
like a monkey.

337
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,400
Your legs were swinging.

338
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,260
Is that like what a girl should do?

339
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,080
I,

340
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,880
I just held him. What's wrong with that?

341
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
There are so many people kissing in the street.

342
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
Why don't you criticize them?

343
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,109
I don't care about others' children.

344
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,640
You are my daughter, so I must discipline you.

345
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,000
Look. Look.

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,859
Even Ling Xiao is laughing at you.

347
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,069
He is not laughing at me.

348
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,960
He is happy when he sees me.

349
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,589
Am I right?

350
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,400
You talk a lot at dinner.

351
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,160
Just listen to what I say

352
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,109
for a little longer.

353
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,280
When you go to university in Beijing

354
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,240
and want to listen to me

355
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,680
at meals,

356
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
you won't listen.

357
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,560
Cherish the time.

358
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,340
I want to have soup.

359
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,200
Eat and then have soup.

360
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,720
No.

361
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,000
I want to have rice mixed with soup.

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,040
Rice mixed with soup.

363
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,720
I think you look like

364
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,920
rice mixed with soup.

365
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,240
You are just back. Take a rest.

366
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,040
Come on. Eat the watermelon.

367
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,440
You eat.

368
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,400
Essence. Open your mouth.

369
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,320
You eat first.

370
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,280
Come on.

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,640
Tissues! Tissues! Tissues!

372
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,780
When we were little, we always wanted to grow up.

373
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,800
After we grew up,

374
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,490
we feel that childhood was so good.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,730
Our dads were young.

376
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,360
And we could

377
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,620
just be kids securely.

378
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Ling Xiao,

379
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,560
I want to tell you something.

380
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
I want to

381
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,730
tell you something too.

382
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,640
You say first.

383
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,000
Jianjian,

384
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,600
ask your two brothers to eat.

385
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,480
OK.

386
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
You dare to drink Dad's beer.

387
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,250
I'm going to university in Singapore.

388
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,490
What did you say?

389
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
Even if my mom is discharged from hospital,

390
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,880
she still needs long-term rehabilitation

391
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,340
before she can walk again.

392
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,920
Chengzi is unwilling to leave with our uncle.

393
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
If she really leaves,

394
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,440
my mom's mental state

395
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,500
will become worse.

396
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,400
Our school helped me apply for

397
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
universities in Singapore.

398
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,480
A medical college, after looking at

399
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,240
my profile

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,720
and results of the National College Entrance Examination,

401
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
was willing to accept me.

402
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,090
I have to go there next week.

403
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,400
I have to take care of my mom in the hospital.

404
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Didn't your mom leave you

405
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,060
to Li Jianjian?

406
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Didn't your mom abandon you?

407
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,970
Then why do you have to take care of her?

408
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Chengzi is your sister.

409
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,210
Isn't Li Jianjian your sister?

410
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,680
Are you insane?

411
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,600
Ziqiu,

412
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
after I leave,

413
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,980
I'll count on you to take care of Li Jianjian.

414
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,920
Why do you count on me?

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,570
I'm going to the UK soon.

416
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,560
I've been preparing materials

417
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,400
these days.

418
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,160
I've accepted Zhao Huaguang, that bastard,

419
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
as my dad.

420
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,260
Zhao Huaguang, that bastard.

421
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,770
What do you mean?

422
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,960
What do I mean?

423
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,960
I mean

424
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,100
we both are going to leave.

425
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,600
You'll go back to your home to live with your own mom,

426
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,040
and I'll go back to my home to live with my own dad.

427
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,520
We both are bastards.

428
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,320
We are both ungrateful.

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,060
What are you doing?

430
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,200
Don't fight. Don't fight.

431
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,640
Why,

432
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,000
why are you fighting?

433
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,600
What's wrong with you?

434
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,720
Just what happened?

435
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,920
Why are you fighting?

436
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,600
Tell me!

437
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,100
That's what happened.

438
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,340
OK. Let's talk about it when you are back.

439
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,560
It's nothing.

440
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,200
It's nothing.

441
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,800
OK.

442
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,360
Let's hang up.

443
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,520
Ling Xiao,

444
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,520
your dad is in Fuzhou

445
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,560
and will be back tomorrow morning.

446
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,620
Let's talk about it

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,480
with him when he is back.

448
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
There's nothing to be talked about.

449
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,720
You are not allowed to go.

450
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,760
Jianjian.

451
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,170
You are not to go either.

452
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,760
You don't allow either of them to go.

453
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
But the deadline for application has passed.

454
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
You, you, you want them to repeat the year?

455
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,530
Repeat the year.

456
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,560
How about this? Get into your room. Let me talk to you.

457
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,720
No. I don't agree.

458
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,040
Be good.

459
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,800
No.

460
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,020
I don't allow you to go. I don't agree.

461
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,560
Didn't Ziqiu say

462
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,720
that he'll be back as soon as he graduates from university?

463
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,780
Ling Xiao also said

464
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,000
that he is going to university in Singapore

465
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,080
and there's no difference between that

466
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,160
and going to university in Beijing.

467
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,680
It takes three or four hours to fly to both the places.

468
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
That makes

469
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,940
no difference, right?

470
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,920
If that makes no difference,

471
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,650
why didn't they dare to tell me?

472
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm confused.

473
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,440
What's actually going on

474
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,080
in our family?

475
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
Aren't those irresponsible people

476
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,840
outsiders to us?

477
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
Since childhood, you've been telling me

478
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
that as long as we take care of each other

479
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,080
and support each other,

480
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,200
we are family,

481
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,960
and that no matter how others look at us,

482
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,240
as long as we know

483
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,280
who is good

484
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,140
and close to us, that will be good.

485
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,500
Yes, yes, that's what I've been telling you.

486
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,920
But things are not that simple.

487
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
You are so angry.

488
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
Will your two brothers

489
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,520
feel good?

490
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
They feel bad.

491
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,960
Do I feel good?

492
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,620
Whatever decision they make,

493
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,180
they don't need to tell me,

494
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
or ask me for permission.

495
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,720
And they don't need to do

496
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,180
what they've promised me.

497
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,720
Sorry.

498
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,080
Even if I talked about it with you,

499
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,210
you wouldn't agree.

500
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,880
Right. I don't agree.

501
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,160
Why did they ask you to

502
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,680
take care of her?

503
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,120
You are still a student.

504
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,080
What about those adults?

505
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,660
She is my mom after all.

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,950
♫Just fade away♫

521
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,470
♫like in visionless haze♫

522
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,560

♫Those days with love and bound♫

♫When we you look up high♫

539
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,060

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,710
♫It will♫

541
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,170
Don't be hungry.

♫shine sometime♫

543
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,350
♫You're always there walking me long♫

544
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,640
♫Whenever something let me down♫

545
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,880
♫You make me feel where I belong♫

546
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,400
♫Face myself♫

547
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,800
♫If rain starts to pour down♫

548
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,830
♫You've taught me to fly on♫

549
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,680
We

550
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,340
actually have nothing to do with each other.

551
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,480
Right?

552
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,080
You are a neighbor.

553
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Ziqiu is fostered in my family.

554
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,120
We are not family.

555
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,120
Right?

556
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,920
No.

557
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,730
When you grow up,

558
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,340
let's be together for a lifetime.

559
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,760
OK?

560
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't believe that.

561
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,680
If you both leave,

562
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
you won't be my brothers.

563
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,040
Ziqiu?

564
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,040
You...

565
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,400
Jianjian

566
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,600
cannot accept

567
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,860
the fact at the moment.

568
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,940
Give her some time.

569
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,480
She'll be ok.

570
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,360
I just feel

571
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,400
sorry to her.

572
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,320
You don't need to feel sorry.

573
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,040
Because you

574
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
have been together

575
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
since childhood,

576
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,530
and have never parted with each other.

577
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,020
You suddenly said you are going to leave,

578
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,800
you hate to part with each other.

579
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,760
I understand.

580
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,040
However,

581
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,120
anyway,

582
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,040
when you grow up,

583
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
you all have to part with each other.

584
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,010
You'll get married,

585
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,620
start your own family,

586
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
be busy with your own things,

587
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,210
and live your own lives.

588
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,370
I won't get married.

589
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,420
I'll stay with you all my life.

590
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
Don't be silly.

591
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,640
When children grow up,

592
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,300
they all leave their parents.

593
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,080
If they really don't leave,

594
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,680
they live off their parents.

595
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,180
Then I'll stay with Li Jianjian and protect her.

596
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
What if she gets married?

597
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,820
She can't get married.

598
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,740
What if she feels wronged?

599
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,440
You...

600
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,840
Well.

601
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,600
Let's talk about it

602
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
after you grow up.

603
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,640
Dad,

604
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,560
when I'm away,

605
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,360
what if Li Jianjian

606
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,020
is bullied?

607
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,800
Then she should

608
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
fight back.

609
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,440
So should you.

610
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,280
When you are abroad,

611
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,160
and we are not around,

612
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,720
if you are bullied,

613
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,040
you have to rely on yourself to fight back.

614
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,640
There will be no other way.

615
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Ziqiu,

616
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,780
people suffer from

617
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,410
a lot of injustice in their lifetimes.

618
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,040
The older you are,

619
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,280
the more you have to bear.

620
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,600
One day,

621
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
you'll find

622
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,480
the whole world

623
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,720
is on your shoulders.

624
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,370
The whole world?

625
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,680
Your parents,

626
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,160
wife,

627
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,480
and child.

628
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,300
aren't they your whole world?

629
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,740
What about brothers and sisters?

630
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,740
They have their own world.

631
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,560
But in my world,

632
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,000
it'll be enough to have you guys.

633
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,240
Ziqiu,

634
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
don't think too much, OK?

635
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,160
Life is just like

636
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,240
a long-distance race.

637
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
You need to accumulate your energy.

638
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,960
Accumulate your energy

639
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,690
for the second half of the race.

640
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,760
Think about this. Back then,

641
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,400
when Mr. Ling and his family

642
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,360
moved here,

643
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
and I met you

644
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,140
for the first time,

645
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,140
you were such a little boy.

646
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
In a flash, you'll go to university.

647
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,280
Time flies.

648
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,480
However,

649
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,200
in retrospect,

650
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,640
although it was not easy,

651
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,680
I've spent most of my life.

652
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
Don't think too much.

653
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,570
Take one step and look around before taking another.

654
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,320
Besides,

655
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,000
didn't you say

656
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,540
you'll come back as soon as you graduate?

657
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,060
What do you want to say?

658
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,680
Say it.

659
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,000
Dad,

660
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,740
I'm going to the UK.

it's time to eat.

698
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,450
Where is she?

699
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,610
You went to your grandma's?

700
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,620
You are already on the way?

701
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,360
You won't go to those training classes

702
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,490
during the holiday?

703
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,360
Why didn't you tell me that

704
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
in advance?

705
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,560
I'm starving.

706
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,680
Dad.

707
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,360
Yes.

708
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,810
We thought something happened to you.

709
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,240
What's wrong with your face?

710
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,800
I'm fine.

711
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Aren't you going to

712
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,400
take part in

713
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,360
a carving competition?

714
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
You are not going?

715
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,000
OK. OK.

716
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,240
When you arrive at your grandma's,

717
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,720
call me using the fixed phone.

718
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,850
Talk in detail then.

719
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,650
Haichao,

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,880
Jianjian went to her grandma's?

721
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,210
Ling Xiao was just back yesterday.

722
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,050
What's wrong with your face again?

723
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,800
Answer me.

724
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,920
You were just back yesterday.

725
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,580
The two of you fought outside?

726
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,800
Well. Well. You...

727
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,200
Go and wash your hands.

728
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,000
After you eat,

729
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,720
let Ling Xiao tell you.

730
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,450
Tell me what?

731
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,840
You were just back yesterday.

732
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Then the two of you went out to create trouble.

733
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,760
Are you interrogating criminals?

734
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
Go and wash your hands.

735
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,890
Are you qualified as his uncle?

736
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,120
You can't take care of her,

737
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,320
so you want my son to.

738
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,360
You even asked to go to university in Singapore.

739
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,920
How could you have such an idea?

740
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,160
You are used to being an official.

741
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,480
So you want to arrange for anyone you want?

742
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,160
Stop.

743
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,320
Has Ling Xiao

744
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,660
been brought up by Chen Ting's family

745
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,120
or your family?

746
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,440
You didn't take care of him.

747
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,520
After she had an accident,

748
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,640
he is her own son now?

749
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,760
Then are all our family

750
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,040
your grandchildren?

751
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
You want to hear something pleasant?

752
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,760
I haven't said anything unpleasant yet.

753
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,680
I'm telling you.

754
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,160
The people of your Chen family

755
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
are all morally bad.

756
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,360
You are selfish and self-conceited.

757
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,440
Yes.

758
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,020
I'm talking about you.

759
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,450
It is hard for everyone.

760
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
It is hard for you.

761
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,280
So you make things difficult for my son?

762
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Don't tell me you feel bad for the child.

763
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,320
At his grandma's funeral,

764
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,680
Ling Xiao, as the grandson,

765
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,000
has knelt for seven days.

766
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,560
Chen Xu, the granddaughter,

767
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,440
has knelt for less than three days.

768
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,760
Then you let her go back to school.

769
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,040
Now you're telling me you feel bad for my son.

770
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,370
What did you do earlier?

771
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
From today on,

772
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,320
Ling Xiao won't consider you as his uncle.

773
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,440
Let's not visit each other during Spring Festivals or other festivals.

774
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,900
Our family doesn't need you as our relative.

775
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,960
Calm down.

776
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,840
Don't be so angry.

777
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,440
Ling Xiao,

778
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,400
can you

779
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,370
change your application back?

780
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,980
The medical college in Singapore

781
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,290
has accepted me.

782
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,960
Why didn't you call me

783
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,200
to talk about

784
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
such a big thing?

785
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,720
You are going to university. You are going abroad.

786
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,450
You are going abroad. You know?

787
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,840
How come you want to

788
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,880
learn medicine?

789
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Is it because of

790
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,120
your mom's accident?

791
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,920
No.

792
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,600
Then why?

793
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
What are you doing? You strike the table and get angry with

794
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,200
the child. Come on.

795
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,680
You spoiled him. I'm telling you.

796
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,760
You didn't talk about

797
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,090
such a big thing with me.

798
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,640
He didn't talk about it with you either, right?

799
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,200
What's the use of talking about that?

800
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,000
That's something

801
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,260
that has been settled.

802
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,560
He has been

803
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,200
very sad.

804
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640

and close to us, that will be good.

864
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,560
♫tell us♫

865
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,820
Whatever decision they make,

866
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,340
they don't need to tell me,

867
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,800
or ask me for permission.

868
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,760
♫to be fearless♫

869
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,200
And they don't need to do

870
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,040
what they've promised me.
