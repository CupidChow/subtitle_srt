00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 8

4
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
The child knows nothing.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
As adults,

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,200
we should arrange

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
the child's future

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
as early as possible.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,280
Even if I take him home,

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
you can rest assured,

11
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,000
because I won't stop him

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
from contacting you.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,660
After all, you brought him up.

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Well. Stop.

15
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,280
In our family, we respect

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,640
the children's opinions.

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,440
What is he going to do in the future,

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
and what school he will go to...

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,730
You are narrow-minded.

20
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Sorry.

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,360
I didn't mean to

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
look down upon you.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,440
After all, you run a noodles restaurant,

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,320
so you have limited field of vision.

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,120
You know what?

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,240
Nowadays, those families,

27
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,880
as long as they have conditions,

28
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,720
give the best to their children

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,120
with all their might.

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,680
Even if they have to surrender their last resource,

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
they want their children

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
to have a bright future, right?

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Enough. Stop it.

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
I'll talk to Ziqiu.

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,120
That's it.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Why does what I said

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,720
make no sense to you?

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,560
If you keep the child here like this,

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,090
he won't have a good future.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Your purpose is

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
to let him take care of you when you are old, right?

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,040
Don't you want to take him back

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,560
and let him continue your family?

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Come on.

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
He is my son

46
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
and I want to take him back.

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Is there anything wrong with that?

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,980
The only difference between you and me is

49
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,120
that I can give all my family property

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
to him in the future.

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
But you keep him here.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
You are hindering his development, aren't you?

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm doing this for his own good.

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,960
For his own good?

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,220
What did you do before?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,880
Get out of here.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,400
No.

58
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,040
Wait. I got it.

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,460
You think one million yuan is too little, right?

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,680
Even if you put ten statues of the God of Wealth here,

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,920
in this small noodles restaurant,

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,800
how many years will it take you to earn

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
one million yuan?

64
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,380
Tell me.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
How much on earth do you want?

66
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,930
Don't talk about money with me.

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,040
I earn money

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
by my own hands.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
If I take money from you,

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,280
I feel sick.

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,000
Get out of here!

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,930
Get out! Get out!

73
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,540
Get out!

74
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,780
Get out of here!

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
Li Haichao,

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
what do you mean?

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm telling you. Doing this

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,040
is no good to

79
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
us at all.

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,160
You are unreasonable.

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,400
Who are you?

82
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Why did Haichao

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,520
drive you out?

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,269
I,

85
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,240
I'm He Ziqiu's dad.

86
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
He Ziqiu's dad?

87
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,480
Yes.

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,530
I'm his biological dad.

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,280
May I know your surname?

90
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,040
My surname is Zhao.

91
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Bah!

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
You are shameless.

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,480
What bastard are you?

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,840
Why do you abuse me?

95
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,640
I abuse you?

96
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Are you a man?

97
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
There are people everywhere in the street.

98
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
Why don't I abuse anyone else?

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
You are a bastard.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,080
Haichao,

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
don't be polite to him.

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,040
Do you have boiled water here?

103
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
Splash water to drive him away.

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
You have no manners.

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
You are unreasonable.

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Who is unreasonable?

107
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,159
You.

108
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,320
Who is unreasonable?

109
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,200
Stop there!

110
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,120
You bastard!

111
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,460
What's wrong with you?

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm exhausted.

113
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,480
I haven't finished the assignments

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,540
our teachers gave,

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,120
but the teachers at the cram school gave a lot of assignments.

116
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
If a machine is invented

117
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,960
to help people do homework,

118
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,290
that will be wonderful.

119
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
You wish.

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,400
Didn't Ling Xiao and Ziqiu come here with you?

121
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,720
They are going to take part in the National College Entrance Examination.

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,380
So, they are studying at home.

123
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,900
It's good that they are studying.

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,880
I thought

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,960
that because of Zhao Huaguang,

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,690
Ziqiu doesn't dare to come out.

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
That's impossible.

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,760
Ziqiu said

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,600
that Zhao Huaguang didn't come to him again.

130
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,240
Moreover,

131
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,000
last time when Zhao Huaguang

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,880
went to see my dad,

133
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,960
Mrs. Qian in our community

134
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,760
was going to splash water on him.

135
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,900
I guess he doesn't dare to come again.

136
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,620
What do you want me to go with you to do?

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,159
Mr. Huang called me,

138
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,680
asking me to give the notes I took in class this week

139
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
to Tang Can.

140
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,600
She'll be absent from school again next week.

141
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,440
She hasn't finished making up last week's missed lessons yet.

142
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,120
No wonder

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,000
she had to transfer to another school and repeat a year.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,159
She asks for leave so often.

145
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,520
Even if she went to study in Grade 5 at primary school,

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,640
she wouldn't be able to keep pace with the others.

147
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
No need to give the notes to her.

148
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,120
They won't be useful for her.

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,920
She won't understand even if she sees them.

150
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know whether she can understand.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
But this is a task Mr. Huang gave me,

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,570
so I have to complete it.

153
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,770
Let's go.

154
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,160
She has to catch a plane in the afternoon.

155
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,280
Can I say no?

156
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's go. Let's go.

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,760
Come on.

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,450
Let's go.

159
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,250
There's something wrong with her.

160
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
On such a hot day,

161
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,600
we come to give her the notes,

162
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
but she keeps us outside,

163
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,159
without treating us to drinks.

164
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,250
That's something unexpected.

165
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,000
But it makes sense.

166
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,640
Something was wrong with this girl

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,920
long ago.

168
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,159
She's too much.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,900
She's really too much.

170
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,920
It's so hot.

171
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,560
Stop talking.

172
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,960
So depressed.

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Stop talking.

174
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Sorry for bothering you to come here.

175
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,800
I suddenly received an audition notice.

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,530
I'm going to Beijing and stay there for a few days.

177
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
We've been waiting for you for half an hour.

178
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,160
I was packing up.

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,000
You were packing up,

180
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
so you kept the two of us

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,680
waiting in the sun?

182
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,240
I don't like

184
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,200
to stop doing something halfway

185
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
and then

186
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
do something else.

187
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
You could have asked the security guard

188
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,400
to let us come in

189
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,360
so that we could give them to you.

190
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,880
I don't want to let others know

191
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
where my home is.

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,360
Because it's not safe.

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,690
After all, you also know

194
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,320
that I have a special job.

195
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,040
I can understand

196
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,800
your worries.

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
After all, to deal with you who deserve a beating,

198
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,400
it is likely that people will spray paint

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
on your house.

200
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,970
As a public figure, you can't lose temper.

201
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,520
Give the notes to me.

202
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm going to catch the plane.

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,760
No notes for you!

204
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
You can't understand even if you have them.

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,600
Miss Tang, the last place，

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,280
come on.

207
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,720
Don't get the last place

208
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,650
in the audition.

209
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,090
Come on! Come on!

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,640
Anyway, I don't want to

211
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,800
see the notes at all.

212
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,800
I recovered.

213
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,360
When you lost your temper just now,

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
you looked so cool.

215
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,690
What can I do?

216
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
How should I explain it to Mr. Huang?

217
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,840
Perhaps Mr. Huang just

218
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
said that casually.

219
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,720
I, I hope so.

220
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,020
You were really cool just now.

221
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,680
It made me feel very secure.

222
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm flattered.

223
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,120
I just felt

224
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,120
that it would be OK if I stayed there alone.

225
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,440
But you were there with me.

226
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,760
So, I was mad at her.

227
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,920
I feel so happy.

228
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,680
Let's go. Let's go.

229
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,570
It is just around five o'clock, but it is already closed.

230
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,320
Dad,

231
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,480
why did you close the restaurant at the supper time today?

232
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,680
Dad?

233
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
Li Haichao?

234
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,600
Ziqiu?

235
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Ling Xiao, are you in?

236
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,520
My dad...

237
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,010
You are in the hospital?

238
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,920
Who is sick?

239
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,980
The customer got food poisoning?

240
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,080
Dad,

241
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,180
what happened?

242
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,880
How come the customer got food poisoning?

243
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,920
Where is he now?

244
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,370
Where is he? Is he OK now?

245
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,120
Was he sure that he got food poisoning after having the noodles of our restaurant

246
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,640
or

247
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,960
eating something else?

248
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,760
You asked so many questions

249
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
in one go.

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,240
Which question should I answer?

251
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Answer me.

252
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
What should I say?

253
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,850
Are you cooking?

254
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm cooking noodles.

255
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,320
My noodles!

256
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,200
It spilled out.

257
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,160
Dad,

258
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,680
did anyone take revenge on

259
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,840
our restaurant?

260
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
Our kitchen is so clean.

261
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,040
How come

262
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,240
cockroaches and flies

263
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,560
were found in food these days?

264
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,200
Now,

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
a customer got food poisoning.

266
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,600
So,

267
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,060
what is the situation now?

268
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,280
The customer who found a cockroach in the food last time

269
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,880
called the food administration

270
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,210
and we have been warned.

271
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,120
This time,

272
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,120
the customer who got food poisoning

273
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,200
also reported us to the administration.

274
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,960
Now we are compelled

275
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
to suspend business to bring up to standard.

276
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
To suspend business?

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
This is to force our family

278
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
to die.

279
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't talk nonsense.

280
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,840
Come on.

281
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
It can't go so far.

282
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
No big deal.

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
It's just that we'll stop doing business for a week.

284
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,920
We can just

285
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
do a general cleaning

286
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,570
during this period.

287
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,600
The range hood

288
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
and ventilating fan

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,040
making noise in the kitchen

290
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,640
should have long been replaced.

291
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,360
Besides,

292
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
are those

293
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,680
what you should worry about?

294
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,640
You guys

295
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,320
rest assured.

296
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,240
Focus your mind

297
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
on your studies.

298
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,090
Understand?

299
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,040
Mr. Li,

300
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
let's install a video surveillance system

301
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,460
in the restaurant.

302
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,240
We can explain things with evidence.

303
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,680
Right.

304
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,960
You are right.

305
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,040
We need to install it.

306
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,500
Yes, we need to install it.

307
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
I think the noodles you cook

308
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,080
cannot be eaten.

309
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,380
Let me cook something simple.

310
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,200
Beef rice.

311
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,560
I remember there are three onions

312
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,400
in the fridge.

313
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,800
Dad,

314
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,160
the three of us are going to buy something

315
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,620
at the convenience store.

316
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,320
Go.

317
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,900
Just buy whatever you want to eat.

318
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,640
It's too late. Eat this.

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,320
Why do you discipline me in everything?

320
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,000
I want to discipline you.

321
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,120
When we get home,

322
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,240
don't ask about the matter again.

323
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,000
Did you hear me?

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,440
Why?

325
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,180
Didn't Mr. Li say that?

326
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
It is a matter the adults should handle.

327
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,360
You just need to study hard.

328
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,800
You always consider me as a kid.

329
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
You are a kid.

330
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,650
On July 3, this year,

331
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,090
I'll be 18 years old.

332
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,370
I'll be an adult.

333
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
What's the big deal?

334
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
On your 18th birthday,

335
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,760
when the time comes,

336
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,920
can you grow up in a flash

337
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,760
and immediately shoulder

338
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,820
the burden of life?

339
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,280
Can you be so amazing?

340
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,090
Do you want to eat it?

341
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,240
No. There is all your saliva.

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,320
Why did you ignore us?

343
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
What are you thinking about?

344
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,090
I'm thinking

345
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,840
it would be great

346
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,370
if I could grow up in a flash.

347
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,980
Then Dad doesn't need to work so hard.

348
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,600
I hope so.

349
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,440
I hear

350
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,040
people indeed grow up suddenly.

351
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,170
What do you mean?

352
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,160
It means

353
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,580
on your 18th birthday,

354
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
you will be legally an adult.

355
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,240
But that's not the true sense of growing up.

356
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
To grow up to an adult in the true sense

357
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,160
is something to happen in a moment.

358
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,040
Which moment?

359
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,050
The moment no one else knows

360
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,560
but only you know.

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
When you change your mind

362
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,290
and feel the weight of life,

363
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,720
at that moment,

364
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,600
you grow up quietly.

365
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Generally, when will

366
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,050
the moment come?

367
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,620
In the next second,

368
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,600
tomorrow,

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,330
the day after tomorrow,

370
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,120
or

371
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,720
in 10 years, 20 years,

372
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
or a lifetime.

373
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,840
As expected, what you said

374
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,920
is extraordinary.

375
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,900
It is freezing.

376
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,200
Try it and see whether it is freezing.

377
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,260
Don't do that to me.

378
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
Why didn't you order anything?

379
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,310
What do you want to drink?

380
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,569
Let me order it for you.

381
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,300
Our noodle restaurant stopped doing business.

382
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,170
Did you ask people to play tricks?

383
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,069
Why did you ask me that?

384
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,240
I didn't.

385
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
You want to see me to talk about that?

386
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,000
A child is a child.

387
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,080
You can only put forward problems,

388
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,560
but you can't solve them.

389
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,210
I'm begging you. OK?

390
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,740
We are no match for you.

391
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,240
Ziqiu,

392
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,720
you are my own son.

393
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
Will I hurt you?

394
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,360
My dad gets up at half past three

395
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,220
every morning.

396
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,960
Then he goes to the restaurant to knead dough,

397
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,360
stew beef and spareribs,

398
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,020
and fry peanuts and soybeans.

399
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,760
He works there from early morning to seven o'clock in the morning.

400
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Then he goes back home to cook breakfast

401
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,960
for the whole family.

402
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,020
Since I was a little child,

403
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,850
no matter how busy he is,

404
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
he has never let us make do

405
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,480
for our lunch and supper.

406
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,280
The noodles restaurant is the only source of income

407
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,200
of our family.

408
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Can you let us off?

409
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Since you know

410
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,050
life is not easy for Li Haichao,

411
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,120
you should think for him.

412
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,570
You haven't made money.

413
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
You don't know how hard it is

414
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
to make money.

415
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,060
You are going to college soon.

416
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,320
And your sister

417
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,280
will go to college in the future too.

418
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,010
The expenses

419
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
will be greatly increased without being aware.

420
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,200
You know?

421
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,520
It is extremely hard

422
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,560
for an ordinary family to support a child.

423
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,490
But he has to support two children.

424
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,760
You want to make him exhausted to death.

425
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
After I go to college, I can

426
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,760
do part-time jobs to make money.

427
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,400
You mean

428
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,860
you still don't want to go with me, right?

429
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,200
No.

430
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,840
Well.

431
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,980
Let's wait and see.

432
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Ziqiu,

433
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
you are my only son.

434
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,520
No matter what happens,

435
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
I won't give up on you.

436
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,200
I'll give you time.

437
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Think about it.

438
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,700
What else do you want to do?

439
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,400
I went to the restaurant

440
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,210
to see how you will improve.

441
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,440
But it is closed.

442
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,200
Now you are drinking.

443
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
You are back early today.

444
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,940
Come on.

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
Drink with me.

446
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,040
I changed shifts with my colleague

447
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,840
to see whether you need any help.

448
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,080
Being like this,

449
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,540
you are not worried at all.

450
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,900
I haven't been so free for so long.

451
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
I'll have several days off.

452
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,730
You won't improve the restaurant?

453
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,820
I just want to tell you something.

454
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,880
I had an idea

455
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,480
long ago.

456
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,440
I remember I told you

457
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,840
that my restaurant

458
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,360
is kind of small

459
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,720
and the decoration is outdated.

460
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,200
Here is my plan.

461
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,560
I want to get the ownership of the restaurant next door.

462
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,360
The restaurant next door.

463
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,800
Mm.

464
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,840
I want to get the ownership of it.

465
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,700
So, we can run a large restaurant.

466
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Think about this.

467
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,280
Prices are getting higher and higher.

468
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,120
These children are going to take part in

469
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,200
the National College Entrance Examination.

470
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,660
They need to go to college.

471
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,680
We'll have to spend money

472
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
in more and more aspects.

473
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,720
So, we have to make more money, right?

474
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,840
OK.

475
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,920
The front of the restaurant next door

476
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,600
is OK.

477
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes.

478
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
Let's not rectify problems.

479
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,440
Let's just expand

480
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,720
and open the business again.

481
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
Right. Run a big restaurant.

482
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,360
Yes.

483
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,840
Otherwise, Zhao Huaguang

484
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,170
would say with sarcasm,

485
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,120
"Your small restaurant

486
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,320
doesn't make money."

487
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,200
He always says that

488
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,080
to the child.

489
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,600
He'll affect the child's mood when he takes exams.

490
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,120
OK.

491
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,880
You don't have enough money.

492
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,760
I'll give you

493
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,620
all my savings.

494
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,600
Well. Stop.

495
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,680
Money is needed

496
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,610
in many aspects.

497
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,280
Keep your savings.

498
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,450
They will be used for urgent needs.

499
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,360
As for the money,

500
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,040
I've asked about it

501
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
in the bank.

502
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,440
I can mortgage the old house my parents left me

503
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,840
to get loan from the bank.

504
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,120
This is also a way.

505
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,040
Then, how about this?

506
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,520
Well.

507
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,600
I'll pay for Ziqiu's

508
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,040
living expenses and tuition

509
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,880
in the future.

510
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,000
Come on.

511
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,600
As a policeman, how much money can you earn?

512
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Come on.

513
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,240
Can you earn

514
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,760
as much as me, the owner of a noodles restaurant?

515
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,240
Right?

516
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,800
I have money. I'm telling you. Rest assured.

517
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,600
OK. OK.

518
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,480
I'm telling you.

519
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
Then this is settled.

520
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,600
OK.

521
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,480
I'll pay for Ling Xiao's living expenses and tuition.

522
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
You are really funny.

523
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,960
Your thermos cups

524
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,560
have been filled with

525
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,220
warm water.

526
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,800
Remember to drink it.

527
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
How about you check again?

528
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
Your ID cards and admission tickets.

529
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,560
Whether you have sharpened

530
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,480
your pencils.

531
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,520
Dad, rest assured.

532
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:40,880
Last night,

533
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,440
you checked for us

534
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,100
many times.

535
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,760
Right.

536
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,660
I'd better send you there.

537
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
Mr. Li, don't go with us.

538
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Go to monitor the decoration of the restaurant.

539
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,640
Jianjian will go with us, right?

540
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,520
Yes, she will go.

541
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm ready. I'm ready.

542
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm ready.

543
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,720
Where is Mr. Ling?

544
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,980
He went to borrow a car.

545
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,490
It has been a while. But he hasn't come.

546
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,320
By the way, Ling Xiao, Ziqiu,

547
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
are you wearing the red underpants I gave you

548
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,180
to wish you success in every exam?

549
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,520
Yes.

550
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,560
Yes.

551
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,010
Let me check.

552
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,060
Have you finished?

553
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,680
OK.

554
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,320
What else should we pay attention to?

555
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
You are going to take part in the exam in No. 2 High School.

556
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,960
I've made an on-the-spot investigation there.

557
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,680
Look.

558
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
This is the south gate.

559
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
When you get in from the south gate,

560
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,520
you must enter from the left door,

561
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,240
and after the exam,

562
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
you must come out from the right door.

563
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,560
Enter from the left and come out from the right. Understand?

564
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
And look,

565
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,320
this is the statue of Confucius.

566
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,520
After you get in, you must do this.

567
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,880
Bow before it sincerely.

568
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,200
It is said that it is particularly efficacious.

569
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Got it. You are talking a lot.

570
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,120
You are loquacious.

571
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,720
Be patient.

572
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,560
Let me give you a test.

573
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,280
OK. Go ahead.

574
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,400
What should you do as soon as you get the paper?

575
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,160
Write my name on it.

576
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,690
And then?

577
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
Answer the questions.

578
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,920
I've told you a lot of times.

579
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
After writing your name,

580
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
you should do this.

581
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,040
Kiss the paper.

582
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,200
It means you'll surely do well in the exam.

583
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,960
OK.

584
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,920
The car arrived. Hurry.

585
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Go downstairs. Go downstairs.

586
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,520
Let's go.

587
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,520
Let's go and talk. Let's go and talk.

588
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,880
Let's go and talk.

589
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,760
Dad, we are going.

590
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
Mr. Li, we are going.

591
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,640
Keep calm.

592
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,140
Just do as you normally do.

593
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,900
Wait. Don't open the door.

594
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,120
Dad,

595
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,960
at nine o'clock,

596
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,040
remember, at nine o'clock,

597
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,800
burn incense for my mom,

598
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,530
asking her to go and bless them.

599
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,520
Ah. OK.

600
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,420
What else do you want to do?

601
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
The good time comes. Open the door.

602
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,520
Let's go.

603
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,850
You are superstitious.

604
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,520
Let's go.

605
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,160
Go!

606
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't be nervous.

607
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,440
OK.

608
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,880
Wish you success in every exam! Wish you success in every exam!

609
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,610
Wish you success in every exam!

610
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,380
Wish you success in every exam! Wish you success in every exam!

611
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,920
Tang Can, what is the procedure

612
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
of the selection like?

613
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
We are all curious.

614
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,960
Right. Right.

615
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,520
Which place did you get this time?

616
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm among the top 5 candidates.

617
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,560
- Top 5.
- Top 5. Top 5.

618
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,720
You'll surely get the first place.

619
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Right. I think you'll

620
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
almost get the first place.

621
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,450
Mingyue.

622
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,320
How did your brothers do in the exam?

623
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
Ziqiu said the exam is not hard.

624
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,320
It's not a problem for Ling Xiao.

625
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,240
That's great.

626
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,360
That star

627
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,890
succeeded in the audition?

628
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,280
Among 2,000 candidates,

629
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,240
she is one of the top 5.

630
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,970
Next week, she'll get trained.

631
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,880
The chance rate

632
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,540
is only 20%.

633
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,480
But she is so proud of herself.

634
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Whoever acts Director Zhou's film

635
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,240
will be a hit.

636
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,680
She is one of the top 5 among 2,000 candidates. Isn't she amazing?

637
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,010
But there is only one female leading role.

638
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,120
The students in the third year

639
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
have finished their exam and left school.

640
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,680
But we are still at school.

641
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,780
Concentrate on your studies.

642
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,340
Tang Can, you are back.

643
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
How is everything with you?

644
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,840
Sir,

645
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,900
I'm among the top 5.

646
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,240
I'll get trained in Beijing starting from next week.

647
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,900
Good. Good.

648
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,120
Let's encourage

649
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,480
Tang Can, the actress.

650
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,740
Everybody, applause.

651
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Tang Can! Tang Can! Tang Can!

652
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,720
OK.

653
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,180
Now, class begins.

654
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,000
Last time, you wrote a composition entitled

655
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
"A Good Friend I Can Learn From".

656
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,810
Three students did a very good job.

657
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,540
Qi Mingyue,

658
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,480
Zhao Qing,

659
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,240
and Wang Yajie.

660
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,040
As usual,

661
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,920
let's ask them to read their composition.

662
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,250
You can learn from them.

663
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,460
Qi Mingyue,

664
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,080
you first.

665
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Sir, I have a sore throat.

666
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,360
Well.

667
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,450
Give it to me.

668
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,320
I'll read.

669
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,840
"A Good Friend I Can Learn From".

670
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,160
"On the day when I met him,

671
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
I didn't think

672
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,040
that day was different

673
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,160
from any of

674
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,520
the other days.

675
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
As usual,

676
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,520
I carried my schoolbag and walked on the way to school.

677
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,560
I passed

678
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,040
the green wall filled with vines.

679
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,600
That day

680
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,400
was different from

681
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,720
any of the other days.

682
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,040
Because when I was bullied by

683
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,120
bad guys,

684
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,780
someone stepped forward bravely for me..."

685
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,120
Li Jianjian, you've been mad with me all day long.

686
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,880
You couldn't have been so mad.

687
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,840
Why?

688
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,760
If you were in my shoes, wouldn't you be mad?

689
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,600
I just...

690
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,160
"...someone stepped forward bravely for me,

691
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,120
yelling 'The police are coming!

692
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,360
Don't let them escape!'

693
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,880
The two bad guys were scared and slipped away."

694
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Did you mention Ziqiu?

695
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,600
Did you mention me?

696
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,400
Only Ling Xiao

697
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,120
stepped forward bravely for you.

698
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,080
What about the two of us?

699
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,680
No, no.

700
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,800
It's a composition.

701
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,400
I couldn't write about fighting.

702
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,860
It was easy to write about what Ling Xiao did.

703
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
"I was sitting on the swing alone,

704
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,080
crying sadly.

705
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,760
The warmth he gave me

706
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,840
was like a gentle stream,

707
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,400
cleansing my soul.

708
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,890
It was like the sunlight shining on me.

709
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,120
Oh, no.

710
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,920
At that moment, I felt

711
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,920
he was sparkling."

712
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
There are exaggerations

713
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,780
and metaphors.

714
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,560
They are figures of speech usually used in compositions.

715
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,200
You know.

716
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,960
I don't know.

717
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
Anyway, you skipped the details of

718
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,560
Ziqiu and me,

719
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,600
and only mentioned that you can learn from Ling Xiao.

720
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,930
I'm unhappy about that.

721
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,800
Do you think

722
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,480
I do poorly in my studies,

723
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,560
so I'm not worth being learned from?

724
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,360
No, no.

725
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,640
I was wrong.

726
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,980
I'll write about you alone next time.

727
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,600
Really?

728
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,200
Really. Only you.

729
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
Then I'll see how well you can do.

730
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,880
Li Jianjian,

731
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
when you see Ziqiu

732
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,760
and Xiao,

733
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,600
would you please not mention it?

734
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,920
I won't!

735
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,280
If I do, Ziqiu will be really pissed!

736
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,680
He was the one who helped you.

737
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
OK. OK.

738
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,080
Let's go and celebrate with them.

739
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,610
Let's go.

740
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,520
Next time,

741
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
it'll be only about me!

742
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,360
OK.

743
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,200
Come.

744
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,720
Come.

745
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,320
Let's toast to our daughter

746
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,160
who's one of the top five!

747
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,560
OK.

748
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,960
Cheers!

749
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,040
-Come.
-Come.

750
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,320
I'm so happy!

751
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,240
Mom,

752
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm only one of the top five.

753
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,040
What if I fail?

754
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,360
No, you won't!

755
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,680
I've asked about

756
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,000
the other four girls.

757
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,090
Three of them

758
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,400
are not as pretty as you.

759
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,560
And the prettiest one

760
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,520
has no experience

761
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,280
in acting.

762
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,640
Even the assistant director

763
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,520
who's in charge of casting said

764
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,600
that Director Zhou would definitely choose you in the end.

765
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,480
So shouldn't you trust

766
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,200
his choice?

767
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,080
Yeah!

768
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,480
You've been acting in movies and TV series since childhood.

769
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,340
You can do this.

770
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,480
I have faith in you!

771
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,940
Yes, to be more confident!

772
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,720
I have faith in you!

773
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,650
I will work hard!

774
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,440
Good.

775
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,320
Come.

776
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,200
I've never expected

777
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,120
today before.

778
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Look.

779
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
Your mother's family is poor

780
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,880
and so is your father's family.

781
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,560
Your father and I

782
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,840
don't have good educational backgrounds.

783
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,600
I used to work as a cashier in the supermarket

784
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,460
and your father

785
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,440
is a long-distance truck driver.

786
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,160
He always goes out to work for days

787
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
and I'm so worried about him.

788
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,560
If the crew hadn't gone

789
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,840
to your class to choose

790
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
child actresses

791
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
when you were in the first grade,

792
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,920
how would we have known

793
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,440
that you could do this?

794
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,240
Right?

795
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,320
Yes.

796
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,840
You're a talented daughter from a poor family.

797
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
Your mother should take the most credit,

798
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,720
because she gave birth

799
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,650
to a beautiful and smart daughter.

800
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,840
Have some more.

801
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,040
My dear,

802
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,600
in the future,

803
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,640
your father and I

804
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,840
are counting on you.

805
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,360
I'll be your agent

806
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,580
and your father

807
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,200
will take care of everything at home.

808
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,800
No problem.

809
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,680
From now on,

810
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
both of us will take good care of you.

811
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,840
Don't worry.

812
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
After I become famous,

813
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,640
you won't have to work anymore.

814
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,880
I'll hire two people

815
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,920
to take care of you.

816
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,720
So you can just enjoy your lives.

817
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,360
I'm looking forward

818
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,680
to enjoying a happy life!

819
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,800
Come. Let's drink.

820
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,000
OK!

821
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,400
Good.

822
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,280
Excuse me, your steamed sea bass.

823
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,210
-Thank you.
-OK.

824
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Put it here.

825
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,000
Thank you. Please enjoy it.

826
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,440
OK.

827
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,280
Excuse me, your steamed sea bass.

828
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,610
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

829
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,090
Please enjoy it.

830
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,220
Is that the actress

831
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,160
in your class?

832
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,520
So what?

833
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,560
I worked so hard to hold it in.

834
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,320
I waited until

835
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,280
Miss Tang and her parents

836
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,360
finished eating

837
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,440
and left.

838
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,160
I thought she was a hypocrite,

839
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,640
but I didn't know

840
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,360
that she would even lie

841
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,240
about her parents' jobs.

842
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,400
Does she feel embarrassed

843
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,260
by her parents?

844
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah. Is it necessary?

845
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,760
You've been overhearing it

846
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
next to us?

847
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,280
What have you heard?

848
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160
Nothing.

849
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,240
Nothing.

850
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
I'm warning you!

851
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,360
Even if you want

852
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
to defame me in school,

853
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
it won't work,

854
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,920
because no one will believe you.

855
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,450
We don't want to defame you.

856
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,480
Even if we tell everyone the truth about you,

857
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,000
there's nothing wrong with it.

858
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,480
Yes.

859
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,320
How dare a liar be so aggressive!

860
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
I'm not a liar!

861
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,840
My mom used to work at Carrefour.

862
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,320
Isn't Carrefour one of the top 500 companies in the world?

863
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,520
My father is a long-distance truck driver.

864
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,600
Isn't that logistics business?

865
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,520
They misunderstood it

866
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,920
and it has nothing to do with me.

867
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
She's right.

868
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,280
Yeah.

869
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,690
Then we're good.

870
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,560
Now we're leaving.

871
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,160
Bye.

872
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,200
Who let you leave?

873
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,920
So what, Miss Tang?

874
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,580
Do you want to get us silenced?

875
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,760
I'm warning you!

876
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,280
Don't tell anyone about it!

877
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,360
If you tell anyone about it,

878
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
there'll be serious consequences!

879
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,480
I just can't stand it!

880
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,440
Do you really think you're that famous?

881
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,240
Who wants to tell anyone about your nonsense?

882
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,600
Stop it.

883
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,560
Do you really think

884
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,600
that someone like you

885
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,120
can threaten me?

886
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,800
No. No.

887
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,960
How dare you threaten me to my face?

888
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,960
Don't force me to do it!

889
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,160
The person who was beaten up by me last time

890
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,640
hasn't recovered completely yet.

891
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,560
Would you like to try it?

892
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,880
Don't punch her in the face!

893
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,740
She still has to go on an audition.

894
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,480
Anyway, I'm warning you!

895
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,520
I've warned you!

896
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,040
Don't tell anyone about it!

897
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,370
And I'll watch over you!

898
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,800
Stop! Stop!

899
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Don't stop me!

900
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,080
I'll punch her in the face!

901
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,640
Stop it.

902
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,320
Don't stop me!

903
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,250
She has left. She has already left.

904
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,810
You held me too tightly.

905
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,640
What a bummer!

906
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,080
We got caught on the spot.

907
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,600
Your hard work was in vain.

908
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,570
Don't tell anyone about it!

909
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,560
Here. It hurts!

910
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,120
Here?

911
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,560
Yes.

912
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,750
Well, Dad,

913
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,360
is there anything

914
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,190
I can do to help

915
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,280
with the renovation?

916
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,190
Would you like me

917
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,480
to mix cement and water?

918
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,040
Well,

919
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,040
please don't do that.

920
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,680
You don't have to do that.

921
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,600
You've just graduated,

922
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,200
so you should go and have fun.

923
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,610
Is the graduation dinner tonight?

924
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,840
Oh, yes.

925
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,480
What about the classmate party?

926
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,810
It's tomorrow evening.

927
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,320
OK.

928
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,090
I'll give you another 500 yuan,

929
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,680
so go and have some fun.

930
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,180
Tell me if it's not enough.

931
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:23,880
No need.

932
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
It's enough.

933
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,440
Dad, you don't have to

934
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,360
work so hard.

935
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,800
When I go to college,

936
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,520
I can

937
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,740
do some part-time jobs to make money.

938
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,650
What are you talking about?

939
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,720
I want you to go to college,

940
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,580
instead of doing part-time jobs.

941
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
Don't worry about money.

942
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,920
Our noodle restaurant

943
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
is different now.

944
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
It's no longer a small restaurant

945
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
with just a few workers.

946
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,450
It'll be a big noodle...

947
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,640
I'll make

948
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,920
a lot of money,

949
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,250
so don't worry about it.

950
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Since you know

951
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,840
how hard it is for Li Haichao,

952
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,080
you should do something for him.

953
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,450
You've never made money before

954
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,800
and you don't know

955
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,330
how hard it is to make money.

956
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
You're about to go to college

957
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
and Li Jianjian

958
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,460
is about to go to college, too.

959
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,480
It'll cost

960
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,920
a lot of money,

961
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,680
you know?

962
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,040
It's hard for an average family

963
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,080
to support a college student,

964
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,480
and he has to support two!

965
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,580
Do you want to exhaust him?

966
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,360
It's so late now.

967
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,560
OK. I have to go now.

968
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,360
I need to

969
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,760
ask them to do something.

970
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,640
What do you want to eat?

971
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Go and buy some

972
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,770
in the supermarket.

973
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,180
By the way, Dad,

974
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,520
would you like me to cook for lunch?

975
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,120
It's easy to make some curry.

976
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,600
OK.

977
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,220
Do it on your own

978
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,730
and don't get burnt.

979
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,690
Don't worry.

980
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,000
Has Zhao Huaguang come to see you recently?

981
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,120
No.

982
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,680
OK. I'm leaving now.

983
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,200
OK.

984
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,200
Focus.

985
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,480
We'll have curry for lunch

986
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,440
and I'm going to buy some food in the supermarket.

987
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,900
What would you like to eat?

988
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,200
Two bags of original potato chips

989
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,920
and crispy ice cream

990
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
with chocolate on it.

991
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,580
You know it.

992
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,810
Watermelon.

993
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,840
Money!

994
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,960
Put it on my bill.

995
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,560
Don't forget

996
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,360
that you've already owed me

997
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
60 yuan this month.

998
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,800
I'll pay you back when it's 100 yuan.

999
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Watermelon is a kind of fruit

1000
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,320
and it belongs to family expenses.

1001
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,180
My service fee!

1002
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,440
How stingy!

1003
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,080
Here you are.

1004
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
Where is my 5 yuan change?

1005
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,360
Li Jianjian, lend me some money.

1006
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,280
Again?

1007
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,680
I've lent you 20 yuan.

1008
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,220
I'll pay you back when it's 50.

1009
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,400
Thank you.

1010
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,360
Xiao,

1011
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,880
don't you want to go out and play

1012
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,560
after the college entrance exams?

1013
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,320
No.

1014
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,120
But I want.

1015
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
You can go after finishing the homework.

1016
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,520
Don't you have an exam before the holiday?

1017
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm afraid you can't get into

1018
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
a beauty salon with your grades,

1019
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,800
let alone Central Academy of Fine Arts.

1020
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,080
I still have two more years

1021
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,440
and I'm an art student.

1022
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,700
I need just 300 points.

1023
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,560
You made a mistake again.

1024
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,880
I've told you not to hit me in the head.

1025
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,680
Will you marry me if I get hit out of my wits?

1026
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,440
Yes, I will.

1027
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,340
Yes, I will.

1028
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Ling Xiao!

1029
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,240
Ling Xiao!

1030
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,320
Yes?

1031
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,960
Hurry up!

1032
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,440
your grandma has had a heart attack

1033
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
and they're trying to save her.

1034
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm going to grab something upstairs.

1035
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,640
Let's go to the hospital right away.

1036
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,200
Hurry up!

1037
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,650
Xiao, just hurry up.

1038
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Hello, Chen Ting?

1039
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,090
Are you on your way back?

1040
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,760
I know you have no other choice.

[Emergency room]

1042
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
Mom is in a particularly bad situation now

1043
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,240
and the doctor has

1044
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
given us the critical illness notice.

1045
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,440
My wife and I are here.

1046
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,040
OK.

1047
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,760
When will she come back?

1048
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,640
There's no tickets

1049
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,840
and she'll come back tomorrow morning.

1050
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,040
Can she make it

1051
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,160
to tomorrow?

1052
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,240
She has no other choice.

[Emergency room]

1054
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
She shouldn't have married into another country.

1055
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,370
We can't count anything on her.

1056
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,000
Mom is dying now,

1057
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,530
and she can't get back soon.

1058
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,160
What's the point of saying this now?

1059
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,360
It doesn't help at all.

1060
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,440
Uncle, Aunt,

1061
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,920
how is grandma?

1062
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,720
They're still trying to save her.

1063
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,680
A few days ago,

1064
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,480
she said that she had a pain in the chest.

1065
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,940
I asked her to see a doctor,

1066
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
but she refused

1067
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,080
because she didn't want to waste money.

1068
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,800
None of us had ever

1069
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
had this kind of disease,

1070
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,450
so we didn't know it.

1071
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,680
She could eat, drink

1072
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,810
and shout at others,

1073
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,380
so we thought she was fine.

1074
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,520
However,

1075
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
she was fine when we were having breakfast,

1076
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,720
but after that,

1077
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,200
she was dying all of a sudden.

1078
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,560
Calm down.

1079
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,560
No one could

1080
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,600
have expected it.

Is Chen Ting

1083
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,120
on her way here?

1084
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,900
She didn't get the tickets and she'll come back tomorrow morning.

Well...

1086

Oh.

1087
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,680
OK, I got it.

1088
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
I'm hanging up.

How is it?

Xiao won't come back today.

1091
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
They've got

1092
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,680
the critical illness notice for four times

1093
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,640
and the doctor said

1094
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,880
that the family members should stay there.

1095

Mr. Ling won't come back, either.

1096
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,920
He said he could help

1097
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,120
if anything happened

1098
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,600
How did it become so serious?

1099
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
She was energetic when she came here

1100
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,330
to shout at Ling Xiao last time.

1101

She's only in her sixties.

1102

Don't think too much about it.

OK, Dad, let me take care of it.

1108

I'll do it.
