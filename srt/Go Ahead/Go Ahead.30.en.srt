00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 30

4
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,440
Let me see.

5
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,420
Fortunately, it's not bleeding.

6
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,120
So dirty.

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,300
Here, put it on.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,920
What's going on at this time of night?

9
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
Couldn't you just tell us?

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey, my neck.

11
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,620
You're throttling me.

12
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,280
Stop strangling me, my neck.

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Ziqiu.

14
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,170
Ziqiu, you're strangling her.

15
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,360
Zhao Huaguang's child is five already.

16
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,620
So he doesn't need Ziqiu anymore.

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,440
Why do grown ups

18
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,300
like giving birth to so many kids?

19
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,020
They clearly don't like them.

20
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,520
They don't,

21
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,010
but kids are useful to them.

22
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,290
They need kids to put their hopes onto,

23
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,020
or to carry on the family line,

24
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,760
or to take care of them when they're old.

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,090
I really don't understand.

26
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
How did this happen?

27
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,500
Couldn't you react differently?

28
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,240
Let me know

29
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,970
what exactly you're thinking.

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Why did you have to take this decision on your own?

31
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,120
You're the one who said

32
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,480
that there is nothing

33
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,600
between us.

34
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,800
Why did you have to get involved

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,520
in my life?

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,640
When I was going through my hardest times,

37
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,700
I never asked Zhao Huaguang for help.

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
I tried so hard.

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,440
Just so I didn't have to ask

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,880
Zhao Huaguang for help.

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,240
I thought that after I graduated,

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I would come back.

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,760
You abandoned me,

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,480
but I never hated you.

45
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,440
Zhao Huaguang abandoned me,

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,900
I didn't hate him, either.

47
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I just thought...

48
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
I just thought...

49
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,280
that I was a real disgrace.

50
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,760
Wh-Why...

51
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
Why am I always

52
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
the one that gets abandoned?

53
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
Why is it always me?

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,780
Is there something wrong with me?

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,490
I've been thinking about it

56
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
all the time.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,880
But I can't figure it out.

58
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,640
I just thought...

59
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,900
that I couldn't just come back like that.

60
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,960
Why is it that every time

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm feeling down,

62
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,400
when I,

63
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,720
when I need a home to go back to,

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,760
it was always Li Jianjian and Dad

65
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
that took me in.

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,520
So I had to make money

67
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,000
before I could come back.

68
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,480
I wanted to open

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,810
a coffee shop that Li Jianjian would love.

70
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
The shop window should be full

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,760
of all the desserts she loves the most.

72
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,080
She could eat as much as she wanted

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
and they would never run out.

74
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,280
I wanted everyone to know

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
that I was doing well.

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,770
I was doing really well.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,159
I don't need pity.

78
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,760
I don't need

79
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,820
to care what anybody thinks about me.

80
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,720
I wanted to earn as much as I could

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,850
and be good to my dad.

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,620
I wanted to be good to Li Jianjian.

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,930
I have to earn money,

84
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,480
so that I can give

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,880
the best things I have

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,100
to those who hadn't abandoned me.

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,040
Sorry.

88
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,840
Don't say sorry.

89
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
I beg you.

90
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,160
You have a new family.

91
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,420
You have your own life.

92
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,850
Just go on with your life

93
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,520
the way you want to

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
and enjoy it.

95
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,400
No regrets.

96
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
You don't want to live with regrets.

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,000
I beg you.

Wow, it smells so good.

135

You are making an omelet!

136
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Stay away.

137
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
Oil may splash on you.

138
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,160
What can I do to help?

139
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,520
Make the salad.

140
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,520
OK.

141
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Take care. Don't cut your hand.

142
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,440
My hand is steadier than yours.

143
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,200
Do you forget last time

144
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
you cut your hand?

145
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,880
Don't mention the past, all right?

146
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,840
Fine, fine, fine.

147
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,770
Hurry up! Plate!

148
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,840
Jianjian.

149
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Ziqiu, you got up?

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,120
Get washed. The breakfast will be ready soon.

151
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,720
All right.

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,930
Ask Ling Xiao to breakfast.

153
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,600
Ziqiu, eat a tomato.

154
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
Since you three are all here,

155
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,720
I want to talk about last night.

156
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,160
Dad,

157
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
don't mention it.

158
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,080
Why not?

159
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,920
I made myself clear

160
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,960
last night

161
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,520
and you heard me.

162
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,650
Now that I've made my point,

163
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,060
there is no need to talk about it anymore.

164
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah,

165
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,400
you've grown up

166
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,240
and have your own ideas.

167
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,280
There are many things

168
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,720
you don't want to tell us.

169
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,010
For those you tell us, I can't fix them either.

170
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,840
Dad, that's not what I meant.

171
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
I tell you

172
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
everything.

173
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,490
You keep so many things from me.

174
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,520
Here,

175
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,840
I must reflect upon myself.

176
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm not a good father.

177
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
I can do nothing

178
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
except for cooking you meals.

179
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,800
Here we go again.

180
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Dad, I didn't...

181
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,200
Don't cut in.

182
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,520
Hear me out.

183
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm indeed

184
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,810
a little muddleheaded.

185
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
For a lot of things,

186
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,240
I think we should just try to get over them.

187
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
If we can't,

188
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,520
just hold on

189
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,960
and keep moving forward.

190
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,940
We'll finally get over it.

191
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,520
So,

192
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,640
these years, you three

193
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
were like strangers.

194
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,960
As your dad, I was caught in the middle

195
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,420
and couldn't do anything.

196
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,440
You don't have to.

197
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,600
I am the one that should be blamed.

198
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,820
I have a bad temper.

199
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,120
I should reflect on myself.

200
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
If so, isn't it my fault?

201
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,010
Your mom passed away early.

202
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,080
I always feel sorry for you.

203
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
So even if you make a mistake,

204
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
I hate to scold you.

205
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,600
To be frank,

206
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,240
I just take

207
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,570
whatever you said to me,

208
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,340
because I don't want trouble.

209
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,160
Right?

210
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,440
Even if I know your problems,

211
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
I can't solve them for you.

212
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,080
So I just

213
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,410
bury my head in the sand.

214
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,380
Mr. Li, you think too much.

215
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,440
As grown-ups,

216
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,920
we can't let you

217
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,580
worry about us on everything.

218
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,170
Especially you, Ling Xiao.

219
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,540
You are different from Ziqiu.

220
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,200
I take you

221
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,480
as my son,

222
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,680
but after all, you are not my son.

223
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,840
Sometimes, you suffered wrong,

224
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,170
but I felt I was in no position to get involved.

225
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,040
I know sometimes,

226
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,920
you suffered as much as Ziqiu.

227
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,040
You see,

228
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
we've been like families for years,

229
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
but I've never really got your back.

230
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
I said we were families,

231
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,520
but I didn't act as I said.

232
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,920
I was afraid to ask you

233
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,160
about everything.

234
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,930
This is called negligence.

235
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,360
Sometimes,

236
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,400
kids just make small mistakes,

237
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,920
but adults make

238
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,720
most of the big mistakes.

239
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,120
However,

240
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,400
adults are not as brave as kids.

241
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,880
They don't even have the courage

242
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,280
to admit their mistakes.

243
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,850
Now let's be frank with each other.

244
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,520
Ziqiu,

245
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,320
You have reasons not to forgive your mom.

246
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
She did make these

247
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
unforgivable mistakes.

248
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,980
But there is something you must know.

249
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,880
Last night,

250
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,560
she knew you worked

251
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
in the cafeteria,

252
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,120
so she called

253
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,480
Zhao Huaguang

254
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,960
and gave it to him.

255
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,170
Later, we drank a lot of wine

256
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,860
and talked about many things.

257
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
She told me

258
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,320
why she went to Shenzhen.

259
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,980
[Summer 1999]

260
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,640
Hello, Madam,

261
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,310
do you want to know something about this?

262
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,069
Are you He Mei?

263
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,440
I'm not. Wait a minute.

264
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,480
He Mei.

265
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,329
She's looking for you.

266
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,480
Hello.

267
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,310
How may I help you?

268
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,040
You shameless bitch,

269
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,920
seducing my husband!

270
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Shame on you!

271
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Everyone, come and see!

272
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,800
Here is a bitch!

273
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,360
What are you doing?

274
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,720
Is there a misunderstanding?

275
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
You shameless bitch!

276
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
What are you doing here?

277
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,440
You are protecting her!

278
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,120
Let's go home and talk about it.

279
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,000
Everyone, come and see!

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Here is a bitch

281
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,840
who seduces other women's husbands!

282
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,320
Just come and see!

283
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,720
Here is a bitch named He Mei!

284
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
Just now,

285
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,480
I talked to the accountant.

286
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,760
Go there

287
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,520
to get your salary later.

288
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
And don't come to work tomorrow.

289
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,040
What do you mean?

290
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,920
Everyone is laughing at you.

291
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,440
Is it fun?

292
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,960
I can't even stay here!

293
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,210
First of all,

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,060
I didn't agree to be your girlfriend.

295
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,040
Second,

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,240
you've never told me

297
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,160
you have a wife.

298
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,400
I have a son to raise.

299
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,160
You are trying to kill me!

300
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,720
Now you know

301
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
my situation.

302
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,000
You don't have to work anymore.

303
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,580
Let me support you.

304
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
Scumbag!

305
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,520
He Mei, are you OK?

306
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,920
You are fired!

307
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Get your salary and piss off!

308
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,360
He Mei.

309
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Madam,

310
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,120
I'll paint the wall soon.

311
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,840
He Mei, I can't rent

312
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,480
my apartment to you any longer.

313
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,520
You brought me

314
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
bad influence.

315
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,640
Pack your things up

316
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,570
and leave here as soon as possible.

317
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,240
But our contract...

318
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
I thought it was not easy for you

319
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
to be a single mom.

320
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,160
But I didn't expect

321
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
you are a home wrecker!

322
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,560
You see, you are a pretty woman.

323
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,020
Why not find a man to marry?

324
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
A person should take the right path.

325
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,340
Just move away.

326
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,840
Are you busy today?

327
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,960
No, what?

328
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,800
I can't ask for leave today.

329
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,880
Can you go to the studio later?

330
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,120
Go and chat with him.

331
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,000
I know.

332
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,960
Just go to work.

333
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,760
Don't be late.

334
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,240
What do you think?

335
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,280
About what?

336
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,720
About what Dad said today

337
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
and Aunt He Mei.

338
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Last time when we met, she told me

339
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,440
that she abandoned me

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,520
for our own good.

341
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,840
In the past,

342
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,770
I always wanted to know the reason.

343
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,020
But after I knew it,

344
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,920
I found the reason

345
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,250
is not important at all.

346
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,170
It is not important?

347
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,960
Because even if you knew the reason,

348
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,760
you couldn't change the result.

349
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,860
She hasn't had a hard life.

350
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,080
She has had a new family

351
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,140
and another child.

352
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,240
She even has never regretted

353
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,440
abandoning me.

354
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
I thought

355
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,920
she might want to meet me,

356
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,120
but later I found

357
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,730
it was my wishful thinking.

358
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,920
Do you know

359
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,240
Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

360
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,040
What is that?

361
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,920
Human needs

362
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,200
are placed from the lowest to the the highest level,

363
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,760
just like a pyramid.

364
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,040
The more basic needs

365
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,320
at the bottom

366
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,980
are physiological needs.

367
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,440
Simply speaking,

368
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
they are the basic things for people to live,

369
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
such as air, water and food.

370
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,610
Didn't our dad say this?

371
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,840
If a man is driven

372
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,280
to desperation,

373
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,090
he won't be considered as a man.

374
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,370
Why can't he be considered as a man?

375
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,680
In order not to be hungry, he has to work

376
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,410
like a horse and be whipped,

377
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,960
and get food

378
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,560
from the trash bin.

379
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,040
For ordinary people,

380
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,560
life is like

381
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
like a box of chocolates.

382
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,440
You never know

383
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
what you're gonna get.

384
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,800
But for people

385
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,080
who are struggling

386
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
at the verge of the poverty line,

387
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
life is like

388
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
a game of Russian roulette.

389
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,560
When you pull the trigger

390
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,360
towards your temple,

391
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,370
you won't get anything.

392
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,200
Or you may get a bullet.

393
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Well. Stop it.

394
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,080
I know.

395
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,160
I don't hate her because of that.

396
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,600
I,

397
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,680
I just think

398
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,040
she doesn't treat me fairly.

399
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,080
How can she treat you fairly?

400
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
She has disappeared for over 20 years,

401
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,640
and now

402
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,440
she is suddenly back to accept you?

403
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,400
Whom are you actually speaking for?

404
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,960
Of course, I'm speaking for you.

405
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,220
I don't want to listen.

406
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,240
Since you don't want to listen, I won't say.

407
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
But you

408
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,480
won't leave me here

409
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,610
and go alone, right?

410
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,120
Ziqiu,

411
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,640
what are you doing?

412
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,000
Just leave me alone.

413
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,680
OK?

414
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,180
Driver, take her to Ningxia Road.

415
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,360
Mom.

416
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,760
Ziqiu.

417
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,760
Ziqiu?

418
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,000
Ziqiu?

419
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,600
Ziqiu?

420
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,120
Ziqiu, where are you?

421
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,320
Ziqiu?

422
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,480
Ziqiu, where are you?

423
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,610
Are you feeling better?

424
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm feeling much better.

425
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,860
Where is Dongdong?

426
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,560
He is asleep.

427
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,360
Don't worry too much.

428
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,360
Here. Have something.

429
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,400
How come

430
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
you ran a high fever?

431
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,840
People get sick.

432
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,760
If Li Haichao didn't send me a WeChat message,

433
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,290
asking me to come to see you,

434
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,400
nobody

435
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,600
would know

436
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,730
when you die at home.

437
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,360
When I was young,

438
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,090
I suffered a lot but didn't die.

439
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,400
If I die because of a fever,

440
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,920
then my life is really

441
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,120
like a joke.

442
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,620
You still have the mood to tell a joke.

443
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,080
Seriously,

444
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,360
Li Haichao is really a good man.

445
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,640
He is forgiving.

446
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,400
But why

447
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,840
didn't you

448
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,480
like him anyway?

449
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,520
Right. Maybe that is fate.

450
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,290
If I agreed to be with him back then,

451
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,420
I wouldn't be like what I am today.

452
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,920
Since you both are single now,

453
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,040
how about you reconsider it?

454
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,000
Perhaps...

455
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,480
Back then, I made him

456
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,520
suffer a lot.

457
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,160
If I have the cheek to be with him,

458
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,840
I'll be really shameless.

459
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,520
If he thinks so,

460
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,100
can he still be good to you?

461
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
He is purely a good man.

462
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,760
He thought I remarried

463
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,290
and gave birth to Dongdong.

464
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
You haven't told him

465
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,760
about Dongdong?

466
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
I'm insignificant.

467
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,650
Why should I tell him those things?

468
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,960
Insignificant?

469
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Then why do you care about Ziqiu?

470
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,760
I owed him too much.

471
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
Mei,

472
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,520
it has been

473
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,160
so many years.

474
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,740
Don't be too hard on yourself.

475
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,040
Hong, you don't understand.

476
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,400
To Ziqiu,

477
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,240
such a thing

478
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,900
is unforgettable in his life.

479
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,680
I owed him a debt.

480
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,680
I can't pay back

481
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,680
or make up for it.

482
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,680
The relationship between us

483
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,250
won't be changed this life.

484
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,400
First, fry it on two sides.

485
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,840
Then, change the oil.

486
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,420
Mr. Ling, you are back.

487
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,080
Where are the others?

488
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,200
It is still too early to have a meal.

489
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,560
They are playing billiards

490
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,440
in the billiards room across the street.

491
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,640
Get the tea for me please.

492
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,280
OK.

493
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,680
Won't you be away on official business

494
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
for half a month?

495
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,400
Why did you come back so soon?

496
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,560
Well.

497
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,640
One of my colleagues

498
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,000
suffered a sudden heart attack

499
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,040
after working there for only two days.

500
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,960
So our leader

501
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
asked all of us,

502
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,000
who are over 50 years old,

503
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,600
to come back to take a rest.

504
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,880
We old fellows

505
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,080
will soon be useless.

506
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,360
So instantly?

507
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,800
I think

508
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
you should take a rest.

509
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,800
You are not

510
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,440
as energetic as those young men in their 20s and 30s.

511
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,900
You shouldn't always work

512
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
in the front line.

513
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,410
People's police serve people.

514
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,880
Zhu is right.

515
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,880
Well,

516
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,720
go to the property management office to pay the property management fee

517
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
and then buy a few bags of salt.

518
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,320
OK.

519
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
When did you

520
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
begin to have presbyopia?

521
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,120
About two years ago.

522
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,560
We are getting old

523
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,840
and we begin to have

524
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,760
health problems.

525
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,200
We should have done something to keep ourselves healthy.

526
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,360
Stop learning how to cook that dish.

527
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,440
Chat with me.

528
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,720
The last process is reduction.

529
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,520
Wait a second.

530
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,400
Stop. Stop.

531
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
What is it that you think

532
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,600
it's not good to say on the phone yesterday

533
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,060
and you insist on talking about face to face?

534
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
There are two things.

535
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,280
One is about Ziqiu

536
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
and the other one is about Ling Xiao.

537
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,290
Which one do you want to hear first?

538
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,370
I want to hear the good thing first.

539
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
The good thing is

540
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,080
Ling Xiao told me

541
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,360
that he and Jianjian...

542
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,520
The two of them.

543
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
What happened to the two of them?

544
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,440
They are in love.

545
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,040
You mean

546
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,320
they are finally in love?

547
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,240
My eyes are faded, while your ears are deaf?

548
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,160
That is a good thing.

549
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,040
Good.

550
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
I've told you, right?

551
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,040
Don't let our own fertile water flow into others' field.

552
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,160
Keep the goodies

553
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,600
within the family.

554
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,780
Look. They are in love, right?

555
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,560
We'll be doubly related.

556
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,410
Well, don't be happy too early.

557
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,040
Of course, I'm happy.

558
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,040
Perhaps they will

559
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,000
break up soon.

560
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,480
What are you talking about?

561
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Look. Jianjian and her ex-boyfriend

562
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,560
got along with each other for only two days

563
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,080
and then they broke up and became friends.

564
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,880
Jianjian and Ling Xiao won't break up.

565
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,810
Even if they want to, I won't agree.

566
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,680
Then what can you do about it?

567
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,720
Can you force them

568
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,440
to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get the marriage certificates?

569
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,640
What do you mean?

570
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,920
They are in love.

571
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
You are not happy about that?

572
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,000
Or do you think my son

573
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,960
doesn't deserve your daughter?

574
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm fully satisfied with Ling Xiao.

575
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,840
But Chen Ting certainly doesn't like

576
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,800
Jianjian.

577
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
She is in Singapore.

578
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,640
She can't do anything about it as she is far away.

579
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,680
In other words,

580
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,080
even if Ling Xiao marries

581
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,960
a princess,

582
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
she won't be satisfied all the same.

583
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,200
Anyway, I won't let my daughter

584
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,520
be bullied by her mother-in-law.

585
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,200
She won't be bullied. You thought too much.

586
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,720
Why do I feel

587
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,840
there is something wrong with this matter?

588
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,000
My son is in love.

589
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,280
But why did he tell you first?

590
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,320
Needless to say,

591
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,600
he is closer to me.

592
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,440
By the way,

593
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,560
Jianjian just told me

594
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
a cold joke.

595
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,440
Question:

596
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,380
Why do we say the father's love is as great as a mountain?

597
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,680
Why?

598
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Because you are motionless.

599
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
You are motionless.

600
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,960
It is funny. Really funny.

601
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,760
I always work outside,

602
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,890
so, I don't have time to accompany him.

603
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
Since you don't have time to accompany him,

604
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,320
don't complain that he is not close to you.

605
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,160
Well. He is not close to me.

606
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,760
He is close to you. Well.

607
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,880
Let's not talk about that.

608
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,360
By the way, tell me about Ziqiu.

609
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
What happened to him?

610
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,640
Ziqiu met his mom.

611
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,210
It was not pleasant.

612
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,260
What happened?

613
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,920
Here is the thing.

614
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,320
That day, He Mei

615
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,520
took her little son with her to come here

616
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,560
to inquire about Ziqu from me.

617
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,080
She just began

618
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,210
to ask about her son.

619
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,720
How could she do that as a mother?

620
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,840
So many years have passed.

621
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,960
Listen to me.

622
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,880
She mainly talked about

623
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,000
what had happened to her.

624
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,490
There is something you don't know.

625
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,780
[Haichao Noodles]

626
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,060
Zhuang Bei,

627
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,840
I'm sorry. I'm late because the meeting delayed me.

628
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,280
It doesn't matter. I wasn't waiting for long.

629
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,880
Take a seat.

630
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,440
OK.

631
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,480
I'm extremely busy recently.

632
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,600
If there is something urgent,

633
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,800
you can call me.

634
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,980
What's the matter?

635
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,200
When I was waiting for you,

636
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,260
I thought about it.

637
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,040
This way

638
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,970
is perhaps more acceptable to you.

639
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,680
So, I typed what I want to say.

640
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
OK. Send it to me.

641
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,210
I'll see whether I can help you.

642
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,520
Mingyue,

643
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,720
at high school,

644
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,250
I didn't take notice of you.

645
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,000
But at our first meeting after so many years,

646
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,060
I fell in love with you at first sight.

647
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,320
I didn't expect that one day,

648
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,380
I could meet the ideal girl in my mind.

649
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,280
You are beautiful, graceful and kind.

650
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
The more I know about you,

651
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,040
the more I like you.

652
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
You finished reading it so quickly?

653
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,620
Perhaps it's a bit sudden.

654
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
Let me tell you

655
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,680
something about my family.

656
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,040
I grew up in Beijing.

657
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,840
During high school,

658
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,800
I came here with my parents.

659
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,480
My dad

660
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
does wholesale business in the seafood market

661
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,240
and my mom is a housewife.

662
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,000
My family has three houses and...

663
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,760
Stop it.

664
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,630
I don't want to know those things.

665
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,150
How about you go back and consider it?

666
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,120
Zhuang Bei, how can you do this?

667
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,230
You know Tang Can likes you

668
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,360
and Tang Can and I are besties,

669
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
but you told me those things.

670
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,320
I have nothing to do with Tang Can.

671
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,630
I've made it clear to her.

672
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,520
Moreover,

673
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,670
the one I always like is you.

674
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,480
Stop it.

675
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,560
You've made things difficult for me.

676
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,920
I always consider you as a senior schoolmate.

677
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,179
I don't want to be your girlfriend at all.

678
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,040
Mingyue.

679
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm sorry.

680
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,630
Is it too sudden?

681
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,760
How about we

682
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,480
try to get along with each other?

683
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,120
I'll make efforts to let you

684
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,560
see my...

685
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,120
No, no. Don't make efforts again.

686
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,320
You'd better make efforts to like Tang Can.

687
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,580
Don't come to me again.

688
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,920
I really feel bad.

689
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,000
Mingyue.

690
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,060
Don't come with me.

691
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,500
[Tang Can]

692
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,640
Tang Can, I'm going back to the office.

693
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,520
What's the matter?

694
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,160
Mingyue,

695
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,280
I was asked to act in a film. I was asked to act in a film.

696
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,200
Really?

697
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,320
Yes.

698
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,080
The producer

699
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,400
called me personally,

700
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
saying that the director thinks I'm the suitable person for the role,

701
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,840
so they want to see me.

702
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
I'll tell you the details when I'm back home.

703
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
I'll go and buy some clothes first.

704
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,200
OK. Go ahead.

705
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,730
Let's talk about it at home.

706
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,760
Great.

707
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,220
I heard Haichao say

708
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,060
you are in love with Jianjian.

709
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm very happy

710
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,020
and supportive of you.

711
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,400
I hope you can have a happy life.

712
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,960
Looking forward to seeing

713
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,890
our two families dear to each other

714
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,720
become a real family.

715
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,900
Thank you, Dad.

716
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,690
Thank you for raising me

717
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
for so many years.

718
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
You will

719
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
have a happy life too.

720
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,000
-Well. Well... -Move the advisor.

721
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,520
You are getting off work?

722
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,880
Yes. Are you going to have supper?

723
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,360
Yes.

724
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,160
Your team will

725
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,240
be on the night shift next week, right?

726
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,720
Yes.

727
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,440
See you tomorrow.

728
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,080
See you tomorrow.

729
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,720
Bye.

730
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,600
I drove here today.

731
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,490
Do you want me to give you a ride?

732
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,080
No need. Someone is waiting for me here.

733
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,920
Miss Feng.

734
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
No wonder Ling Xiao

735
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,160
looks in high spirit

736
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
these days.

737
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,520
From brother and sister to lovers,

738
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,240
did everything go so well with you?

739
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,800
The two of us

740
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
have been on good terms since childhood.

741
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,120
Now we are supported by our family.

742
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,800
Miss Feng, hope you can find your Mr. Right soon.

743
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,720
OK. Thank you.

744
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,920
All the others have people waiting for them,

745
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,240
except me.

746
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,800
I won't be the third wheel.

747
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,200
I parked my car underground. I've got to go.

748
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,840
See you tomorrow.

749
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,200
Bye.

750
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,880
Bye.

751
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,850
Ling Xiao, what are we going to eat?

752
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,660
What do you want to eat?

753
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
Let's have a buffet.

754
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,960
Let's go and wait for Ziqiu to get off work.

755
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,800
Let's not do that today.

756
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,860
Give him some time.

757
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,200
Today I sent him

758
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
WeChat messages all day,

759
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,360
showing my concern for him,

760
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,490
but he didn't reply.

761
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,640
So, let him have some personal space

762
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,840
and don't bother him.

763
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,960
But

764
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,560
should we make him feel

765
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,920
the warmth of family

766
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,320
at this time?

767
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,020
He won't feel warm.

768
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,720
He will only feel

769
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,850
this world is noisy.

770
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,240
Really?

771
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,410
Let's go to have hotpot.

772
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,000
Perhaps I frightened you today.

773
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Can you give me another chance

774
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
so that I can make efforts to win your heart?

775
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,050
I'm going to blacklist you.

776
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,200
You scared me.

777
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,560
How come it's you?

778
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,340
Whom else did you think it was?

779
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,050
You guys talk. I'm going upstairs.

780
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,000
The door is open.

781
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,440
Tell me.

782
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,080
Nobody else is here.

783
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,040
Zhuang bei told Tang Can

784
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,080
that he likes me, not her.

785
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,560
That's too embarrassing.

786
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,200
Right.

787
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
I dare not to go back home now.

788
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,770
How can I explain it to Tang Can?

789
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,760
But,

790
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,360
but you are not to blame for that.

791
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,890
Why don't you dare to say it?

792
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,940
That's easier said than done.

793
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,040
At the time when Ling Xiao

794
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,720
told you he likes you,

795
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,980
did you dare to tell me?

796
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,480
Speaking from my experience,

797
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,080
I don't think you can hide it from her.

798
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Right.

799
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,620
That's why I dare not go back home.

800
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Tang Can is at home.

801
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,660
I have to explain it when I'm back.

802
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,840
I really

803
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,020
don't know how to deal with such a situation.

804
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,280
You know Tang Can

805
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
is in a rare, good mood today, right?

806
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,920
Yes.

807
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
She called me,

808
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,400
telling me that the producer wants to see her.

809
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,800
When she is in a good mood, tell her

810
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,520
and turn a new leaf.

811
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,160
No, no. That's too terrible.

812
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,880
No, no.

813
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,320
Let's go.

814
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,780
Another day. Another day.

815
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,560
Qi Mingyue.

816
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
The door is open.

817
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,400
What can I do?

818
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,040
It'll be fine. I'm with you.

819
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,720
Let's go.
