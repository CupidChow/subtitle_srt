00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:00,020
Go Ahead

3
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,940
Episode 27

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Would you like something else, Mingyue?

5
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,460
No, thanks.

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,810
Add some potato slices.

7
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
This's breaking news,

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,880
isn't it?

9
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,960
What's it? What are you talking about?

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,560
This's breaking news, Miss Li.

11
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,340
If everyone sees this,

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,220
this might cause a sensation.

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,120
Forget it. Forget it.

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
Let's talk about this later.

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,320
There are so many reposts

16
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,920
on Weibo.

17
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
This will be on Hot Search in a while,

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
and we cannot keep it back.

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,640
It's improper for us to bring it up.

20
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,960
What on earth are you talking about?

21
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,320
Share it with us.

22
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,640
You made us impatient.

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,920
Exactly. Come on,

24
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
share it with us.

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Well, Miss Li,

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,720
I'll repost it to the Moments

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,600
with Du Juan's cellphone.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,260
Come on, don't waste our time.

29
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,250
You just know how to waste our time.

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,250
You've reposted it?

31
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,800
So,

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
you are being a two-timing girl, Miss Li.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,460
Have dinner. Let's just have dinner.

34
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
The door is unlocked.

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,620
Come and give me a clear explanation.

36
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,920
What a fool she is!

37
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,170
It's clearly written on the Treehole.

38
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
A family running a noodles restaurant,

39
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
the eldest brother from the neighbor upstairs,

40
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,320
and the second-eldest brother abandoned by his mother,

41
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,520
there's no other group like this.

42
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
I've told her

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
to give her two brothers a clear explanation,

44
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,740
but she keeps delaying it.

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
She's told you this already?

46
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
It turns out that you two have a closer relationship.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,240
Besides, you didn't tell me this

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
since you knew it.

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,560
Don't be annoyed.

50
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,080
Let's go back and talk about this.

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
Let's go. Let's go.

52
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's go.

53
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,840
Though the two of you are not related by blood,

54
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,920
you are supposed to be real siblings

55
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,280
as you grew up in the same family.

56
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
How can you hold this kind of feeling towards her?

57
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,480
You are talking about

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
what happened

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,850
after my mom married to Dad.

60
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
In fact, however,

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Li Jianjian and I

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,800
are not

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,840
real sister and brother.

64
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,600
In that case,

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
what's the difference between you and me?

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Didn't my dad treat you

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
as his own son?

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
You just didn't sleep in our home.

69
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
Didn't you treat each other as brother and sister?

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,280
I took Li Jianjian

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
back from bad guys myself

72
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,440
when we were young.

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
All the neighbors saw

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,159
that Li Jianjian served a cup of tea to my dad

75
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,120
and we bowed to Heaven and Earth.

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,640
It was just like a parental betrothal, wasn't it?

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
A parental betrothal?

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,120
You are talking nonsense now.

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,920
What about me?

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,250
I'm a child bridegroom!

81
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I slept with Li Jianjian

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
on the same bed when we were little.

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,600
If that counts,

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
we should be destined to die

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,940
if we are not together?

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,600
If you think so,

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,560
I have nothing to say.

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
How about you go back and ask Mr. Li

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,760
whether he has treated you as his son

90
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,280
or son-in-law?

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,200
Shut up!

92
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
You should ask your mom

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,520
if she would agree

94
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,400
that you are with Li Jianjian.

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,120
Who I'm with

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,840
is not up to my mother,

97
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,680
but only up

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,080
to both parties concerned.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
OK, both parties concerned,

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,240
that's great.

101
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,210
I'm telling you,

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
Li Jianjian doesn't hold that kind of feeling

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
towards neither of us.

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,780
She treats us both as her elder brothers.

105
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,200
She just doesn't hold that kind of feeling towards you.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
Wake up!

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,840
You wake up!

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,200
We are already together,

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,730
but we haven't told you yet.

110
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,690
The two of you are together?

111
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,760
He has a hallucination, doesn't he,

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,490
Li Jianjian?

113
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,520
You two are together indeed?

114
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,100
You didn't treat him as your brother?

115
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,980
Not really.

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,159
Ziqiu...

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Since both Ling Xiao and I are your brothers,

118
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,000
why did you choose him rather than me?

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,130
Don't pressure her.

120
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,860
You care about her so much?

121
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
I was just asking her.

122
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,140
Was that putting pressure on her?

123
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm wondering

124
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,380
why everyone abandons me.

125
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,680
When did you sneak into our room?

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,240
Life is boring.

127
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,360
Boring.

128
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,440
Boring.

129
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,720
Why did the daytime come so soon?

130
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,520
Whatever happened yesterday,

131
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,920
the sun rises today as usual.

132
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
If only I can stay in this room

133
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,240
for a lifetime.

134
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
What happened to you

135
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,880
is not embarrassing.

136
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,160
It is the one you didn't choose

137
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,560
that is pathetic, right?

138
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,520
Why did you choose Ling Xiao?

139
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,010
Ziqiu was not born with a silver spoon,

140
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,480
but he's the better one.

141
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
If she

142
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
chose He Ziqiu,

143
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,100
then Ling Xiao would be pathetic.

144
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,690
Besides, what's wrong with Ling Xiao?

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,880
Ling Xiao is nice,

146
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
but a relationship

147
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
involves two families.

148
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,200
If she chose He Ziqiu,

149
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,200
she wouldn't need to worry

150
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,000
about having to get along with her mother-in-law.

151
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,120
That makes sense.

152
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
If I were a man,

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,170
I would choose Li Jianjian too.

154
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
Even you wouldn't choose me.

155
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
How would I choose you?

156
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,880
With your mom and mine

157
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,160
being there,

158
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,800
if we marry,

159
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,680
our marriage won't last as long as three years.

160
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
By then we have to strive for the custody of our children,

161
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,600
and my mom won't give in.

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,650
Neither will my mother.

163
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,500
That's enough.

164
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,320
Both of you are women.

165
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,520
Mingyue,

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
let's be love rats together.

167
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,080
Let's go have noodles at the gate of the community.

168
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,760
No.

169
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,960
Let's go to Li Jianjian's family restaurant.

170
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,120
I'd like to have noodles Jianjian's father makes.

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,580
Let's make it in a few days.

172
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,280
Good morning.

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,720
Have your breakfast now, or it will be cold.

174
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Thank you.

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,650
Sorry to have bothered you.

176
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,560
How about you have breakfast before you leave?

177
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
No, thanks. I have something to do later.

178
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,960
Well, go ahead.

179
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,200
Ziqiu...

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,640
What's up?

181
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,640
Stop being mad at me.

182
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,080
I wasn't.

183
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,050
Why do I have to be mad at you?

184
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,850
Your boyfriend is here.

185
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,320
Good morning.

186
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,780
I don't want to talk to you!

187
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,100
Let's have breakfast.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,960
What Weibo post?

189
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,640
It can't be about me.

190
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
There're quite a few families

191
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,220
whose situation are similar to ours, right?

192
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,440
It's not me, indeed.

193
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,560
I have to hang up.

194
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Someone comes to my studio. Bye bye.

195
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,680
Is it obviously me?

196
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,330
Who was that?

197
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
A high-school classmate of mine

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,130
that we haven't been in touch for long.

199
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,960
Not a second family

200
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
like yours

201
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
can be found

202
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
all over China.

203
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,840
I know you must be

204
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,000
very anxious about this,

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,840
but I have to say

206
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,440
that I might be quite hesitant

207
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,920
if I were you.

208
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Since the two brothers are excellent,

209
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,540
which of them should I choose?

210
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
You should choose Ziqiu, of course.

211
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,480
Why?

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,060
His family is rich,

213
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
so you should choose the richer one

214
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
to marry.

215
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,130
Though Ling Xiao

216
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,000
will be very rich as a dentist

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
in the future,

218
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,400
he's no match

219
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,760
for a wealthy family.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,680
But Ling Xiao looks handsome.

221
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,200
He can't charm his way through life.

222
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,880
But you look so handsome,

223
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm not hungry

224
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,320
once I look at you.

225
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,440
That's enough of you.

226
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,560
Li Jianjian?

227
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,620
We've received our minimum licensing payment.

228
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
Let me see.

229
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,280
So soon.

230
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,400
I thought it would take a month.

231
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,200
That's great.

232
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,480
We got money!

233
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,960
We got money!

234
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,640
I'll buy

235
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,800
the limited-edition sneakers for you.

236
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,930
Thank you, darling.

237
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
But I think

238
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,440
we should spend

239
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,240
some of the money

240
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,160
on promotion.

241
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
Du Juan, could you please

242
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,240
give me my part of the money?

243
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm in urgent need of it.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm transferring the money to you now.

245
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,320
Well...

246
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,960
did you hear

247
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,040
what I said?

248
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,600
Looks like you don't know

249
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
the importance of promotion.

250
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,520
If we want

251
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,240
to expand our business

252
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,520
we must...

253
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Zhou Miao.

254
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,920
Yes, Boss?

255
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,920
If I hear you

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,280
talk about this again in the future,

257
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,810
I'll fire you, understood?

258
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,680
Yes.

259
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,520
Good.

260
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,210
Go on with your work.

261
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,760
Don't eat any candy

262
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,960
or sleep with a candy bar in your mouth

263
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,490
once you finish brushing your teeth at night,

264
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,440
OK.

265
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,920
Get off.

266
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,760
Remember

267
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,720
what Mr. Dentist told you.

268
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,640
You should use that mouthwash

269
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,960
after finishing your dinner.

270
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,680
I got it.

271
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,130
Look at this, Ling Xiao.

272
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
Li Jianjian posted this article on the Treehole,

273
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,600
didn't she?

274
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,020
It is about you, right?

275
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,080
No.

276
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm definitely and absolutely sure.

277
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,720
So this is

278
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,040
what happened to your family.

279
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
Well, since you were back from Singapore,

280
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,930
what about your mom?

281
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,960
If I were you,

282
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,280
I would pretend to know

283
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,880
nothing about this.

284
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,960
But I'm too excited to hold myself.

285
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,640
Your experience

286
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,770
is quite wonderful.

287
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,960
I don't think it's wonderful

288
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,160
that my parents divorced,

289
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,400
my work-occupied dad entrusted his neighbor

290
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,520
to take care of me

291
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,880
and I went to Singapore

292
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,800
to look after my mom who had a car accident

293
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
after graduating from high school.

294
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,680
At least

295
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,600
I myself don't think

296
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,930
this experience can be called wonderful.

297
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,860
Well...

298
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,120
Ling Xiao?

299
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,940
Hello, Mom.

300
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,840
Ling Xiao,

301
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm looking for

302
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,960
the pineapple tart store near your university.

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,480
Where the hell is it?

304
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,560
Take a turn

305
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,400
from the beef noodle restaurant at the interaction,

306
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,460
and you will see it.

307
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,920
OK, I got it.

308
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,120
Fine, I'm hanging up.

309
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,760
Goodbye.

310
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,380
[Xiaomei]

311
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,160
Hello?

312
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,920
What's up?

313
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,089
How is Mom recently?

314
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,480
She's just as usual.

315
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,020
What else could she be?

316
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,589
But she's

317
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,720
a little better now.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,599
She seems to be in a good mood.

319
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,589
Yesterday she invited her friends to dinner,

320
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,200
and she goes shopping today.

321
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,210
She's almost spent all of the family fortune.

322
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,760
You are on holiday, right?

323
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,440
Don't provoke her at home.

324
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Behave yourself,

325
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
and don't go out

326
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,720
playing with your classmates every day.

327
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,600
You got that?

328
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,120
I got it! Stop nagging.

329
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
How about you try and take care of her?

330
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,880
Goodbye.

331
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Here's the dessert for you as a gift.

332
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,560
You are quite generous.

333
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
That's quite unusual.

334
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,400
Don't be too touched.

335
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,060
This was left from yesterday.

336
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,180
Help yourself.

337
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,400
Ziqiu.

338
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,560
Are you OK?

339
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,660
Nothing wrong with me.

340
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,440
I'm fine.

341
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,240
Good, I'm just asking.

342
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm afraid you might get yourself into a dead end.

343
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,560
If you are here to laugh at me,

344
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,020
get lost as fast as you can.

345
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,120
How can you

346
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,160
do that to me, He Ziqiu?

347
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,820
I'm just caring about you, OK?

348
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
I have a rendezvous with someone here

349
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,520
so that your shop will look prosperous,

350
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,080
or your store

351
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,760
might close down by then.

352
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
Well, I'm sorry for disappointing you.

353
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,240
I can keep my store running.

354
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,960
Besides, my new products

355
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,360
will be on sale very soon.

356
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,400
Here I am, Mingyue.

357
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,840
You have an appointment with her?

358
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,700
Can't I do that?

359
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,940
Zhuang Bei.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,760
I invited him here to provide legal consultation.

361
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,120
All right, what would you like to drink?

362
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
I've ordered an ice latte.

363
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,560
OK, you go on with your talk,

364
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,760
and I'm going to work.

365
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,900
Take a seat.

366
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,840
Zhuang Bei, I have an appointment

367
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,600
with Ms. Liu at 2:00 p.m.

368
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Is that OK with you?

369
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,640
Of course not,

370
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,720
I can work on my paperwork here.

371
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
Well,

372
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,320
I haven't finished my draft yet.

373
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,120
Mingyue,

374
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,520
Ziqiu looks quite calm

375
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,440
after Li Jianjian

376
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,920
chose Ling Xiao,

377
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,880
do you think so?

378
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Yeah, he looks as if nothing has happened.

379
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,160
He came over to our room

380
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
and made breakfast for us in the morning.

381
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,040
Yeah.

382
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,840
Anyway,

383
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,520
Uncle Li is also his father,

384
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,400
so he wouldn't fall out with Jianjian

385
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,920
because Jianjian didn't choose him.

386
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,200
As the old saying goes,

387
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,600
a man's weakness

388
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,450
is only shown late in the night.

389
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,960
But they've grown up together,

390
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,300
how come he has such a kind of feeling?

391
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,040
I think

392
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,760
he can't see anyone else

393
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
just because

394
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,850
they've grown up together.

395
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,680
Yep.

396
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,800
Seeing him restrain himself like this,

397
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,120
I feel sorry for him.

398
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,800
It's OK, he's a man.

399
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,530
Given some time, he'll be fine.

400
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,700
Here's your latte.

401
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Thank you.

402
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,280
Help yourselves once your paperwork is finished.

403
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,080
I've got to go.

404
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,540
See you at home.

405
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,240
A facial massage can only promote blood circulation

406
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,300
and increase the elasticity of skin,

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
but it won't get rid

408
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,320
of wrinkles.

409
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,840
Twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye.

410
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,650
I always thought

411
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,280
that it was yesterday

412
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,140
when I worked as a shop assistant.

413
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,800
I've never thought that I would be getting old.

414
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,680
When we were young, we might thought

415
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,080
that we wouldn't get old.

416
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
When I saw Ziqiu that day,

417
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,440
I found that

418
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,840
we are really aged women.

419
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
He's a nice boy,

420
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,040
just like you.

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,060
Don't mention him.

422
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,560
Mei,

423
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,760
you are not going to

424
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,400
recognize Ziqiu as your son again?

425
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,930
I don't think he holds the grudge against you.

426
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Li Haichao brought him up

427
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,560
with great efforts,

428
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,360
it would be a shame for me to get him back.

429
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,960
You see the consequence

430
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,320
of Zhao Huaguang?

431
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
A man cannot be greedy.

432
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,960
But there was no way out for you

433
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,000
back then.

434
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,800
You left him there for his sake,

435
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
didn't you?

436
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,490
No one will believe in this.

437
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,940
You are so tough

438
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
and sturdy.

439
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,680
At this age,

440
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,680
we look older than the young.

441
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
You don't have to make it hard for yourself.

442
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,760
If you think you are old,

443
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
just talk about yourself.

444
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
I don't think I'm old,

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,200
and I didn't make it hard for myself either.

446
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,120
Besides,

447
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
Dongdong is still young,

448
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
so I have to do my best to raise him.

449
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,960
You never know

450
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,000
how to give in

451
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
or yield.

452
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,080
Hello?

453
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,650
Are you Dongdong's mom?

454
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,800
Come here right now.

455
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,560
Dongdong bit his classmate.

456
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,560
OK, I'll be right there.

457
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,040
What's up?

458
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,560
I have to go to the kindergarten

459
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
Dongdong studies in.

460
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,240
Madam,

461
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
we reached an agreement before.

462
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
If Dongdong attacks others

463
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,200
without any reason again,

464
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,520
we can't keep him

465
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
in our kindergarten anymore.

466
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,760
Dongdong won't

467
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,020
attack other children

468
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,540
as long as they don't snatch his toys.

469
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,560
But these children are still young,

470
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,520
how can we prevent them

471
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,720
from snatching toys?

472
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,460
Even teachers cannot keep an eye on them.

473
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
Now the parents of other children

474
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,440
feel dissatisfied

475
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,560
with our kindergarten.

476
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,400
We have to

477
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,060
keep other children safe too.

478
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
Yeah, but...

479
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,960
Madam,

480
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,960
honestly, I suggest you

481
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,720
send Dongdong

482
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,450
to a special education school.

483
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,200
Dongdong was not born autistic,

484
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
and I've been taking him

485
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,140
to see psychologists.

486
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,320
I understand.

487
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
Well, please don't bring Dongdong here

488
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,260
until he's mentally healthy.

489
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,240
For Dongdong,

490
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,320
being in a kindergarten

491
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,920
where he doesn't feel secure

492
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,010
might only worsen his illness.

493
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
What's wrong, Dongdong?

494
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,400
It's OK, Dongdong.

495
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,320
Let's go have a rest at home for a few days.

496
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,480
We'll be back later, OK?

497
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,130
Put your arms around me.

498
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,520
Good boy.

499
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,540
[Experimental Kindergarten]

500
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
You are Wang Mingxia, right?

501
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Li Xiaoqiang is the defendant.

502
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
This is your indictment.

503
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,680
And this is the compensation for mental damage,

504
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,400
which is 50,000 yuan.

505
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,320
If you have no question about this,

506
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,520
that's all for today.

507
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,920
OK.

508
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,280
Thank you.

509
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,160
You are welcome.

510
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,760
Thank you.

511
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,090
You are welcome.

512
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
This way, please.

513
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,740
Don't bother to see me out.

514
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,320
Mingyue,

515
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
it's so nice of you.

516
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,000
You helped them

517
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,330
both on and off the show.

518
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,280
No wonder my mom

519
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,640
likes your show so much.

520
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
She always says that the reporters of your TV station

521
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,100
are beautiful and kind-hearted.

522
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
That's my duty.

523
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,400
Li Jianjian told me

524
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,240
that you planned to study law too

525
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,200
in your high school days.

526
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,560
We almost became colleagues.

527
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
I wanted to study journalism,

528
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,760
while my mom expected me to study law.

529
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,240
However, I failed in the college entrance examination

530
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,640
and just got less than 550 points

531
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,360
because I was stressed out.

532
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
You passed the first tier standard?

533
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes,

534
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,880
but my mom wanted me to retake high school courses.

535
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,520
I told her that I felt stressed

536
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,000
as soon as I entered the examination room,

537
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,120
so retaking courses wouldn't work out.

538
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,320
Finally, she gave in

539
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,280
and said I should either study journalism

540
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,960
in this city

541
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,880
or retake courses

542
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,610
without going out of this city.

543
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,920
All parents

544
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,040
hope their children

545
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,800
to stay with them.

546
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,000
That's quite normal.

547
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,130
You were forced to return here too?

548
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,880
No.

549
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,880
My parents are glad to see I make decisions on my own.

550
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,640
I made up the decision

551
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,040
to stay with them myself.

552
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,920
When I was young,

553
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,760
my dad ran his business out there,

554
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,640
while my mom had to take care of the family.

555
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,560
Life was hard for both of them.

556
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,040
When they are old,

557
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,370
I hope to stay with them.

558
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,520
It's really nice of your parents.

559
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,480
In my family,

560
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,040
my mom is the boss.

561
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,720
At the beginning, my mom just wanted me

562
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,960
to distinguish myself.

563
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,480
However, after I failed in the college entrance examination,

564
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,760
she gave this up,

565
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,920
and just wanted me to stay with her,

566
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,000
hoping me to get married

567
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,640
and have children early.

568
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,920
I'm just 25,

569
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,880
but she is finding men

570
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,920
for me to date.

571
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,680
You went to date them?

572
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,560
Yes, I had to, OK?

573
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,700
Why did you have a detour to pick me up?

574
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,360
In the future, I'll pick you up every day,

575
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:10,920
OK?

576
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,480
Looks like you are in a good mood today.

577
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,880
Anything good happened?

578
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,280
Tell me.

579
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,280
If you don't tell me,

580
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,040
I won't know what you are thinking about.

581
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,920
When I met you when we were little, you looked depressed,

582
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,520
and those wild children said

583
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,380
that a devil possessed your body.

584
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,490
Nothing good happened.

585
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
I just think

586
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,240
it's like a dream

587
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
that I can see you here

588
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,280
after work.

589
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,520
You are quite good at love talks.

590
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,840
Tell me the truth,

591
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
have you had any girlfriend?

592
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Of course not.

593
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,690
How about ordinary girl friends you get on well with?

594
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,050
You have one?

595
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,020
Yeah, there is one.

596
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,240
She's my classmate in university,

597
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
and she's from Xiamen too.

598
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
To start with, we felt close to each other

599
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
because we are fellow-townsmen.

600
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,560
Later we became friends.

601
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,960
She helped me a lot.

602
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,380
She helped you?

603
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,960
Sometimes she helped me answer the roll call in class.

604
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
Sometimes she also helped me

605
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,520
search information for the group assignments.

606
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,120
Tell me something

607
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,360
about your university days.

608
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,690
I know nothing about it.

609
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,680
But I know a lot

610
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,730
about yours.

611
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,680
I didn't have any boyfriend

612
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
when I was in university.

613
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,960
I didn't mean this.

614
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,880
Is the spicy hot pot vendor

615
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,720
still there

616
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,440
near the gate of your university?

617
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:24,880
Yes.

618
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,210
How do you know that?

619
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,600
Qi Mingyue told you that.

620
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,130
Besides,

621
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,280
you planted a tree in your university,

622
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,040
didn't you?

623
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,370
It's supposed to have grown up, right?

624
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
You must be an immortal.

625
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,370
Let's go.

626
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,640
It's been so tall.

627
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,000
You are seven years old,

628
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,800
and you are no longer a baby tree.

629
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,240
How could your tree

630
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,500
become a wishing tree?

631
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,360
Look, these trees around

632
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,840
were planted at the same time

633
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
when I was in my freshman year.

634
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,480
Among them, my tree

635
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,810
is the best and lushest.

636
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,080
There's a tradition in our university

637
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,360
that the best one

638
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,520
of the same group of trees planted

639
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,240
means it's energetic and lucky.

640
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,760
So

641
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,520
they would take it

642
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,600
as a wishing tree.

643
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,640
I only know you can take good care of people,

644
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,760
but I didn't expect

645
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,600
you could also take good care of this tree.

646
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
The sapling was good.

647
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
When I was young,

648
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,850
my dad taught me how to pick samplings.

649
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,200
You fertilized it in spring and autumn,

650
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,840
and watered it when there was no rain.

651
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
Qi Mingyue said

652
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,760
you treated this tree

653
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,720
as your son.

654
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,240
I like trees so much.

655
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,320
It is quiet when it's alive.

656
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,440
However, when it is dead

657
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
and turns into a block of wood one day,

658
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
I'll carve it

659
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
into a tree that can remain forever.

660
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
You want to accomplish

661
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
a long-term performance art related to time?

662
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,020
You could say that.

663
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,060
What are you doing?

664
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,680
Since I see a wishing tree, of course I'm making a wish.

665
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,410
You've never done this before.

666
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,040
When we were watching

667
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,200
the meteor shower,

668
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,880
Ziqiu made a wish,

669
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
but you thought he was naive.

670
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,840
The older one grows, the more superstitious he will become.

671
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,960
You are superstitious, aren't you?

672
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,520
No.

673
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,200
I've been superstitious since I was young.

674
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,000
So simple.

675
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,080
You thought I would write

676
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,640
"May our love last forever"?

677
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,200
That's not simple.

678
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,530
That's old-fashioned.

679
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,340
What are you doing?

680
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,680
Put me down!

681
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,360
We are in the university,

682
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,620
and there're security guards on patrol.

683
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
You know how short you are?

684
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm not short.

685
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,850
I'm 5 feet 4 inches tall.

686
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Tell me the truth.

687
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,050
All right, I'm 5 feet 3 inches tall.

688
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,280
So what?

689
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,200
Is that bothering you?

690
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,880
Yes.

691
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
But how?

692
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,640
♫You are...you are♫

693
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,880
♫My everything in life♫

694
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,480
♫You are...you are♫

695
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,320
♫Never let go♫

696
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,760
♫When I am down you pick me off the ground♫

697
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,920
♫Now my heart is verified♫

698
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,920
♫You are♫

699
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,760
That's all?

700
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,890
Don't stare at me like that.

701
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,160
♫You are...you are♫

702
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,400
♫My everything in life♫

703
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,960
♫You are...you are♫

704
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,840
♫Never let go♫

705
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,280
♫There will be nothing I would ever trade♫

706
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,920
♫My love ain't never fade♫

707
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,220
You are still mad at me?

708
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,410
I won't tease you again.

709
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,610
You despise me as I'm short.

710
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,100
I didn't mean that.

711
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,960
I just thought

712
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,120
it might be bad for my neck

713
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,180
as you are so short.

714
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
All right, next time

715
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,840
you can talk to me on your knees

716
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,400
and it will be bad for my neck instead.

717
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,130
OK, I can get down on my knees...

718
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,970
once I buy a ring.

719
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,720
Cut it out.

720
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
As we've been together

721
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
for just a few days,

722
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,360
don't talk about

723
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,960
anything serious like this.

724
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,160
Say something relaxing.

725
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,880
The dishes here

726
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,210
are quite yummy, right?

727
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,560
These are Qi Mingyue's favorite.

728
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,480
Though we were not in the same school

729
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
during our university days,

730
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,560
we always came here

731
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,760
when we had a reunion.

732
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,560
The dishes here taste very good

733
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,620
and are very cheap.

734
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,640
Right?

735
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,060
Let's bring Ziqiu here in the future.

736
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,490
You should keep a distance from him

737
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,660
when you get along with each other in the future.

738
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,560
Got it.

739
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,920
Ling Xiao,

740
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,480
we should also keep a distance from each other

741
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,210
in front of Ziqiu in the future.

742
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,840
Why?

743
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,640
I'm afraid that he might not come to terms with this

744
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,700
for the time being.

745
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
If he can't come to terms with this, just leave him alone

746
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,120
and let him take this on his own.

747
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,650
We cannot be so cruel to him.

748
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,780
Or you want to make a choice again?

749
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,730
You want him?

750
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,880
Why are you so sensitive?

751
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,760
If you have mercy on me, just go ahead till the end.

752
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,840
Don't show your mercy on whoever

753
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,120
is more pathetic, OK?

754
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,970
What do you mean by this?

755
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,780
Who are you despising?

756
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,720
You've never shown mercy

757
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,480
on me at all?

758
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,880
Ling Xiao!

759
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,480
What do you mean?

760
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,360
Cut it out, OK?

761
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,800
I know why Zheng Shuran

762
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
broke up with you.

763
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,760
How about we verify it again?

764
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,240
Verify it?

765
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,480
I don't want to kiss you at all

766
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,940
under this circumstance.

767
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,840
It doesn't matter if you don't want to.

768
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,600
In consideration of our relationship for a dozen of years,

769
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
we've already been like a family

770
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,199
whose bond is tighter than love.

771
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,330
Just stay together with me.

772
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,050
I don't care.

773
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,880
But I do.

774
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
How could you think like this?

775
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,600
What do you want me to think?

776
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,480
If I didn't like you,

777
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,080
I wouldn't have promised

778
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,120
to be with you.

779
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,710
You said you would get hold of me

780
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,760
if I fell off.

781
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,920
That's different.

782
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,320
I know that's different.

783
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,400
If I hadn't forced you to accept me,

784
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
would you have chosen me?

785
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,000
You can live

786
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,130
very well on your own

787
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,760
because you have many friends,

788
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,960
but I can't because I don't have friends.

789
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,360
You must stay by my side.

790
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm not the only one in your life,

791
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,240
Ling Xiao.

792
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,600
Don't you have anything else

793
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,720
you like to do?

794
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,640
What did you do

795
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,120
in Singapore

796
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,640
apart from taking care

797
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,120
of your mom and sister

798
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,530
and attending classes?

799
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,050
I missed you,

800
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,940
missed our family,

801
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,020

haven't you?

00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,080
Shame on you to say that.

861
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,040
Everyone has his dignity,

862
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,560
but you turn against us

863
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,680
and help others

864
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,600
in secret.

865
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,490
You should be more careful, OK?

866
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,760
Have you got back the money

867
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,040
you lent to your ex-boyfriend

868
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,200
without telling us?

869
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,010
Li Jianjian?

870
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,040
The two of you

871
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,480
are so close to each other now

872
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,610
that you even took him to see your tree.

873
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,960
How sweet!

874
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,640
You seem to be sleepwalking.

875
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,880
Why do you want to know

876
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,680
what happened to Ling Xiao in Singapore for no reason?

877
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,040
If you do want to know that,

878
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,080
just go ask him.

879
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,840
I think my brother Ling Xiao

880
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,400
is a little mentally unhealthy.

881
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,920
Indeed Ling Xiao

882
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,250
is mentally unhealthy.

883
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,800
You have sharp ears!

884
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm telling you,

885
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
one might be embarrassed

886
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,020
to chat with others

887
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,240
if he or she

888
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,770
isn't mentally unhealthy.

889
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,520
But I think

890
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,280
Ziqiu is the one who's mentally unhealthy.

891
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,800
You chose Ling Xiao, and he felt so frustrated.

892
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
I met him at the door

893
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,800
when I came back.

894
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,080
He was drunk.

895
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,240
He didn't come back

896
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,360
until you were back?

897
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,400
No. I had an appointment

898
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,640
with Zhuang Bei in Ziqiu's coffee shop

899
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,880
to provide legal consultation

900
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,600
for that woman who suffered domestic violence.

901
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,640
But he wasn't in the shop in the afternoon.

902
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640
His shop assistant said that their business has been bad in recent days.

903
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,080
Jianjian,

904
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,120
you are still staying up so late?

905
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,720
Jianjian?

906
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,760
Speak.

907
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,320
Dad.

908
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
What's wrong?

909
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,240
Why are you so low-spirited?

910
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,570
It's like you're dying.

911
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,880
I took a hit.

912
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,570
Tell me. What happened?

913
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Well...

914
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,280
Well...

915
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I can't tell you now.

916
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,240
I'll tell you later.

917
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,460
You're keeping it secret from me?

918
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,240
Then why did you call me?

919
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,720
I need to be encouraged to face it.

920
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,000
I need you to cheer me on

921
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,660
like refueling a car with gas.

922
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,080
You need me to

923
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,560
refuel your car?

924
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,480
Don't you

925
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,010
run a gas station yourself?

926
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,440
Don't our whole family

927
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,300
always go to your place to refuel?

928
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,560
My gas station is running out of gas now.
