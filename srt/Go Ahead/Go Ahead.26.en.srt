00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
Go Ahead

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Episode 26

4
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
When I was the most embarrassed,

5
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,910
you accepted and supported me,

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
and I was really touched.

7
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,920
But later on,

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
what I fear the most

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
is your support.

10
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,920
Do you know how I feel

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,840
when you encourage me

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
after I fail an audition

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
every time?

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,320
Your comforting looks

15
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,560
make me feel

16
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,160
like a completely loser

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,240
and I feel so ashamed.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,760
I fail all the time

19
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
like a joke!

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
So you'll be happier

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
if we do nothing about it?

22
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,840
To a winner,

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,079
even if someone spits on them,

24
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,540
it's because of jealousy.

25
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
To a loser,

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
even if someone applauds for them,

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,240
it still feels like a slap in the face.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
The more you encourage me,

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
the more it makes me feel

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,120
that I'm not cut out for it.

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Don't say that.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,500
You started acting since childhood.

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,440
A man at five may be a fool at fifteen.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,400
Doesn't your mother always say that?

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,960
Does your mother really

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
hate me so much?

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,360
She calls me a jobless

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,600
every time she comes here.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
She knows that I'm allergic to that sauce,

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
but she still brings it here every time.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,120
Didn't you tell your mother

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,160
that you gave that sauce made by your grandma

43
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
to your colleagues?

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,360
If you really think you can't do it,

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
why do you still go to the auditions?

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,210
You're being very contradictory.

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
You keep saying that you can't do it,

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,940
but still you keep trying.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,680
I just don't want you to know it!

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,720
And I don't want to be embarrassed, so what?

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
You don't fail all the time.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
But you refused some of it

53
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,600
because it was a small part!

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
That's because it was just like the extras!

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,280
Even my mother would feel ashamed of me.

56
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
What's to be ashamed of?

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,200
What kind of movies

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
would have

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,170
only the leading roles?

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,000
What do you know?

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
You have such a promising career

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,520
and Mingyue is doing

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,000
a journalist job that she likes.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,079
But what about me?

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
I fail the auditions all the time

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
and the money I make by running a Taobao store

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
can't even afford my life!

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
Even my snacks

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
are bought by you!

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,000
It's not you who has accomplished nothing!

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Tang Can...

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,040
I understand that you feel it's unfair,

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,160
but Tang Can,

74
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
we're your best friends,

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
not your punching bags

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,200
or your enemies!

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Your enemy right now

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
is yourself!

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,360
Jianjian!

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
I don't want to talk to her anymore!

81
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,240
This is so annoying!

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,970
Li Jianjian!

83
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,160
You're unbelievable!

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm a lawyer,

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,800
but you and Ziqiu still feel worried

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,730
about the contract that I've verified for Jianjian.

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,720
Right on time. Come and sign the contract.

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,450
Where are Tang Can and Mingyue?

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,520
Zhuang Bei, you are here.

90
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,540
What are you two doing?

91
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,300
Nothing, just joking around.

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
I want to tell you something.

93
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,240
Then let's go out alone.

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,880
You two...

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,720
Hello.

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Mingyue.

97
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,960
It's nothing serious.

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,360
I can tell you right here.

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Here is the thing.

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,600
Last time, you sent my mother a necklace

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,360
to save her face

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,440
when you were

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
playing mahjong with her, right?

104
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
I wanted to give you the money,

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,520
but I don't think it's appropriate,

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,920
so I bought you one of exactly the same type.

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,360
What's wrong?

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,280
You should have told her about this

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,720
when you two are alone.

110
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,160
But it's not a big deal

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,840
and we don't

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,440
see each other alone

113
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,360
that much.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,620
You're unbelievable!

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
How could you do that to my friend?

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,970
You're too much!

117
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,920
I'll go and check on her.

118
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Then I'm leaving now.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
OK. Take care.

120
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
What's wrong?

121
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,850
Quarreled with Tang Can again?

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm holding back

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,900
the most hurtful words to her.

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,520
It's very mature of you

125
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
to hold back the most hurtful words

126
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,640
when you're quarrelling with someone.

127
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,680
She's the oldest

128
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,760
among the three of us,

129
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,360
but she's not mature at all!

130
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,320
She always loses her temper with me

131
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
and she's the most immature!

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
But you still defended her just now.

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,290
I think there's one thing great

134
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,520
about Tang Can.

135
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,200
Pretty?

136
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,560
Simple-minded.

137
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,120
You can tell if she's happy or not

138
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
from her face.

139
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,760
She's straightforward.

140
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,159
Is that really a compliment?

141
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,500
Hello, Mom.

142
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
It's in the transparent box

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,680
in the third drawer

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,540
in the hallway of the living room.

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,970
I've had dinner.

146
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,900
I was chatting with Jianjian.

147
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Let me say a few words with Jianjian.

148
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
I don't think it's a good idea.

149
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,800
Why?

150
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
My mom wants to talk with you.

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,520
Hurry up.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Jianjian,

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,760
hello, this is Chen Ting.

154
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,200
Hello, Ma'am.

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,200
How are you?

156
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
I'm fine.

157
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,440
I can take care

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
of myself now.

159
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
How is your father?

160
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
He's fine.

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,760
Thank you for asking.

162
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,560
I heard

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,159
that Ling Xiao

164
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,880
rented an apartment opposite yours, right?

165
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,560
Since you can take care of each other now,

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,520
I'm relieved.

167
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
If there's nothing else, that's it.

168
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
See you next time. Bye!

169
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,520
Bye.

170
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,400
What made your mother change so much?

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,200
I don't know.

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
Maybe she has figured it out by herself.

173
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,680
I've thought about the problem

174
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
with your mother.

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,770
What do you mean?

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,000
Neither your mother nor your sister like me,

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,320
so if they know we're together,

178
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
they will definitely be against it.

179
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
If we tell them about our relationship,

180
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,680
it'll be like

181
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
Mars hitting the earth.

182
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,280
Do you care so much about their opinions?

183
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
It doesn't matter whether I care or not.

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
The important thing is

185
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
that it exists objectively.

186
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
I was worried

187
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
that you wouldn't think

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
about our future.

189
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,010
But it turned out you had thought so much about it.

190
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,720
By the way,

191
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
when did you start

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,180
to have this kind of feelings towards me?

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,360
Very long ago, when we were in high school.

194
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,040
So I didn't let you go into my room.

195
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
That was early-maturing!

196
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,740
You're being late-maturing.

197
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,200
What if I got married

198
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
when you were

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,680
in Singapore?

200
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,780
I thought about it.

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,680
If you got married,

202
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,660
I would wait for you

203
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
to get a divorce,

204
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
or

205
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,850
I can take care of your kids.

206
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,410
If you didn't get a divorce,

207
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,320
I would be your big brother all my life.

208
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
You would wait for me?

209
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,560
That sounds pathetic.

210
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,140
There're good girls everywhere.

211
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,440
You don't understand it.

212
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Someone like me

213
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,040
doesn't have the energy

214
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,300
to build a relationship with a stranger.

215
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,120
It's my instinct to be with you.

216
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,490
It's self-help.

217
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
If you don't take my hand,

218
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
I will sink.

219
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,160
♫There is a room♫

220
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,280
I don't get it.

221
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
♫who never step inside♫

222
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,800
♫Deeply buried in time♫

223
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,360
I don't get it,

224
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
♫So I♫

225
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
but whenever you reach out

226
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,480
♫lock the door♫

227
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,040
your hand to me,

228
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,400
I will take it.

229
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,640
♫and fake to be a new "I"♫

230
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,200
I don't have energy

231
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,800
♫Till you showed up♫

232
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,040
to build relationships

233
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,800
with strangers, either.

234
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,440
♫with your smile♫

235
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,720
Because I've used all my energy

236
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
on you and Ziqiu.

237
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,160
♫You are, you are♫

238
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,400

♫You are, you are♫

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,040
It's too hot.

♫Never let go♫

242
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,880
♫When I am down, you pick me off the ground♫

243
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,680
♫Now my heart is verified♫

244
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,760
♫You are...♫

245
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,340
Ling Xiao, the shampoo that I just bought...

246
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,660
What are you two doing?

247
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Playing.

248
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,560
Mingyue, come to eat!

249
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,640
Hurry up!

250
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,760
Coming!

251
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,320
Slowly.

252
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
Come, wipe your mouth.

253
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
What are you reading?

254
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
Girl comics.

255
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Yeah.

256
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,880
Girl comics.

257
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,960
Don't read it. It's a girl comic!

258
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
I found it in Li Jianjian's room

259
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,960
and it's not bad.

260
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,160
I stayed up all night to finish six volumes.

261
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,920
I didn't know

262
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,120
that you read this kind of books before.

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,060
What kind of books?

264
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,640
This is the book with a pink cover

265
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,360
that I saw in your studio the other day.

266
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,280
"Being Troubled by My Brother's Affection"!

267
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
Well, I don't understand it.

268
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,320
So did I

269
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,200
and Ling Xiao

270
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,360
make your troubled?

271
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,120
Stop reading it. Eat now!

272
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
Well, let me take a look at it.

273
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
What is all this?

274
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,570
What is all this?

275
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,420
Should you read a comic like this?

276
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,520
Why did you read this?

277
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,200
They're not blood-related,

278
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,960
just like the three of us!

279
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,360
No, I didn't mean that.

280
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,760
It's Du Juan's.

281
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,440
She likes reading

282
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,160
this kind of boring girl comics.

283
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
So what do you think about it?

284
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,560
I don't think it's good and I think

285
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,520
it's boring.

286
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,760
Since you find it boring,

287
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
why are you still reading it?

288
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,140
Don't read this kind of books.

289
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,330
I'll take this away.

290
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Now eat!

291
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,640
Why did you bring

292
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,040
that comic book out just now?

293
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,440
You just wanted

294
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,770
to embarrass me, right?

295
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
I really just wanted to read it

296
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
and I didn't think too much about it.

297
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,520
But

298
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,680
I think

299
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
you should tell them sooner,

300
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,490
or it'll affect their brotherhood

301
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,240
when they find it out one day.

302
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,960
I just don't want to affect their brotherhood.

303
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,360
But the longer you wait, the worse it'll be.

304
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,040
No, no, no.

305
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,940
I have to be cautious about it.

306
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,440
Onlookers see more

307
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,480
than players.

308
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,720
When will you show me

309
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,890
the seventh volume?

310
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,620
I haven't finished it yet.

311
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
It's in my studio.

312
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,000
Ms. Luo Hong,

313
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,800
our desserts

314
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,080
are freshly made every day,

315
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,200
and several kinds of

316
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
the coffee beans that we use

317
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,120
are at estate level.

318
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,520
Ziqiu, the ingredients you use

319
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,080
are really high in quality

320
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,300
and the hygiene is also very good.

321
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
I'm surprised

322
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
to see you run

323
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,900
such a high-quality coffee shop.

324
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,080
But the business is not good,

325
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,800
because maybe

326
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,320
the middle school students

327
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,680
can't afford it.

328
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,400
So

329
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
you've realized

330
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,680
the problem on your own.

331
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,980
According to my observation,

332
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
there are basically

333
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,680
some milk tea shop, stationery shop

334
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,140
and snack bar around here,

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,160
which are all low-cost stores.

336
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,960
It'll be summer vacation soon

337
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,560
and a lot of stores

338
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,960
are closed.

339
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,720
So you think I should close too?

340
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,320
I think you should

341
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
reduce the operating cost,

342
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,520
adjust the prices

343
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,760
and add

344
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
some low-cost drinks and desserts.

345
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,480
Even in summer vacation,

346
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,080
there're a lot of tutoring classes

347
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,600
near the school.

348
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
If you do some activities,

349
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,200
the students

350
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,660
will be attracted inside.

351
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,570
From the perspective of the operator,

352
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,080
even if you can afford it,

353
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,600
you shouldn't

354
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
let this shop keep going down.

355
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,600
You know,

356
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,420
you can't run a business with only the dream.

357
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,360
Would you like me to give a plan?

358
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,420
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

359
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
I think you're right,

360
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,720
but next,

361
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,180
I'll figure it out on my own

362
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,920
because I don't want to trouble you.

363
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,050
I won't be troubled.

364
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,010
I'm a good friend of your father's.

365
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't think you know my father.

366
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Here is the thing.

367
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,980
I have a quite good memory.

368
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,960
I remember you held me in your arms when I was little

369
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,890
and you bought me something to eat.

370
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,080
You do remember?

371
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,720
Yes.

372
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,920
So you must be clear

373
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,120
about my family.

374
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
I appreciate your kindness,

375
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
but I don't want to trouble you.

376
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,400
Ziqiu, your mother just wants to help you.

377
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

378
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,920
But no.

379
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,520
What are you doing? Why don't you work?

380
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
You startled me!

381
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,000
I haven't found

382
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,480
the material that I want.

383
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
Didn't I tell you

384
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,520
not to read it?

385
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
It's easy for girls to get immersed in it,

386
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,160
especially for someone like you

387
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,280
who's in similar situation.

388
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,080
There's such a strong psychological suggestion.

389
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,240
OK. OK.

390
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,040
I won't read it. I'll get to work.

391
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,080
But

392
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,120
I think you can

393
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,560
choose one of them to be your boyfriend.

394
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,880
If they have girlfriends,

395
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,410
they won't be so nice to you.

396
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
Really?

397
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Then you keep working overtime for Zhou Miao,

398
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
he must be really nice to you.

399
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
No.

400
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,840
He is not very considerate,

401
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,840
but I'm happy

402
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,920
and that's enough.

403
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,880
Since he is not considerate,

404
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,240
why are you still happy?

405
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,400
Because I'm in love with him.

406
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,200
When he's in front of me,

407
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,320
I feel happy

408
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,400
to look at him

409
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,100
even if he does nothing for me.

410
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,840
When you're

411
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
in love with someone,

412
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,720
you will find

413
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,680
that everything is so meaningful.

414
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,320
If this world is controlled

415
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,760
by someone like you,

416
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,000
this world will be a utopia.

417
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,360
What's wrong with someone like me?

418
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I'm happy!

419
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,640
Good!

420
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,680
Come back home for lunch with me.

421
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,000
You should have told me earlier

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,800
that you were coming back for lunch.

423
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,400
I didn't prepare something delicious for you.

424
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,460
Ziqiu asked me to come back for lunch.

425
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,290
Let's just eat this.

426
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,880
Did Ms. Luo Hong go to your shop?

427
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,600
Who is Ms. Luo Hong?

428
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,420
She's a friend of mine.

429
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,860
She runs a coffee shop.

430
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
She wanted to have a look at Ziqiu's shop

431
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,770
and give him some suggestions.

432
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,920
Dad, when did you

433
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
know her?

434
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,020
I've known her for a long time.

435
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,280
She's a friend of Ms. He Mei's, isn't she?

436
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Did she tell you that?

437
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,760
No, I remember her.

438
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
I remember that she was

439
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,600
a colleague of Ms. He Mei

440
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
at the cosmetic counter.

441
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,560
Why did you tell her

442
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,160
that my business isn't good?

443
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,920
She has nothing to do with us.

444
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,240
You remember things that happened so long ago?

445
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,760
Dad, we shouldn't

446
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,660
bother strangers with our problems.

447
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,520
OK.

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,680
But it was really your mother

449
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,000
who offered help.

450
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,840
She went to your shop

451
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,680
and she thought there was something wrong

452
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,720
with your operation.

453
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Don't contact her again.

454
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,560
She has started a new family

455
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,440
and it won't be good for her

456
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,040
if you keep in touch with her.

457
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,260
Yes, you're right.

458
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,360
I won't do it again.

459
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,320
Eat properly!

460
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
Look at how you're eating!

461
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm eating properly,

462
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
but you still

463
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,520
tell me off.

464
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,720
I know

465
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
in our family,

466
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,380
when Ziqiu tells you off, you tell me off, right?

467
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,480
I wasn't telling dad off.

468
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
I was reasoning things out with dad.

469
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,480
Well, are you two in love?

470
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,560
No!

471
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
We're just good brother and sister.

472
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,880
Really?

473
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,200
It's fine.

474
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,360
Dad, stop prying.

475
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
I'm not prying.

476
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,080
It's not like

477
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,760
that I want to know about it.

478
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,560
I just don't want to clean up the mess

479
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,160
when you break up.

480
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,720
Don't you know Ziqiu?

481
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,400
He just wants

482
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,560
to be on the same family register book

483
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,320
with us.

484
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,240
He was insane.

485
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,880
But I've cured him.

486
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,320
How?

487
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,060
I have the right medicine.

488
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,570
The love treatment.

489
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,760
It's greasy.

490
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,920
Dad, would you like some?

491
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,520
I have another

492
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,160
little heart.

493
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,280
No, I don't want it.

494
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,840
You want two?

495
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,560
Give them to him!

496
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,080
How about two?

497
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,410
I'll go and get the soup.

498
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,880
You naughty girl!

499
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,640
You're like a grasshopper.

500
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,920
What? Say it again!

501
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,760
It's nothing.

502
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,120
I'll give it a shot.

503
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,760
OK. OK.

504
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,840
Thank you, Mrs. Qian.

505
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
You're welcome!

506
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,960
Then I'm leaving now. Bye.

507
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,720
OK. Bye.

508
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,840
You're such a sweet-talker.

509
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,680
OK. Bye.

510
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,680
Let's go.

511
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,040
What did you say

512
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,880
to Mrs. Qian?

513
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,410
You were being mysterious.

514
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Is it really good to keep it from him?

515
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,840
Never mind.

516
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Let's go and take a taxi.

517
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,800
I need to withdraw some money first.

518
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,600
OK.

519
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,920
You acted like a lookout

520
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,720
while I was stealing money.

521
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,650
Why did you withdraw so much money?

522
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,120
To pay the employees.

523
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,240
You could transfer

524
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,840
the money.

525
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,920
Nobody still uses cash these days.

526
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
I'll transfer the money next month.

527
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,220
You withdraw money with credit card?

528
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Really?

529
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
I didn't pay attention to it.

530
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,720
Why did you withdraw money

531
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
with credit card?

532
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,330
Are you out of money?

533
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
I've got

534
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,440
some cash flow problem.

535
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,040
Ask Zhao Huaguang for money.

536
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:15,960
Why would I ask him

537
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,040
for money?

538
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,640
Didn't he give you the money?

539
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,720
No.

540
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,360
Wait. Wait! Wait a moment!

541
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,160
What did you mean?

542
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,120
Then who gave you the money to open the shop?

543
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
No one gave it to me. It was mine.

544
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,880
What do you mean by that?

545
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,200
Where did you get so much money?

546
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
I earned it myself!

547
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,800
Every penny

548
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,560
I spent on my shop

549
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,280
from the very beginning

550
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
was earned by me when I was abroad.

551
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,160
It has nothing to do

552
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,480
with Zhao Huaguang.

553
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,360
So have you got it?

554
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,520
What did you mean

555
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,560
by that Zhao Huaguang doesn't take care of Ziqiu anymore?

556
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
It means

557
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,200
after Zhao Huaguang took him abroad,

558
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,560
he took care of him for just two years.

559
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,800
The living expenses, the tuition fees

560
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,920
and the money he has spent on the shop

561
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,000
are all made by him doing the part-time jobs.

562
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,760
And we thought

563
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
he was having a good life

564
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,200
with that bastard!

565
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
No swearing!

566
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
Ziqiu, you say it.

567
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,680
It's nothing serious.

568
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,400
After getting abroad,

569
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
I didn't want to call him dad.

570
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,280
Zhao Huaguang asked me to change my last name to Zhao,

571
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,610
and I refused it firmly.

572
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,680
I didn't want to live with him,

573
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,640
because it was awkward,

574
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,680
so he got mad

575
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,400
and cut off his financial support for me.

576
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,880
But it was fine,

577
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,120
because I can feed myself.

578
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,640
It was no big deal.

579
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
It certainly wasn't.

580
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,160
Why didn't you tell Mr. Li about it?

581
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,400
Why should I have told him that?

582
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,920
It was something

583
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,400
between me and Zhao Huaguang.

584
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,680
He would have worried about me if he had known it.

585
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,040
Besides, how could you say that?

586
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
You didn't tell us everything.

587
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,440
What was

588
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,840
Zhao Huaguang thinking?

589
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,880
Didn't he worry about you

590
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,560
when you were working outside?

591
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,200
A lot of my classmates

592
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,060
did part-time jobs to earn money.

593
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,000
It's natural for adults

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,400
to support themselves.

595
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
But don't tell dad about this,

596
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,360
or he can't sleep at night

597
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,040
if he knows it.

598
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,040
You're using the credit card

599
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,440
to pay the employees now.

600
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,580
What to do next?

601
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,120
I've paid my rent

602
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
for three months now.

603
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,160
After I pay the employees this month,

604
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,880
there is no big expense this month.

605
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,640
And the cash flow is enough

606
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,440
for daily ingredients,

607
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,800
water and electricity expenses.

608
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,260
You should close the shop.

609
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,800
What?

610
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,560
Close it.

611
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,280
Why would I do that?

612
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,240
Well, it's in off-season

613
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,120
and I should adjust

614
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,360
my business strategy

615
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
and I'll see how it does in peak season.

616
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
If I close it now,

617
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,320
all my hard work

618
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,280
will be in vain!

619
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
You've met

620
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,800
the friend of dad

621
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,520
who runs a coffee shop today,

622
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,580
so what did she say?

623
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,410
She's not dad's friend,

624
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,490
but Ms. He Mei's friend.

625
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,600
It was her old colleague

626
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
at the cosmetic counter.

627
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,560
Why did she want to help you?

628
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,640
I find it odd too.

629
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,770
Dad must have begged her for it.

630
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,640
Or she wouldn't have

631
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,500
got involved in things like this.

632
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,160
So I can't close the shop.

633
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,260
I can't be a joke in their eyes.

634
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,600
Can you survive the off-season?

635
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,560
Kind of.

636
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
Ziqiu,

637
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,640
I'll make some royalty this month

638
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,800
and I can help you with it.

639
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,840
That's nonsense!

640
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,360
Keep your money.

641
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,000
What did you mean by that?

642
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,680
Didn't you say

643
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,200
that this shop is mine?

644
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,960
Does it still count?

645
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,680
No.

646
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,080
If there's no

647
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
proper mode of operation,

648
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
no one can fill this bottomless pit

649
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
and you should stop loss in time.

650
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,780
But this is the hard work of Ziqiu.

651
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,920
I don't want to give it up, either.

652
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,320
That's what those people who have lost their family fortunes

653
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,360
at the gambling tables think.

654
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,120
That's not the same.

655
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,160
Do something!

656
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
You've always been like this.

657
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,760
Every time we want to do something,

658
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,420
you'll throw cold water on us.

659
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,400
Oh.

660
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,600
You.

661
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,280
Don't misunderstand it.

662
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,440
I didn't mean that.

663
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
Ziqiu must have thought about

664
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,820
all the ways that I could have.

665
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,640
You could adjust it

666
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
and I don't want to throw cold water on you,

667
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,560
but a lot of ventures fail

668
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,280
and only a few can make it.

669
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,740
We should be calm about it.

670
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,000
Since it's your hard-earned money,

671
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,400
you shouldn't

672
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,480
lose it all in it.

673
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,440
I know.

674
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,960
I'll wait for the peak season.

675
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,400
I'll close it if it really doesn't work.

676
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,140
If you're in need of money,

677
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,530
I can give you a hand.

678
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,920
I don't have a lot,

679
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,640
but it's enough to help you

680
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,640
for a couple of months.

681
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,240
No need!

682
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,760
Keep your money

683
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,640
for yourself.

684
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,920
OK, I got it.

685
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,720
Then I'll leave you to it.

686
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,040
The one who always throws cold water is leaving now.

687
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,600
Seriously?

688
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
Is he mad?

689
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,410
Go and calm him down.

690
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,440
You go.

691
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,000
You go.

692
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,920
You go.

693
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,600
You go.

694
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,120
You go.

695
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,520
You go.

696
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:49,880
You go.

697
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,200
You go. Go!

698
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,840
Fine!

699
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,080
You're not mad?

700
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,360
A total of 27 seconds.

701
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,920
What 27 seconds?

702
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,080
When your boyfriend was mad,

703
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,920
it took you 27 seconds to get in here.

704
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,880
My boyfriend?

705
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,360
Yes, you're my boyfriend.

706
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,820
Yes, you're my boyfriend.

707
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,920
Don't tell Ziqiu

708
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,280
about us right now,

709
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,560
or it might be a burden for him.

710
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,080
Yes, I think so too.

711
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,200
Today I planned

712
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,560
to tell him about it,

713
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,440
but after I found out

714
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
about this suddenly,

715
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,120
I changed my mind,

716
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,960
because I don't want to upset him.

717
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,520
Yes.

718
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,840
I'm going out to buy some fruits.

719
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,410
I'll go with him.

720
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,760
Why are you going too?

721
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
Fruits these days are expensive.

722
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm going to pay for it.

723
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,320
Ziqiu!

724
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,840
Jianjian!

725
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,880
Wait for me!

726
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,130
You'll upset him by doing this.

727
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,680
Hello, it's 81.4 yuan in total.

728
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,080
Cash or WeChat pay?

729
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,040
Cash.

730
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,760
Ziqiu, I want to have some bananas.

731
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Bananas, right?

732
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,370
OK, I'll go and get some.

733
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,920
It's over there.

734
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,680
WeChat pay.

735
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,400
OK.

736
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,920
I'll scan it.

737
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,760
Here's the receipt.

738
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,680
The bananas are a little unripe.

739
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,120
We won't take them.

740
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,080
OK, please take the receipt.

741
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,280
Ziqiu!

742
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,720
Ziqiu, wait for me!

743
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,440
Ziqiu! Ziqiu!

744
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,720
I'm exhausted.

745
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
Are you mad?

746
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,200
So right now I need you

747
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,560
to pay for my fruits?

748
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,360
I'm not that poor.

749
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
I didn't say you are poor.

750
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,040
Everyone can be

751
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,240
short of money.

752
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
I should have paid

753
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,920
for whatever

754
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,240
you want to have.

755
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,900
I won't stop you from doing it,

756
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,480
but only when

757
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,240
you're out

758
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,100
of the trouble.

759
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,840
So what do you want to do now?

760
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,440
Do you plan to take care of me?

761
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,360
It won't be a problem for me.

762
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,760
I'll make a lot of money this month.

763
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,360
I'll be richer than both you and Xiao.

764
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,160
I want to take care of you,

765
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,720
not the other way around!

766
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,960
I know.

767
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,240
We are a family.

768
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,360
You can take care of me

769
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,400
and I can take care of you too.

770
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,760
How can I let you take care of me?

771
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Why not?

772
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,520
You can take care of me

773
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,050
but I can't take care of you?

774
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
Dad took care of me when I was little.

775
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,760
What do you want to do now?

776
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,240
Do you want

777
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
to take his place

778
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
to take care of me?

779
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,840
He Ziqiu,

780
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,280
that was a bit hurtful.

781
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,920
We are a family.

782
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,520
You can take care of me

783
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
and it's also reasonable if I want to take care of you.

784
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,560
There's nothing reasonable!

785
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,080
You shouldn't take care of me.

786
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,360
He Ziqiu, shut up!

787
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,650
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

788
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,810
You want to take care of Miss Li,

789
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,280
but it's impossible.

790
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,920
How long have you been standing there?

791
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
From the very beginning.

792
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Did anything happen to your family?

793
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,800
How could a rich second generation like you

794
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,320
be out of money?

795
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,760
It has nothing to do with you, so stay out of it.

796
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
He Ziqiu,

797
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,480
when others try to help you,

798
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,640
can you not be like a hedgehog

799
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,720
with sharp spikes?

800
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
That's what I wanted

801
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,720
to say to you.

802
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,160
Fine! I was being nosy!

803
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
Please tell Zhuang Bei

804
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,960
that I was forced by the situation

805
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,760
to give his mother the necklace.

806
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,520
Different from Li Jianjian,

807
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,040
I will never

808
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,240
spend my money

809
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,200
on men.

810
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,840
Then tell him yourself.

811
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,120
I won't see him again,

812
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,520
or he might think I'm still in love with him.

813
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,800
You're back.

814
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,080
What's wrong?

815
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,400
Don't call Ziqiu

816
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,600
a rich second generation again.

817
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,320
But Ziqiu is

818
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,160
a rich second generation.

819
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,120
No, he's not.

820
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,280
Zhao Huaguang stopped taking care of him long ago!

821
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,840
His living costs abroad

822
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,280
and the money he has spent on the shop

823
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,400
are all made by him

824
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,860
doing the part-time jobs.

825
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,960
Really?

826
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,920
I saw him withdraw money

827
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,480
with credit card today,

828
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,800
and he told me about it after I asked him closely.

829
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,060
Then how many part-time jobs has he done?

830
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,880
We used to think

831
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,000
that He Ziqiu lived better

832
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,240
than Ling Xiao,

833
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,520
because at least

834
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,760
he didn't have to suffer physically,

835
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,880
but now it seems

836
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,580
that he has lied about so many things.

837
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,560
You're back.

838
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
I'm back.

839
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,290
First of all, I didn't try to overhear.

840
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Ziqiu and you

841
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
were so loud

842
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,500
that everyone there would have heard it.

843
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,680
I was mean to He Ziqiu,

844
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,040
but it wasn't my fault.

845
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,480
I didn't know he was so pathetic.

846
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,200
If I had known it,

847
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,340
I would have been nicer to him.

848
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,480
He didn't tell us the truth

849
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,440
because he didn't want us

850
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,560
to be nice to him

851
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,920
for this reason.

852
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,680
Why?

853
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,880
He hates it when people pity him.

854
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,800
Want it?

855
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,000
You always use snacks to apologize.

856
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,670
Because it works!

857
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,440
And you won't be

858
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,710
really mad at me.

859
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,560
Besides, I'm heart-broken

860
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,480
and you're supposed

861
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,710
to be nice to me.

862
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,880
Have you really got over Zhuang Bei?

863
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,320
There're a lot of single men out there

864
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,600
and I'll have another one if this one doesn't work.

865
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,400
Besides,

866
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,790
judging from my appearance,

867
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,190
I'm good enough

868
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,150
for any men.

869
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
I was just

870
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,480
a little bit into him

871
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,409
and I was not that serious about it.

872
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,159
Have a look at me.

873
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,480
Don't you think I'm different today?

874
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,480
Smoky eyes.

875
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,800
Do you know that they stand for

876
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
in the costume drama?

877
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,800
They stand for being a heartless villain.

878
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,690
I'm going to take a bath.

879
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,040
If she wasn't that into him,

880
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,100
she wouldn't have given his mother that gold necklace.

881
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,800
Do you have money to burn?

882
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,720
Jianjian, should we have barbecue

883
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,600
or hotpot?

884
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,560
There is a hotpot restaurant

885
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,760
with great comments.

886
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,840
Both are fine.

887
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Let's have hotpot.

888
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
This restaurant has Wagyu slices.

889
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,280
Our studio

890
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,200
is going to be famous in the future

891
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,320
and we should be generous

892
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
to treat people to something nice.

893
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
You're right.

894
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,370
Then let's have hotpot.

895
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,400
Two brothers of Jianjian,

896
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,640
the lawyer friend,

897
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,280
Qi Mingyue and Tang Can.

898
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,320
Is there anyone else?

899
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,060
Are you really going to make it so big?

900
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,600
OK.

901
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,280
We're going

902
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
to have a small celebration.

903
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,680
Jianjian,

904
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,320
it's been a while

905
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,920
since you created anything.

906
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,360
Are you slacking off?

907
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,880
Yeah, Miss Li.

908
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
You should focus on work.

909
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,960
Eileen Chang once said

910
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,640
that not every hard work

911
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,680
would bring you some gain,

912
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,000
but if you want some gain,

913
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
you have to work hard.

914
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
Eileen Chang had never said anything this stupid.

915
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,160
I think it must have been a long time

916
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
since I carved Lord Guan

917
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,490
and he has stopped blessing me.

918
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,300
I'll go and get a piece of wood.

919
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,040
Why is Miss Li always talking

920
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,920
to me with sarcasm?

921
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,560
Aren't all artists like this?

922
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,320
Just get to work.

923
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,680
So we can get off work early today.

924
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,320
OK.

925
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,960
Everyone,

926
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,240
I want to say something

927
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,720
on behalf of our studio.

928
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,840
It has been

929
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,400
three years

930
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,840
since we opened this studio.

931
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,880
And this is

932
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,400
our first time

933
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,600
to sell a derivative copyright,

934
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,440
which is a huge step,

935
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
because this is the first step

936
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,200
of our studio

937
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,400
towards the international market.

938
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,280
And I believe

939
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,840
one day in the future,

940
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,160
Two Boys and A Girl

941
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,960
will be put on night tables of different households

942
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,920
in every corner of the world!

943
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,600
Let's applaud!

944
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,040
You don't look excited.

945
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,320
Come. Let's drink.

946
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,160
Let's drink.

947
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,520
Come. I'll drink with you.

948
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,380
Come. Tang Can.

949
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,800
Mingyue, I saw the help seeker

950
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,280
on your Moments last night.

951
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,040
If she wants to get a divorce,

952
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,360
I can provide some legal aid.

953
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
Really?

954
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,280
But I don't think she wants to divorce.

955
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
She just wants to threaten her husband

956
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,040
to change his mind.

957
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,880
It's fine.

958
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,240
Just come to me

959
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,040
if you need help.

960
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,920
Thank you.

961
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,920
Stop it. Save some for others.

962
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,320
It's fine. Eat more.

963
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,200
He Ziqiu,

964
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,040
stop taking it all away from me!

965
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,640
You should eat alone

966
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,760
with Li Jianjian.

967
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
Well, there's a lot in the pot.

968
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,660
You can have it.

969
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,280
This is for Ling Xiao.

970
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,440
Come. Have some tofu.

971
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,080
I want

972
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,600
a big brother like this.

973
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,380
If you had a big brother like this,

974
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,320
your boyfriend

975
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,640
would be jealous.

976
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,320
If I had a big brother like this,

977
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,920
I wouldn't need a boyfriend!

978
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,280
Didn't you tell your mother

979
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,160
not to place an order

980
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,240
at my Taobao shop?

981
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,840
My mom placed an order again?

982
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sorry.

983
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I'll tell her about it.

984
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,320
Tell her

985
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,240
to apply for a refund.

986
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,560
Tang Can,

987
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,400
I'm sorry.

988
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,340
Why did you apologize?

989
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,480
What have you done wrong?

990
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
I wasn't considerate

991
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,320
when I gave back the necklace to you

992
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,840
in public the other day.

993
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,880
No need.

994
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,740
I'll be straight with you.

995
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,080
You've done nothing wrong.

996
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,810
You are just not in love with me.

997
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,480
No worries.

998
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,560
I fell for you

999
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,220
because you look like my idol.

1000
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
I was insane

1001
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,960
to give your mother

1002
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,400
the gift that was meant

1003
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,600
for my mother.

1004
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,480
Don't get burdened for this.

1005
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,860
I have a lot of suitors.

1006
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,940
Can't you see that?

1007
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,120
Yes, I can.

1008
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,720
A pretty girl like you

1009
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
is supposed to have a lot of suitors.

1010
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,520
See? I know you would be here

1011
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,320
and I still came,

1012
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,920
which means

1013
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,200
I've moved on.

1014
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,660
We have a lot of friends in common,

1015
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,530
so there's no need to be embarrassed about it.

1016
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,530
I'm really relieved

1017
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,600
after hearing it.

1018
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,400
I'm relieved too.

1019
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,680
OK, go ahead to the bathroom.

1020
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,740
I'm going back now.

1021
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,820
One last question for you.

1022
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,440
Yes?

1023
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,320
What do you

1024
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
not like about me?

1025
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,400
There's nothing wrong with you.

1026
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,280
I mean it.

1027
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,740
But I'm in love with someone else.

1028
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,000
I see.

1029
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,320
So what's

1030
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
she like?

1031
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,480
She's quiet,

1032
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,080
clever

1033
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,120
and graceful

1034
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,560
with a nine-to-five job.

1035
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,360
Let's hang out together next time.

1036
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,490
Well, I haven't confessed my love yet.

1037
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,040
Then you should hurry up,

1038
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,000
or someone else

1039
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,130
might take her away.

1040
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,000
OK, I will.

1041
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Good luck! I wish you happiness!
