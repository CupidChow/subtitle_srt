26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,560
Are you saying that I should bad-mouth her?

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,000
It's not that. This is not what we meant.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
We merely feel that it's extremely unfair

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,530
for the evil people to be so full of themselves.

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,890
For this, it should be discussed at length.

31
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,410
Wait as I think while eating.

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,850
Erxi!

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,430
Weiwei!

34
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,840
What a coincidence! What are you doing at this restaurant?

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,230
Yes, I heard the chicken wings here were very good.

36
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,420
Why are you here?

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,510
Let me introduce them.

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,110
This is our school beauty queen, Meng Yiran. You probably know that already.

39
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,770
This is her roommate, Nana. We are all interning at Zhi Yi Technology

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,950
and we're really close. They're treating me to a meal!

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,220
Erxi eats so much, and you guys are treating her?

42
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,940
You're so nice!

43
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,770
Aren't you going through a breakup?

44
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,770
I am!

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,890
My little Becky (Beckham), why did you marry

46
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,380
Victoria that demon girl?

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,860
And even had so many children with her, my heart is so broken!

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,630
Breakups are so painful.

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,090
Poor child, it's been years

50
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,190
and she still hasn't gotten over it.

51
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,590
You guys...

52
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,360
Let me tell you. Weiwei is my best friend.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,530
Weiwei, have some, too!

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,070
I'll pass. I won't eat with you guys today.

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,390
After all, not everyone

56
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,230
is interested in another person's food.

57
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,770
Something's come up. I have to leave first.

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,810
Yiran!

59
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,170
Waitress, they are picking up the tab!

60
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,350
Yiran! Yiran, let me explain. I didn't know they were best friends.

61
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,510
Don't follow me!

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,920
Yiran! Listen to me, Yiran!

63
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,070
- Yiran, I didn't know they were friends!
- Drive!

64
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,440
Stop eating, I'll take you somewhere better.

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
There's so much good food.

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,770
Can't you show more spine?

67
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,910
I just said we don't eat someone else's food. Let's go!

68
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,240
- W-Wait!
- Let's go.

69
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,950
Hurry!

70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,200
Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered so much,

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,440
even though it felt good to trick them.

72
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,200
However, we wasted so much good food!

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,800
It's such a pity!

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,910
Not at all!

75
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,810
What if we get some take-out?

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,570
Ah Shuang?

77
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,270
What's wrong?

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,210
I just saw someone I know.

79
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,590
Shouldn't he be working overtime in the office?

80
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,560
Why is he here?

81
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Driver, can we go back and pick up the girl who was with me?

82
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,080
<i>Why didn't you get on together?</i>

83
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,640
Driver, please stop.

84
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,720
<i>Do you think you are above others because your family is rich?</i>

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,320
<i>Everyone has to revolve around you.</i>

86
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,300
<i>It serves you right that Xiao Nai has no interest in you!</i>

87
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,490
<i>It would be truly unfair if you have everything you want.</i>

88
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,200
It would be best if nobody likes you for the rest of your life. That's what I call thrilling.

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,790
So what if you're pretty? You're still so stupid.

90
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,230
I managed to order you around as I pleased.

91
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,210
<i>Miss, are you still picking up someone?</i>

92
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,010
Just drive!

93
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,760
How is it?

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,440
It's the same as this morning.

95
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,750
It's still at 1.1 gigabytes.

96
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,380
- <i>Here are the documents you wanted.
- Thank you.
- Anything else you need help with?</i>

97
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,390
<i> Nothing else.</i>

98
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,900
<i>Okay.</i>

99
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,790
Come to get lunch! Thank you.

100
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,890
This is the boxed lunch for today. Oh right, here is the bill for last week.

101
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,940
Take a look.

102
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,870
What's up with your company?

103
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,220
Don't you even have a proper front desk?

104
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,650
Every time I come here, he's always there with weird poses.

105
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,490
If I weren't brave, I would be afraid to deliver here.

106
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,140
Is this company legal?

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,160
Our company is a serious gaming company. We are definitely legitimate.

108
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,190
Then... what about him?

109
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,910
Sir, you probably don't know.

110
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,840
Inspiration gathers here.

111
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,510
It's especially easy to get ideas here.

112
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,110
When our programmers get stuck,

113
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,120
they come here.

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,050
That's a high tech fantasy.

115
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,410
But looking at his hair, it seems that it hasn't been washed for days.

116
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,410
Is this hairstyle also for inspiration?

117
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,420
Look. Those hairs sticking up

118
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,060
make it even easier to capture inspiration.

119
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,280
It works pretty much like an antenna.

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,770
That sounds quite reasonable.

121
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,500
The bill looks fine. I'll pay you right now.

122
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,020
Okay.

123
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,280
<i>Brothers gather around. Time to eat.</i>

124
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,820
<i>Okay, coming.</i>

125
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,450
Is it still the same with daily delivery this week?

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,390
Deliver until noon on the 31st.

127
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,970
If we want to extend the order delivery later, I will call you.

128
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,400
Okay.

129
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,040
Senior Qiu, are they stuck on something?

130
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,150
Why aren't they coming out to eat?

131
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,500
That's right. They did a test this morning.

132
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,200
The optimization results were as expected.

133
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,670
Say, Junior Sister Weiwei, time is so tight right now.

134
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,800
Isn't it to be expected that there is some difference with the product?

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,350
Right? Third Brother is too much of a perfectionist.

136
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,540
Now, we have run into this K.O.

137
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,940
He is also a perfectionist.

138
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,580
Unless they reach their goal, they won't stop.

139
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,980
With the two of them together, I can't take it anymore.

140
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,640
Let's just eat!

141
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,400
Third Brother has been in the office for two days now with no sleep.

142
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,250
Yesterday when I left, they still hadn't slept.

143
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,390
When I came in this morning, they were already working.

144
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,900
Although at noon, Master took a 30-minute nap.

145
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,960
Will their bodies handle it at this rate?

146
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
What is there to worry about?

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,340
I finally realized now. The difference between me and them is not intelligence,

148
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,070
but in perseverance and stamina. Look at these two psychos.

149
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,850
With only three hours of sleep each day, they still have so much energy.

150
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,610
They aren't even human.

151
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,720
But today is already the 30th. We must fly to Shanghai tomorrow night.

152
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,640
They are still stuck. Will they make it in time?

153
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,380
Ignore those two.

154
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,770
I took a look. These optimization results

155
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,220
may not have reached expectations, but are already really good.

156
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,590
So the two of them are masochistic.

157
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,220
We can't do anything if they like to torture themselves. Right?

158
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,420
Even if we just bring this version,

159
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,470
we will definitely not lose.

160
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,750
Should we call them out to eat?

161
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,430
It's okay, Junior Sister Weiwei. Just leave the food here.

162
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,900
They will come out to find food when they are hungry.

163
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,200
You decided to come out!

164
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,480
Let me heat it up for you. It's cold now.

165
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,320
It's fine. I'm almost done.

166
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,990
Let's go. Let me show you a place.

167
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,190
- Where?
- Flower market.

168
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,710
It's so far away. Why are we going there?

169
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,720
You'll find out once we get there.

170
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,200
Where are you going?

171
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,360
Why are there so few people here?

172
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,460
It would be strange if there were a lot of people.

173
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,710
It's the Qixi Festival today.
<i>(Qixi is July 7th on the Chinese lunar calendar, considered to the be the Chinese Valentine's Day)</i>

174
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,220
Qixi?

175
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,110
In the past, on Qixi,

176
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,290
it was very lively whenever I went past here.

177
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,720
I haven't gone shopping with you for the entire summer, so I want to take a stroll with you now.

178
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,080
However, doing this with me now...

179
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,380
isn't it too insincere?

180
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,700
But Weiwei, you didn't do this for me either

181
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,790
and completely forgot about Qixi.

182
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,750
You don't have a single shred of sincerity.

183
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,790
I've wronged you.

184
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,890
I'm asking my dear boyfriend,

185
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,970
as the magnanimous adult, please forgive me. Okay?

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,020
I'll forgive you with reluctance. You shouldn't do this again.

187
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,920
Why are you not talking?

188
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,040
To give your brain a rest.

189
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,800
You only slept a little last night, right?

190
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,700
And now, you're taking me out, too.

191
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,710
Wouldn't it better for you to go home and take a nap?

192
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,130
I don't feel tired.

193
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,400
What you mean is... I can order you around to my heart's content?

194
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,680
It seems I've never been ordered around by you yet.

195
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,470
You can try.

196
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,840
It sounds like a threat.

197
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,510
It's an invitation.

198
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,290
Fine. Since you're so busy these days,

199
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,780
I won't give you any missions.

200
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,280
Couple missions?

201
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,420
Did you and Senior Brother K.O. run into any problems?

202
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,310
With what we expected to achieve,

203
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,810
there's still a gap.

204
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,210
Houzi Jiu already said it. You guys have done a good job already.

205
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,590
You are just too much of a perfectionist.

206
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,360
It's not that I want you to give up,

207
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,350
I just think that you don't have to force yourself.

208
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,840
Perhaps if you take a break, you can even get new ideas

209
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,330
for better results, right?

210
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,780
Let's go.

211
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,850
I think that in the game now,

212
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,790
it's more boisterous than in reality.

213
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,720
Everyone is probably setting off fireworks or something.

214
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:07,030
<i> [New product in the market]</i>

215
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,180
What is it?

216
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,160
I got it.

217
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,000
Got what?

218
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,690

253
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,080
<i>This time, they'll definitely succeed.</i>

254
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,590
<i>This time, they've packaged it well.</i>

255
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,810
Hey.

256
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,180
Why does everyone look so nervous right now?

257
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,200
This morning, Brother Xiao said that he could finish it.

258
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,260
Right now, they're running the scenarios,

259
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,990
but we don't know if they can achieve the result.

260
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,800
<i>Last night, what time did he stay up until?</i>

261
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,720
In the typical scenario, the memory usage is around 750.

262
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,710
- It's a little lower than we expected.
- Simulate the River God flood scenario.

263
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,750
It's so smooth that I'm going to cry. The display didn't experience any degradation.

264
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,900
The peak value is 880.

265
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,320
The average value is kept around 820.

266
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,520
Yes! It's steady, not exceeding 1GB.

267
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,420
Third Brother, we've succeeded.

268
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,910
Our memory usage has gone down by nearly half.

269
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,920
Yay!! We succeeded! We completed it!

270
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,900
We don't need work overtime anymore. I want to sleep. I want to sleep a hundred hours!!

271
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,350
- They've succeeded?
- They've succeeded?
- Really?

272
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,890
- So they've succeeded?
- They must have. Brother Mei is even hugging everyone he sees.

273
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,500
Thank for your hard work.

274
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,020
Third Brother, thank you for your hard work.

275
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,080
Third Brother, K.O., this time I have to admit that

276
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,950
you two are indeed better than me a tiny, tiny bit.

277
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,910
A tiny, tiny bit!

278
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,320
They're coming out!

279
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,570
<i>Excellent!</i>

280
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,300
How is it, Brother Xiao? Have we succeeded?

281
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,920
Everyone, although time is very tight,

282
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,200
we were able to finish our goal in time.

283
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,590
Yes! That's great! We've really succeeded.

284
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,610
I didn't think we would really succeed. Was there no degradation with the graphics?

285
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,700
Don't worry. It was definitely perfect.

286
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,150
Ask for a bonus.

287
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,410
<i>- Ask for a bonus!
- Ask for a bonus!</i>

288
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,520
- <i>Ask for a bonus!</i>
- I'm going to go in for now.

289
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,860
According to our previous plan, this time I myself, Banshan,

290
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,640
Houzi, Hao Mei, Ah Shuang and K.O.

291
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,510
will attend the demo together in Shanghai.

292
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,850
From now on, everyone else gets two weeks off.

293
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,160
Two weeks? Really?

294
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,270
Of course.

295
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,610
Thank you for your hard work during this period, everyone, so have a good rest back home.

296
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,260
About the presentation tomorrow, if you have any suggestions or ideas,

297
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,370
you may bring them up now.

298
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,310
I have a suggestion. As someone in art design,

299
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,660
I don't have any thoughts about other areas,

300
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,100
but for this trip, you gentlemen are representing Zhi Yi Technology.

301
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,320
Can we take a bit of care about our appearances?

302
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,980
Of course, Brother Xiao, you don't need to.

303
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,600
Good looks can make up for everything.

304
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,530
About the rest of you, I think you guys could take the time to buy some clothes,

305
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,160
or change your hairstyle or something.

306
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,220
Especially for Yugong, you look so untidy.

307
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,450
Don't I look tidy?

308
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,770
It's not that. I just can't specifically tell where the problem is.

309
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,640
This is a good suggestion. I think we should adopt it.

310
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,590
- Is there any other question?
- No.

311
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,800
If there are none, we are dismissed.

312
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,740
Oh yeah!

313
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,220
I'm not going to Shanghai. I don't like these kinds of events under the spotlight.

314
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,670
Moreover, I don't like to dress up.

315
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,820
It's fine if you don't attend the meeting. You don't like to talk, anyway.

316
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,680
But you should let us see how you look in formal attire.

317
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Boss.

318
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,260
I have the attire, but I won't be joining you guys.

319
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,080
I'm not feeling that well... I'm going to go home to rest for now.

320
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,880
Okay, then I'll see you at the airport.

321
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,660
Why do I feel like... he's acting a bit weird?

322
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,980
One look and I can tell that he has gone mad from working overtime.

323
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,050
I think that my arms and legs are a bit weird.

324
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,490
Let's have a meeting to discuss the details of the demo later–

325
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,120
Let's discuss the details tomorrow morning then.

326
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,530
Be alert. We are going to improve your image first.

327
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,130
Weiwei,

328
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,820
let's go together.

329
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,410
- Gorgeous...
- Show me the best looking suit here.

330
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,570
Wait. No, give it to me! To me!

331
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,680
Do you want to change the store?

332
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,150
Please help this man find the best-fitted suit as well.

333
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,890
<i>Okay.</i>

334
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,550
Don't you need to get one?

335
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,950
I have some already, so there's no need for now.

336
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,470
I advise you guys not to wear the same style as mine.

337
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,420
That will only expose your shortcomings.

338
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,230
Are you worried that my powerful body would make you look effeminate?

339
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,330
You guys, stop arguing.

340
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,120
This suit is most suitable for

341
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,280
those mature and dependable men like me.

342
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,430
- Why don't you two change into something else?
- Ha ha.

343
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,710
Third Sister-in-law, you'll be the judge.

344
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,860
Who's the most handsome?

345
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,700
Why do you guys have to wear the same style?

346
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,850
Of course, we have to wear the same style.

347
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,420
Only like this, can we find out who's the most good-looking one.

348
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,270
You're all pretty handsome.

349
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,550
But... I recommend that you guys not wear the same style.

350
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,330
People will think that you got it on wholesale.

351
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,670
How can we all look handsome? You can tell no matter what that...

352
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,400
one, two, three... (<i>rankings</i>)

353
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,950
Third Sister-in-Law, couldn't you pay attention to

354
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,220
- this thing called class?
- Haha.

355
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,290
A person must be honest.

356
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,580
Is telling the truth very hard?

357
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,900
Telling the truth? Then let me organize my thoughts.

358
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,880
Senior K.O. is so handsome.

359
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,040
Why are you looking at me?

360
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,600
It's not very comfortable.

361
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,580
You need to adjust your collar.

362
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,860
Seriously. Why are you so handsome even when you're not wearing it properly.

363
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,930
You can't even button the second button of this suit. Don't you know that?

364
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,970
Hey, I don't really understand.

365
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,080
It's fine if you don't understand. In any case, you're... good-looking.

366
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,220
Fine. I'm going to find something more lively,

367
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,150
something that fits me.

368
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,540
Okay, then I'm going to select another...

369
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,950
that's more mature.

370
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,650
Then you'll... help me find one?

371
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,770
I didn't think that K.O. would be so handsome in a suit.

372
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,970
Why are you staring at me?

373
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,560
I'm comparing to when you first saw me.

374
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,860
I want this. Find one of my size. Thank you.

375
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,480
Okay.

376
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,210
Are you buying one, too?

377
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,110
Just trying one on.

378
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,560
Erxi, take a cab and come here now

379
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,730
to look at good looking guys trying on suits.

380
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,780
You will regret if you don't come.

381
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,520
Is this for real? Where are the good looking guys from?

382
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,800
Master's company.

383
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,250
Senior Brothers? Can I resist the temptation?

384
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,730
I'm coming right now.

385
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,150
Why are you so nice and notifying me in advance when there is good stuff?

386
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,920
I find it too embarrassing to be in a daze.

387
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,140
Hence, I'm calling you here to express via your reaction.

388
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,180
Come and express my inner-self.

389
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,330
<i>Hey, Weiwei, what's the address?</i>

390
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,360
- You don't need to come anymore.
- <i>Huh?</i>

391
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,460
<i>Why? I was just leaving.</i>

392
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,850
Because I don't want to share anymore.

393
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,670
Rotten Weiwei! You are not loyal.

394
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,710
I already said you won't win. Xiao Nai completed the optimization sooner.

395
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,150
<i>It seems that he is a strong competitor.</i>

396
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,610
<i>Thankfully, I'm fully prepared.</i>

397
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,530
<i>You don't need to bother about anything else. Just take care of yourself.</i>

398
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,100
<i>The best show comes at the end.</i>

399
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,640
Thank you for coming. Please be careful.

400
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,180
- I'll take Weiwei home.
- Okay.

401
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,520
See you at the airport tonight. Bye-bye.

402
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,370
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Let's go.

403
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,510
Let's go to your apartment now.

404
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,550
I'll pack up and leave for the airport.

405
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,180
Okay, then. I'm leaving tomorrow, too.

406
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,350
Moving back to your roommate's place?

407
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,610
Were you so busy that you forgot what day tomorrow is?

408
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,490
School starts tomorrow, of course, I'm moving back to the dorm.

409
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,640
Let's go.

410
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,530
<i> [Monday. August 31, 2015]</i>

411
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,920
It seems I can't go with you for registration tomorrow.

412
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,480
It will be terrible if you go with me.

413
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,250
If it doesn't go well, you will be surrounded.

414
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,570
Who is it?

415
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,360
Dad.

416
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,980
Where's my Xu Bei Hong?

417
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,080
Where did you put my Xu Bei Hong and Wu Guang Zhong?!

418
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,420
Why are you running? Your art pieces won't run away.

419
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,620
Why are you guys just standing there?

420
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,370
Weiwei, get some tea.

421
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,560
All the paintings are here.

422
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,790
I was worried to death.

423
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,280
- Careful, careful.
- These are the manuscripts.

424
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,270
Put them aside first.

425
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,630
Look at what's going on now and you still think about your paintings?

426
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,580
Is this more important than your future daughter-in-law?

427
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,600
Xiao Nai, it's not that your parents are not open-minded,

428
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,180
- it's just about your little girlfriend. Isn't she—
- You guys got it wrong.

429
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,210
The place she borrowed had a small issue so she stayed here for a few days.

430
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,340
What about you?

431
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,760
For the past few days, I've constantly slept at the office. I just returned.

432
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,740
Tonight, I'm going to fly to Shanghai and

433
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,140
participate in the demo presentation conference of Feng Teng Technologies.

434
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,840
Weiwei is also moving back to the dorm. That's why she is packing.

435
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,460
- It's not that we, as parents, aren't open-minded. It's just–
- Hey, hey.

436
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,450
So, do you support him or not?

437
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,380
Just deal with your paintings. Don't interrupt.

438
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,440
Look. One moment, you want me to get involved; and the next, you don't want me to interfere.

439
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,850
Do you even have any standard?

440
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,840
You guys first settle your opinions. I'll go to the kitchen first to have a look.

441
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,210
You!

442
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,540
What should we do?

443
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,960
Could Professor Xiao and Professor Lin believe that

444
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,720
I'm one of those especially loose girls?

445
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,920
Typically, they would only think that I am the loose one.

446
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,850
However, just in case, you can act like the victim.

447
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,440
I've thought about it!

448
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,170
However, I ate boxed meals with you guys every day and grew a lot fatter.

449
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,980
With this face full of grease, how could I look like a victim?

450
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,110
You mean... could it be, if you didn't get fat,

451
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,940
you really would pretend to be the victim?

452
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,740
That's a must! To a mo—
<i>(Note: she was about to say "mother-in-law")</i>

453
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,410
Making a good first impression is so important.

454
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,960
Don't worry. It's already been clearly explained.

455
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,140
Quickly, serve tea to your mother-in-law.

456
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,610
Hurry.

457
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,290
I know!

458
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,660
Professor Lin. Professor Xiao. Please have some tea.

459
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,950
Have a seat.

460
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,810
Sit.

461
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,550
Your thesis was well-written.

462
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,990
Thank you, Professor.

463
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,570
Because of a small problem at the place I borrowed from my roommate,

464
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,730
so I temporarily stayed here for a few days.

465
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,430
Xiao Nai already told us. Don't worry.

466
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,820
The dean of your department lives right next door to us and already said good things about you.

467
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,630
We know that you are a good girl.

468
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,500
It's not that we, as parents, aren't open-minded. If...

469
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,220
It's time for me to go to the airport.

470
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,540
Mom, Weiwei is going to school. I don't have time to take her there.

471
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,510
When you guys go back, take her with you on the way.

472
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,360
Sure, sure.

473
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,850
No, no, no, don't.

474
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,580
I don't need to trouble you, really.

475
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,790
That's fine.

476
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,970
Uncle, Aunt, we've arrived at my dorm. You don't have to see me further.

477
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,010
No problem. We'll just see you to the doorstep. It's up ahead. We're almost there.

478
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,320
Isn't that the Professor Xiao of the Archaeology Department?

479
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,750
That's right. And the other person is our department's, Professor Lin.

480
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,650
Huh? Has Bei Weiwei even met Xiao Nai's parents?

481
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,060
<i>- Gosh, they're even escorting her to school.</i>
- We're here.

482
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,050
<i>I've seen lots of people showing off their love, but there are even those who show off their in-laws.</i>

483
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,790
<i>It's seriously original to the point of illness.</i>

484
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,310
- It's here, right?
- Yes, yes.

485
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,830
Eh, the suitcase is heavy.

486
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,920
- No problem.
- It's fine now, Uncle. It is fine to see me here.

487
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,510
I'll ask friends in my dorm to help me carry the luggage.

488
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,670
- Can they carry it? There's so much stuff.
- They can.

489
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,710
Don't be polite. Once Xiao Nai gets back, come to our house often to eat meals.

490
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,330
- That's right.
- Okay.

491
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,960
- You can give me the stuff, okay? Then, Uncle, Aunt, how about I see you off?
- Eh? No need.

492
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,310
- No need.
- No need.

493
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,880
No need to be so formal. We'll go by ourselves.

494
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,940
Quickly, go upstairs.

495
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,980
- Okay, then.
- Be careful.

496
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,220
Goodbye.

497
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,310
Uncle, Aunt, goodbye.

498
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,380
We heard the news from upstairs!

499
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,070
Was it really Master's mom and dad who escorted you to school?

500
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,580
Weiwei, you're too amazing, aren't you?

501
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,220
At most, others have parents send them off to school, but you actually have your in-laws sending you off.

502
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,580
- Carry stuff!
- Hey, we want to hear the details.

503
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,560
Remember to explain in detail!

504
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,990
Hello? Have you arrived?

505
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,030
It was pretty quick today. It didn't finish late.

506
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,540
Shanghai also has a traffic jam?

507
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,380
Okay. Then I won't bother you.

508
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,400
Rest early.

509
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,430
Bye-bye.

510
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,190
"Rest early. Okay, bye-bye."

511
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,800
Wow, you're so sweet.

512
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,700
You and Da Zhong have already been sweet for two years. Won't you allow me to fight back a little?

513
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,820
Hey, enough with you guys. In this case, the people who lose out the most are me and Erxi.

514
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,840
Didn't you just brush your teeth? Are you forgetful?

515
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,970
- Wh-What did she say?
- She said that after she brushed her teeth, she secretly ate again.

516
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,150
Wh-What?

517
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,430
The dessert gift bag you brought back.

518
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,980
Amazing!

519
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,910
It was such a tiring day. Finally, I can reward myself.

520
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,870
That's right! When did you guys make up?

521
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,190
Before, why were you fighting?

522
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,270
Why we were fighting isn't important.

523
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:33,820
The important thing... isn't it the case someone went to live somewhere after the fight?

524
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,050
- That's right!
- That's right!

525
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,480
Weiwei, what's the situation? What's the situation?

526
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,650
- Quickly, speak! What's the situation?
- There is no situation!

527
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,430
- It's nothing!
- Quickly, speak! What's the situation?

528
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,340
<i>There's no situation!</i>

529
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,210
<i>No matter what you tell me to say, there isn't anything!</i>

530
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,420
Xiao Ling, you really are something. Even while standing in line, you don't forget to shop for fun.

531
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,710
What do you understand? This is called high efficiency.

532
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,300
Today, there's also a big sale. It's even more worth it than usual.

533
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,060
I've waited for this day for a long time.

534
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,830
Hey, look at this brand. 70% off.

535
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,310
Let me have a look. Wow, it's real. Then I have to quickly snatch it.

536
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,650
Exactly! New semester, new appearance, right?

537
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:26,160
Let everyone look at our gorgeous transformation, and dazzle their eyes.

538
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,270
It's our turn. Snatch it later, okay?

539
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,060
Wait a moment.

540
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,500
Okay. I just finished buying it.

541
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,000
The shopping cart only saves it for 20 minutes.

542
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,970
If you don't complete the payment, the food in your mouth will be snatched away.

543
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,020
Rich people really pay fast.

544
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,000
We're already in our junior year so fast. I still remember our military training.
<i>(Note: Military training is mandatory before university studies)</i>

545
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,680
Are you talking about when you pretended to have a stomachache and were scolded by the military instructor?

546
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,980
Enough, enough with you two. What are you doing later?

547
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,790
I'm going to Zhen Yi Technology to get my internship pay. Who's coming with me?

548
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,270
- I've got plans with our Da Zhong.
- Uh,

549
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,990
- I'm at that time of the month.
- There's no love for your classmate!

550
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,140
Even if I had any, I wouldn't give any to you.

551
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,940
- I'll be going first.
- Bye-bye!

552
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,200
Bye-bye.

553
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,520
- Weiwei.
- Okay. In any case, I don't have anything to do.

554
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,240
Yeah!

555
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,370
- Let's go!
- Wait for me for a second. I need to answer a call of nature.

556
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,740
Very fast.

557
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,400
Quickly.

558
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,830
