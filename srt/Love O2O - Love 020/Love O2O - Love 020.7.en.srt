You are too amazing. You killed them without spilling a drop of blood.

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,910
I am not worthy of your praise. Let's go.

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,900
Let's tackle the last quest for the "Legend of the Condor Heroes."

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,660
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,870
Did you say that you got to the last quest level in Condor Heroes?

31
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,540
That's right.

32
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,360
Are you talking about the one that's really, really insane?

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,430
The one no couples could complete on this server since the beginning of its operation?

34
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,800
- It seems to be.
- Wow.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,910
Such an insane quest can probably only be completed by someone insane like Naihe.

36
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,410
You guys definitely can't complete it.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,540
Of course, we can't! We're not insane.

38
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,590
It has nothing to do with whether you're insane. First of all,

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,950
- you would need a female companion.
- This...

40
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,940
- Let's go.
- Sure.

41
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,870
Yixiao Naihe and Luwei Weiwei,

42
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,200
what a couple made in heaven! Your love and courage

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,770
allowed you to overcome the challenges one after another so that you could come here.

44
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,400
First, I want to bid you congratulations.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,570
Next, you will face the last challenge in the "Legend of the Condor Heroes":

46
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,560
The Lovelorn Maneuver. The most difficult one of all ultimate challenges.

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you have confidence in becoming the first couple

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,510

<i>If he can't find you within that time, you will fail the mission.</i>

53
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,410
<i>16 hours? How difficult is this mission?</i>

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,320
<i>Also, they wouldn't prevent us from logging off. Right?</i>

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,010
<i>I'll check the forum for info.</i>

56
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,390
<i>I just fell from a high place. Can I be at the bottom of a cliff?</i>

57
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,360
<i>For Master to find me, does this mean he'll have to jump off a cliff?</i>

58
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,970
<i>Of course, this place</i>

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,030
<i>doesn't even appear on the map.</i>

60
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,700
<i>Weiwei.</i>

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,690
<i>Master! We can still chat?</i>

62
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,380
<i>Yeah. Just now, I received the mission. I have to find you within 16 hours.</i>

63
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,760
<i>Tell me about the surroundings around you now.</i>

64
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,330
I...

65
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,920
The surroundings around me

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
are very dark, very dark, very dark...

67
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>Can't you see anything at all?</i>

68
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,380
<i>Nothing!</i>

69
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,810
<i>What about sounds?</i>

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,330
There seem to be sounds of running water.

71
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,550
<i>Okay, I understand.</i>

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,620
I can't just wait and do nothing.

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
Since we can still chat,

74
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,590
why don't I find more information to tell Master?

75
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,310
<i>Could she be somewhere nearby?</i>

76
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,610
<i>Master!</i>

77
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,380
<i>What is it?</i>

78
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,470
<i>This is too unusual. I just went to the official website to look up this mission.</i>

79
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,070
<i>Never mind that there are no strategy tips for players,</i>

80
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,620
<i>but there's only a single sentence on the official website to describe this challenge.</i>

81
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,280
<i>What is it?</i>

82
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,820
<i>You can only complete this challenge through a couple's telepathy.</i>

83
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,970
<i>What kind of nonsense is this?</i>

84
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,500
<i>It's so dark that I wonder if it's just a black monitor screen.</i>

85
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,050
<i>I might as well get some work done on my exam paper.</i>

86
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,950
The delightful dice is adorned with red beans.

87
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,060
Is it aware of the longing since the ancient times?

88
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,930
I have already been waiting here for 30 years.

89
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,050
You are the first person to arrive at this precipice.

90
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,280
Thirty years ago, my junior fellow apprentice suddenly disappeared.

91
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,000
I followed his trail to this point

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,460
but my path has been obstructed by the state of play in this Go game.

93
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,230
The clues should be found on this chessboard,

94
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,570
but I am not an expert at the strategy of playing Go.

95
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,590
Young hero, could you help me solve this?

96
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,350
So this is how it is supposed to be.

97
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,550
Young hero,

98
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,120
in case you cross this natural moat and run into my junior,

99
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,420
please give him this jade pendant.

100
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,190
Even after you cross this natural moat, there is still a Lovelorn Maneuver formation.

101
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,820
I heard it's tremendously difficult.

102
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,300
Young hero, you must exercise extreme care.

103
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,850
I have here a secret manuscript to help you pass the challenge.

104
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,210
Please have a look, young hero.

105
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,050
Young hero, this way please.

106

<i>All the love you find</i>

107

<i>Love breeds anxiety, and love engenders fear.</i>

109

<i>Avoid love, and thus be without anxiety and fear.</i>

110

111
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,900

112
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,450
<i>However, to rescue your beloved partner,</i>

113
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,220
<i>you must get past this stage of mine.</i>

114
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,600
<i>Are you truly willing, to rescue your beloved partner,</i>

115
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>to sacrifice everything?</i>

While I haven't attacked yet, it's not too late to turn back.

118
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,760
What's that on your waist?

119
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,560
It turns out he already came to look for me.

120
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,750
Senior, I misunderstood you.

121
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,960
<i>Young hero, your partner is just at the bottom of the valley.</i>

122
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,320
<i>Let the Paired Lovebirds take you there.</i>

<i>May those in love be united as a couple at the end.</i>

<i>Master's way of appearing is way too brilliant, isn't it?</i>

130
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,990
<i>Like an angel descending, except he's just missing a pair of wings.</i>

<i>A Ghost Story is releasing a two-person flying mount?</i>

<i>Is Ghost Story going to make available the system for a two-person flying mount?</i>

<i>Doesn't the game want to make money?</i>

144

So these are the Paired Lovebirds?

145
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,050
However, it seems to be a little fat. Can it really fly?

146
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,440
Come. Let's have a look around.

147
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,600
<i>I'm finding out that whenever people think Luwei Weiwei is at her most miserable,</i>

148
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,160
<i>she turns it into a moment of glory and envy in no time.</i>

149
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,920
<i>That's true. Last time, when she and Zhenshui Wuxiang dissolved their marriage, I thought that she was dumped.</i>

150
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,050
<i>But as a result, in the blink of an eye, she formed a couple with Yixiao Naihe.</i>

151
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,450
<i>So formidable.</i>

152
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,860
<i>Could it be that Zhenshui Wuxiang was actually the one who was dumped?</i>

153
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,020
How did you find me?

154
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,420
There were actually some tips.

155
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,750
Could the Lovelorn Maneuver be the long-rumored Cosmic Elemental Maneuver?

156
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,840
It wasn't as mythical as that. Before I entered, there was an NPC who explained to me how to proceed.
<i>(Note: NPC means Non-Player Character)</i>

157
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,250
About 1,000 - 2,000 words worth of tips were shown for approximately 10 seconds.

158
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,250
Did you actually memorize all those tips within 10 seconds?

159
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,430
That's too inhuman of you, isn't it? Even if you can take in ten lines at a glance, it still isn't possible.

160
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,930
I took a screenshot.

161
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,820
Of course. You can take a screenshot.

162
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,080
Only an idiot would try to memorize them.

163
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,490
I'm an idiot. My brain actually isn't working anymore.

164
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,500
However, it's still pretty impressive for you to take a screenshot within that short amount of time.

165
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,150
Did you leave your guild?

166
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, I left a few days ago.

167
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,520
<i>Luwei Weiwei, your team stole the kill (kill-steal) of Xiaoyu Qingqing's boss.
(MMORPG T/N: kill-stealing is the practice of obtaining credit for a kill, when another player has put more effort into the kill.)</i>

168
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,530
<i>However you look at it, we are all part of the same guild. There's no excuse for what you did.</i>

169
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,520
<i>Shouldn't you give me an explanation?</i>

170
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,930
<i>When did Xiaoyu Qingqing become part of our guild?</i>

171
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,980
<i>Because of Zhenshui and Xiaoyu Yaoyao, the guild leader accepted the Xiaoyu clan as part of the guild.</i>

172
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,250
<i>But this Xiaoyu Qingqing is especially despicable.</i>

173
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,200
<i>She's always acting coquettishly and is like a spoiled child towards the males in the guild.</i>

174
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,650
<i>She even clung onto the guild leader a while ago.</i>

175
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,410
<i>I've already seen those two alone together several times.</i>

176
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,010
<i>They even rode on the same horse together.</i>

177
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,920
<i>Guild Leader Zhan, why don't you ask Xiaoyu Qingqing what really happened?</i>

178
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,530
<i>It would be best if she gave me an explanation.</i>

179
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,280
<i>Luwei, what do you mean by that? I know that you are biased against Xiaoyu Qingqing.</i>

180
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,210
<i>However, I hope that you can deal with this situation objectively.</i>

181
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,950
<i>- How am I not dealing with this situation objectively?
- Hey! You– </i>

182
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,910
<i>Xiaoyu Qingqing, please come here for a moment</i>

183
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,850
<i>and explain clearly what happened to Guild Leader Zhan.</i>

184
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,150
<i>Xiaoyu Qingqing, come out quickly.</i>

185
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,870
<i>Xiaoyu Qingqing, if you're not willing to speak, I'll ask on the Global Chat.</i>

186
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,170
<i>At that time, there were many teams present. I believe that someone will be willing to</i>

187
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,530
<i>explain the situation at that time.</i>

188
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,560
<i>I just went out. What's happening?</i>

189
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,060
<i>Why are you pretending like you don't know? Isn't it all there in the chat history?</i>

190
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,260
<i>This issue? I was just talking about stealing a boss.</i>

191
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,670
<i>I didn't get it and said that you stole the boss away.</i>

192
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,560
<i>Did I say anything wrong?</i>

193
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,770
<i>I didn't realize that Tianxia would misunderstand and run to ask you about it.</i>

194
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,850
<i>Based on what you just said, Guild Leader Zhan deliberately misinterpreted your words to slander me.</i>

195
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,260
<i>Guild Leader Zhan, then you should give me an explanation.</i>

196
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,750
<i>It's really uncomfortable to be wrongly accused by someone.</i>

197
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,360
<i>Xiaoyu Qingqing is trying to take you down through someone else's knife.</i>

198
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,250
<i>Then isn't this knife that she wants to use too dull?</i>

199
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,590
<i>I got it wrong. It's for the best that it was only a misunderstanding.</i>

200
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,330
<i>The unity of the guild is of the utmost importance.</i>

201
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,680
<i>But there's one issue that you should pay attention to, Luwei Weiwei.</i>

202
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,940
<i>What is it? Please tell me.</i>

203
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,970
<i>During Zhenshui and Yaoyao's marriage ceremony,</i>

204
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,740
<i>those potions that you were selling at the Vermilion Sparrow Bridge</i>

205
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,400
<i>were made using the ingredients of the guild, right?</i>

206
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,660
<i>Logically speaking, they shouldn't be for sale by individuals.</i>

207
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,320
<i>But since it happened only this once, it's no big deal. Just be aware of this next time and don't do it again.</i>

208
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,790
<i>Guild Leader Zhan still remembers something that happened so long ago.</i>

209
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,140
<i>If I remember correctly, these so-called "herbs of the guild" in the guild warehouse</i>

210
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,020
<i>were actually gathered by me. I used herbs that I gathered to make potions for sale,</i>

211
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,120
<i>yet, Guild Leader Zhan, you have objections?</i>

212
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,030
<i>That's not it. Luwei, using it like that–</i>

213
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,220
<i>Enough, enough. We're all in the same guild.</i>

214
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,060
<i>Peace brings about fortune.</i>

215
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
<i>- We're all the same guild.
- That's right.</i>

216
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
<i>Forget it. Forget it.</i>

217
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,570
<i>Xiaoyu Qingqing, as for what really happened,</i>

218
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,630
<i>we both know what really took place.</i>

219
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,650
<i>Either you apologize to me now,</i>

220
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,060
<i>or, in the future, don't let me see you kill a boss.</i>

221
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,360
<i>Or else, I'll turn your accusation today into a reality.</i>

222
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,620
<i>Luwei Weiwei!</i>

223
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>Your excessive bullying is intolerable!</i>

224
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,310
<i>Would anyone make a mountain out of a mole hill like you?</i>

225
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,710
<i>From your high-level, are you looking down on us? We already said it was a misunderstanding.</i>

226
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,260
<i>Do you have to bully others when you get the chance?</i>

227
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,470
<i>Tianxia, I didn't do it on purpose. Why is she so mean?</i>

228
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,060
<i>This is no longer the Jade Seas Guild I'm familiar with.</i>

229
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,250
<i>Weiwei, don't be impulsive.</i>

230
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,080
<i>Things that need to be said have all been said.</i>

231
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,420
<i>Friends, if we meet again outside,</i>

232
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,300
<i>we'll still be friends.</i>

233
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,630
<i>Luwei Weiwei is leaving this guild.</i>

234
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,150
<i>- What?
- What's going on?</i>

235
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,350
<i>All things must eventually end.</i>

236
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,170
<i>Luwei Weiwei is withdrawn from Jade Seas Guild.</i>

237
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,350
<i>- This is way over the line!
- Why is she doing this?</i>

238
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,510
<i>- Right?
- That's right.</i>

239
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,330
It's fine this way. In the future, we'll be together.

240
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,540
Yup! Then we'll journey this world together

241
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,370
as a rogue couple.

242
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,130
Rogue couple?

243
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,470
I remember we had an official wedding ceremony.

244
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,380
You really have no sense of humor.

245
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,850
Social status is very important.

246
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,530
<i>Fine. Master really does have a sense of humor.</i>

247
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,770
<i>It's just a little lame.</i>

248
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,760
<i>Even though it's a view that I've become used to seeing,</i>

249
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,890
<i>and even when I see it every day,</i>

250
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,370
<i>the feeling can still be different.</i>

251
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,600
<i>Just like right now.</i>

252
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,240
<i>The name has been changed?</i>

253
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,160
Hey, Weiwei. This mask from Mask Family isn't bad.

254
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,900
Weiwei.

255
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,910
I heard you.

256
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,990
You wouldn't be in the game

257
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,590
doing that? Right?

258
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,990
Don't worry. I've already finished the test papers and completed the revisions of the thesis.

259
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,370
- This won't interfere with exams.
- Who's worrying about your exams?

260
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,190
Who's worrying about your test papers?

261
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,260
I'm just worrying that you'll get taken by someone.

262
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,210
Bei Weiwei, don't you feel that the way you look now

263
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,060
resembles someone who's really in love?

264
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,340
- Just enjoy your mask.
- That's what I am doing.

265
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,120
Xiao Yu.

266
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,360
Director Li. My apologies.

267
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,720
The traffic around our capital city is really awful.

268
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,050
I took a taxi and the driver took extra care in helping me.

269
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,750
It's nothing. I also just arrived. Come. Have a seat.

270
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,040
- What do you want to drink?
- Anything is fine.
- Okay.

271
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,810
Waiter.

272
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,150
Xiao Yu, did you come by taxi today?

273
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,610
Yes, that's why I was delayed a little on the way.

274
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,640
Hey, someone as talented as you shouldn't be living like this.

275
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,650
The core technical staff of our company

276
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,560
are all provided with a company car and housing subsidy.

277
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,950
Really? Is their compensation that attractive?

278
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,320
They're talents. We have to treat them well.

279
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,910
Take the technical staff member who came to our company the year before last as an example.

280
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,860
He even bought a house this year.

281
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,350
He even bought a house?

282
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:22,460
You also know that the salary and benefits of our company are the best in the industry.

283
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,460
Xiao Yu, let us get straight to the point today.

284
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,400
I won't beat around the bush with you.

285
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Ever since we met last time,

286
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,740
our company has our eyes on you in particular.

287
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,230
What do you think? Do you have any interest in joining our company?

288
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,320
Director Li, this is a really tempting offer,

289
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,550
but I am really attached to this product I am working on.

290
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,080
Why don't we do this? Let's wait until our game is brought to the market,

291
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,880
and then I will come over. It still sounds reasonable that way.

292
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,200
Xiao Yu, you are just too rigid.

293
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,920
Why won't you collaborate with us and develop this product together?

294
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,330
We especially like this idea of yours.

295
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,930
As long as we execute it well,

296
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,670
it will definitely set a new legendary record of one hundred million in monthly sales.

297
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,430
However, this is CEO Xiao's product.

298
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,020
I actually feel that the majority of it

299
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,860
is the result of your hard labor.

300
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,120
Director Li, CEO Xiao and I are classmates living in the same dorm.

301
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,780
That's right. Just because you are classmates,

302
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,590
should you be content to remain as the second fiddle?

303
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,930
Moreover, in my opinion, your abilities are just as good as his.

304
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,810
Young people should give themselves an additional option

305
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,930
and another possibility. Don't you agree?

306
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,380
In addition, as a team of only college students,

307
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,540
you have absolutely no experience and connections.

308
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,620
I don't need to say this and you understand this in your heart as well.

309
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,170
How many challenges will you all face in the future?

310
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,200
The possibility of success is very small.

311
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,290
However, if you team up with us, you will create a miracle.

312
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,270
<i>[120,000]</i>

313
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,020
This is only the monthly salary. After a project succeeds, there is also a commission.

314
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,350
I hope that you can feel

315
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,530
that I have come with the utmost sincerity representing our company.

316
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,360
What? He says that he still needs some time to consider the offer?

317
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,490
Time is money! We can't wait for him.

318
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,060
Let's do this. After a couple of days, look him up again,

319
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,510
and raise the signing bonus

320
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,220
to 30%.

321
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,730
That's right. We absolutely have to bring him over.

322
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,820
Once he comes over, just like pulling a radish out of the ground with dirt,

323
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,850
his whole team will also come over. Do you understand?

324
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,230
Yiran.

325
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,020
Remember to knock next time you come in.

326
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,100
Uncle, do you really want to poach Yu Banshan and the others?

327
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,550
Let me tell you. You must keep this a secret. What you just heard

328
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,920
must not be repeated outside. You have to know your boundary in your job.

329
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,290
Then, Xiao Nai...!

330
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,930
Uncle, isn't what you're doing too unethical?

331
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,010
Unethical?

332
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,980
So you think this is unethical?

333
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,710
You're still young.

334
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,840
You simply can't understand the logic in business.

335
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,020
Those college students think that they can succeed just because of a good idea.

336
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,510
Have a look out there. Cases of failure are all over the place.

337
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,920
How many actually succeeded?

338
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,260
It's not uncommon for the young folks to lose their way.

339
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,490
At this time, they need us as their seniors to advise them

340
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,930
so that they won't waste their time and money.

341
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,750
Uncle, then if you're luring Yu Banshan and the others to come over,

342
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,200
what will happen to Xiao Nai?

343
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,500
I will first bring over all the members of his team,

344
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,090
and then give him some better terms.

345
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,480
Will Xiao Nai still be able to refuse coming over?

346
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,430
Do you still not believe in your uncle's ability?

347
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,610
Just stop foolishly worrying about this. Right now, the most important thing for you is

348
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,100
to learn well. Do you understand?

349
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,160
Say... why has Yugong been gone for so long? Could he have become interested?

350
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,840
Na Na.

351
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,350
So, you just went to the male dorm

352
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,890
because you want to tell XIao Nai about all this?

353
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,050
I even saw him,

354
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,170
but I still hesitated, unsure if I should tell him or not.

355
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,160
It's good you didn't.

356
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,660
Yiran, this definitely is your sixth sense helping you. Hey,

357
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,680
have you lost your mind?

358
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,310
This situation, irregardless if the poaching is successful or not,

359
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,030
in any case, your uncle has already played the bad guy.

360
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,050
If unsuccessful, we'll think of another plan.

361
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,270
If successful,

362
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,490
then you can work together with Xiao Nai, right? Therefore, I feel

363
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,790
you should stay on CEO Zhen's side.

364
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,850
But I still feel...

365
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,150
- How did Xiao Nai and Bei Weiwei–
- Okay, okay.

366
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,490
I already investigated this situation for you.

367
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,890
Those two just happened to sit together by coincidence.

368
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,880
Furthermore, Xiao Nai completely ignored Bei Weiwei.

369
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,470
My showing you this is to tell you

370
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,590
you have to create your own opportunity!

371
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,130
Opportunities won't fall on your lap when you just sit there without doing anything.

372
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,870
Speaking of Bei Weiwei, as a Computer Science student,

373
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,040
she went to an archaeology lecture in order to accost Xiao Nai. Isn't she trying hard or not?

374
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,810
Whereas you just sit here, and are not proactive at all.

375
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,660
Do you believe Xiao Nai will fall out of the sky to come to you?

376
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,290
In any case, I feel that you have such a good opportunity, yet you want to stop it.

377
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,180
Tell me. Have you lost your mind?

378
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,610
Yiran, just don't oppose your uncle any longer.

379
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,900
As for you, just quietly

380
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,320
stand behind CEO Zhen and support him. That will be enough.

381
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,020
In any case, you'll be the good guy at the end no matter what. Okay?

382
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,660
I feel that with my acting, I practically could be the best actor in the film industry.

383
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,530
My acting depicted a college student's struggle between ideals and money

384
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,840
so intricately and brilliantly.

385
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,470
"Director Li, your terms are truly attractive to me.

386
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,450
However, I am just too attached to our product."

387
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,820
"Xiao Yu,

388
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,330
this here... is just the monthly salary.

389
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,400
After the product succeeds, there will also be a commission.

390
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,390
I hope you can understand.

391
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,390
I, as the representative of our company,

392
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,370
have come with sincerity."

393
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,690
With my acting skill, if I don't work as a programmer, I can surely have a career in show business!

394
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,640
Say, they are really ruthless.

395
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,730
They went so far as to get Old Yu to take the source code with him.

396
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,060
This way, they can, within a short period of time,

397
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,210
develop a game that's an exact replica of ours.

398
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,680
If they get to the market first, our work will be a complete waste.

399
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,110
Third Brother, what's the next step?

400
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,310
You told me not to refuse and stall first.

401
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,240
Could it be that you want me to go to their company as a spy? Pow!

402
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,430
Big Brother, with your IQ, if you were to spy...

403
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,300
Don't make me laugh, okay?

404
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,160
In my opinion, it's more possible for them to send a spy over to us.

405
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,660
Third Brother, what are you really thinking?

406
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm thinking... it's very likely they'll try to take away all our options

407
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,830
and obstruct us from obtaining financing from other companies.

408
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,520
Hey, what's this?

409
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,510
The live picture of the renovated office of our company. The designer just sent it over.

410
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,820
The delivery should be pretty soon for our use.

411
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,760
Time surely flies.

412
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,780
We'll finally have our own base of operations!

413
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,070
I don't have any other requests, but we must hire an

414
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,050
extremely beautiful receptionist. A girl.

415
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,040
Okay?

416
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,010
It's probably not possible.

417
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,710
Why?

418
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,180
I recruited an expert programmer. His name is Ah Shuang.

419
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,480
On another day, I'll introduce him to you guys.

420
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,980
But you...

421
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,080
Third Brother! Hey, Third Brother!

422
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,150
Is there any relation to finding an expert programmer to having a girl as the receptionist?

423
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,420
He has a phobia of women.

424
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,220
He what? What's this now?

425
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,950
Brother Mei, my condolences.

426
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,970
I think just now, I unexpectedly heard these words, "phobia of women."

427
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,830
It seems that our company will once again become a Buddhist monastery.

428
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,630
Oh, Heavens!

429
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,670
In this world, how can a man with such a strange problem exist?

430
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,660
Okay, okay. Calm down, calm down.

431
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,220
In this world, there are men who don't like stinky socks.

432
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,080
What's so strange about a man who doesn't like beautiful women?

433
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,930
Third Brother, you said they may obstruct our financing. What do you mean?

434
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,420
Besides poaching the team, they definitely have a backup plan.

435
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:52,020
In the gaming circle, they have more connections than we do. It's easy for them to spread rumors.

436
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,420
Brother Mei, this society is full of danger.

437
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,570
I don't want to graduate.

438
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,290
Be good. Be good. Don't fear. You have to believe

439
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,090
that Third Brother will be, compared to them,

440
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,290
- more evil!
- Hey,

441
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,960
had we known earlier, we wouldn't have agreed to the meeting. Then we wouldn't have this trouble.

442
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,770
When in possession of treasure, you will inevitably attract some hungry wolves. It can't be avoided.

443
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,560
Yes, that's right.

444
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Unless, we hide and take care of it ourselves.

445
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,570
- But our goal isn't just this one game.
- Yeah.

446
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,700
At first, I didn't directly refuse Zhen Yi because I wanted to stall for time.

447
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,830
I never wanted to team up with this company from the start.

448
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,100
Going to negotiate was only to test their bottom line.

449
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,420
Test?

450
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,160
News of Feng Teng Technologies looking for outside teams

451
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,920
to develop a new "Chinese Ghost Story" has already been leaked.

452
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,260
Zhen Yi is very ambitious in this area,

453
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,360
and maybe our greatest competitor.

454
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,840
Then when you went to discuss the mobile game, that was also a ruse?

455
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,050
Understanding your opponent's behavior is very necessary.

456
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,530
Brother Hou, Brother Mei, listen to me.

457
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,790
If we just mindlessly follow Third Brother, there will be no problems.

458
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,110
However, Third Brother, were you really not concerned that we would be lured away?

459
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,950
If they could lure you guys away, they could definitely get me as well.

460
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,670
Listening to what you're saying... I'm quite touched.

461
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,090
Anyone interested in a PK? Whoever wins, gets first pick of offices.

462
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,470
I knew feeling touched was definitely an illusion!

463
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,480
These are math problems for seniors in high school, yet you got all of them right?

464
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
A wish, a wish.

465
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,360
Before I grant your wish, you already knew that

466
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,420
you had already trapped me. Right?

467
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,100
Talk. What wish?

468
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,990
Sister Weiwei, I saw that you brought your computer today.

469
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,530
That's right. Before I came, I was in the library working on homework.

470
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,280
So, I want to watch Sister playing games.

471
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,820
No way. According to our agreement,

472
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,410
today isn't your time to play games.

473
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,260
This is an important principle. You can't violate it.

474
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,740
Choose a different wish.

475
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,700
Then... Then I'll move next week's gaming time to today.

476
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,490
Just this once.

477
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,930
Wow, Red Clothed Lady Blade Master?

478
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,740
Sister Weiwei, you're so cool!

479
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,560
Someone's calling you.

480
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,500
<i>"Yixiao Naihe: Weiwei, come kill a boss."</i>

481
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,570
Who is this Yixiao Naihe?

482
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,180
He's my friend in the game.

483
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,080
How exciting!

484
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,300
However, there are a couple of players called Xiaoyu something already fighting the boss.

485
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,320
Xiao Yang, you're really lucky to see this.

486
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,910
You get to see the first time I'll kill-steal a boss from someone else in the game.
<i>(MMORPG T/N: kill-stealing is the practice of obtaining credit for a kill, when another player has put more effort into the kill.)</i>

487
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,110
Kill-stealing other's bosses... isn't this bad?
<i>(T/N: Kill-stealing is considered a dishonorable practice.)</i>

488
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,570
Of course it's bad, so don't copy me.

489
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,050
However, this Xiaoyu Qingqing framed me a few days ago,

490
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,220
accusing me of kill-stealing a boss from them.

491
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,290
She was exposed but wouldn't admit it no matter what. So tell me what I should do.

492
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,300
Kill-steal their boss a hundred times! Sister Weiwei, I support you. Hey!

493
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,790
Hey, look. They've all run away.

494
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,490
Wow! Hey, the boss has fallen. Quickly open the reward chest.

495
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,090
Open it and see what's in it.

496
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,520
Rare Element Diamond?

497
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,930
Is it really awesome?

498
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,170
The system even produced an announcement. Tell me. Is that awesome, or not?

499
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,210
Wow... Sister Weiwei, your game is really so much fun.

500
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,870
Can you let me play for a while?

501
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,750
Did you have this idea from the beginning?

502
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,990
Okay, just a little while. I'll tell my friend.

503
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,150
He'll lead you to play.

504
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,540
I'll do this. You can work on other things.

505
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,230
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

506
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,010
<i>Too amazing. Sister Weiwei,</i>

507
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,620
this Yixiao Naihe is too amazing at PK.

508
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,200
I can't beat him.

509
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,850
Tell him to go easy on you. Say you're a little kid.

510
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,090
I don't want to. I'm a real man,

511
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,930
so I must PK with honor and fairness.

512
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,490
Sister Weiwei, a lot of people are cursing at you!

513
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,090
They say you stole a boss.

514
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,400
That Xiaoyu Qingqing who framed you last time is pretending to be hurt on the world chat.

515
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,000
She's saying that you bullied a delicate maiden like them.

516
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,820
Wow! They also want you to give back the diamond.

517
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,560
<i>Sister, hurry and come to take a look!</i>

518
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,690
I'll come in a moment.

519
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,040
Let me see.

520
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,070
Hey, Sister, look at this quickly. This player is saying that Xiaoyu Qingqing was the one stealing the boss.

521
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,560
What you did was called intervening when seeing an injustice.

522
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,970
Xiaoyu Qingqing isn't owning up!

523
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,190
Hey, Sister, quickly look. This player

524
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,120
posted a video.

525
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,150
Now, it's good. The Xiaoyu clan no longer dare to speak.

526
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,920
Even in the world chat, no one dares to spew nonsense.

527
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,820
Tone it down a bit.

528
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,540
This Xiaoyu Qingqing tries so hard to act hurt.

529
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,860
Who doesn't know how to act hurt? Watch.

530
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,170
<i>All this time, I haven't said anything.</i>

531
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,210
<i>I thought the innocent would remain innocent, and the impure would be shown as impure.</i>

532
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,460
<i>However, after experiencing so many people's condemnation, I suddenly feel so discouraged.</i>

533
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,700
How is it? Grieved enough?

534
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,470
<i>Not bad, not bad. Innocent flower skill acquired.</i>

535
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,080
<i>Top offer to acquire the diamond permanently.</i>

536
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,650
Third Brother is also talking in the world chat!

537
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,460
<i>- Let's take a group photo!
- Expert, give me an autograph, okay?</i>

538
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,100
<i>Hey, Yixiao, are you also collecting the diamond to raise your weapon level?</i>

539
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,030
<i>Not interested.</i>

540
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,440
<i>Then why are you collecting it?</i>

541
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,560
<i>To give to my wife to play with.</i>

542
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,750
<i>Third-Sister-in-Law, aren't you happy?</i>

543
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,700
<i>I bet Xiaoyu Qingqing must be annoyed to death.</i>

544
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,530
<i>I'm happy. By the way, that Juishi Buchifan is your alternate account, right?
(Note: means "Just not eating a meal")</i>

545
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,280
<i>Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental, just as we go to steal,</i>

546
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,660
<i>that alternate account happened to record the encounter?</i>

547
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,150
<i>It belongs to Yugong and the others.</i>

548
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,470
<i>The three of us created alternate accounts to steal bosses,</i>

549
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,270
<i>specifically to steal Xiaoyu Qingqing's.</i>

550
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,070
<i>We stole three before she finally couldn't bear it and killed us.</i>

551
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,220
<i>Hurry up and compliment us.</i>

552
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,510
<i>Sinister, so sinister.</i>

553
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,320
<i>It was Third Brother who instructed us.</i>

554
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,420
<i>We've been wronged...</i>

555
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,670
<i>Master is so amazing!</i>

556
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,870
<i>This difference in treatment!</i>

557
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,450
<i>I really have to bow down to you.</i>

558
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,660
