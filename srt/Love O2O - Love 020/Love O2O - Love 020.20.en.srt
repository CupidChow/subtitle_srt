25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,650
Hello, Weiwei. What is it? I'm busy.

26
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,540
I have good news. Your metal forging skill is going up super fast,

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,810
but I left the last bit for you. It's more meaningful that way.

28
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,730
Wow. Weiwei, you're amazing! You're ten times faster than I!

29
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,390
No, no. A hundred times faster.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,200
Also, I ran into your Weiguang in the game just now.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,060
No way! He said he was busy and hasn't been online for days.

32
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,410
Weiwei! You didn't tell him you're not me, right?

33
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,400
Don't! I don't want him to think that I am not the one who created the gift.

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,100
So it is for him.

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,240
Don't you worry. I'm so smart and bailed right away.

36
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,050
Then I'm relieved. Weiwei, you're truly my angel.

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,750
I'll bring you rice with beef.

38
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,780
That's not necessary.

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,610
I think I'll get my dinner.

40
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,520
I knew it! You will have dinner with your Master, Xiao Nai.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,980
<i>I know!</i>

42
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,750
Busy? You're just having dinner with Xiao Nai!

43
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,210
You sure have enough charm to string two men along.

44
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,000
Next time your Master invites you for a meal–

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Can't you keep it down? Don't you know I'm busy?

46
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,920
I should go. A mental case is having an episode.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,560
Sir, hello. Goodbye, sir.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,870
The kitty has been bathed. This laborer is leaving.

49
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,400
Wait! Who said you can leave?

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,770
What now?

51
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,680
Are you done? Did you blow dry the cat? Fill the food bowl? Scoop the poop?

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,160
Dried, filled,

53
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,390
but the poop hasn't been scooped up yet.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,390
It stinks so much!

55
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,820
I just cleaned and you're taking a dump?

56
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,910
Like owner, like pet.

57
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,490
You're ganging up on me, aren't you?

58
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,100
Come out of there! Take a dump after I leave!

59
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,640
I told you to come out!

60
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,100
What are you screaming about?

61
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,080
Your cat bit me. I spilled a lot of blood.

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,720
Why are you so clumsy?

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,110
It's fine.

64
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,480
Cao Guang?

65
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,500
This will hurt a bit. Bear with it.

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,290
This is a workplace injury, right? Do I get compensation?

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,450
Are you even thinking about money now?

68
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,300
You're just like your name suggests, crass!

69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,200
If you're so classy, then don't make me repay the debt.

70
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,170
Do you think I'll get rabies?

71
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm so young, just starting out my career,

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,800
yet I got injured out of the blue.

73
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,590
If anything happens to me,

74
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,470
it's as if Heaven is envious of a genius!

75
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,640
This will be a huge loss for the IT industry.

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,400
Or no! It'll be a huge loss for the culinary world.

77
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,840
Coffee is vaccinated every year. The probability of an infection is low.

78
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,030
- Unless...
- Unless what?

79
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,490
Unless he's been fooling around.

80
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,820
Okay, I'll take you to get the shot.

81
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,860
Has the rabies virus invaded your brain already?

82
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,140
Why are you sitting there like a fool?

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,770
Can I skip the shot?

84
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,090
What?

85
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,910
Can I...

86
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,660
I want to offset the debt with the cost of the shot.

87
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,360
Zhao Erxi!

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,070
I just thought you were a warrior who was willing to put your life on the line.

89
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,510
It turns out that for a mere five cents, you would ignore your own life like an idi–

90
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,000
You'd better not say it!

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,040
What? Come on! The hospital will close soon.

92
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,760
The probability of the infection from rabies is very low.

93
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,990
For someone lucky like me, I wouldn't contract it.

94
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,300
However, I am 100% on the hook for the debt.

95
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,580
No matter how small the probability, we have to worry about prevention.

96
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,350
Is your life only worth three grand?

97
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,430
Do you mean, if I don't get the shot, I don't have to repay the money?

98
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,020
Is your brain wired differently from normal people? Let's hurry up and go.

99
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,240
I won't go.

100
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,220
Can't you work with me?

101
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,150
Just think. Once the shot is given, all that money goes down the drain.

102
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,800
Such a horrifying sound!

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,770
I'll use my credit card. You won't feel a thing.

104

Okay, sit over here and rest.

107
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,810
Cao Guang, I don't want to get the shot.

108
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,110
The money has already been paid and the medicine prescribed. Isn't it a bit late to go AWOL?

109
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,570
Forget about offsetting the debt. I don't want to get the shot.

110
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,020
Umm... I think there is an issue with the person giving the shot. Everyone cries when getting the shot.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,230
Okay, stop whining. It'll be your turn soon.

I don't want the shot. I don't want the shot.

I don't want the shot. I don't want the shot. I don't want the shot.

You won't go, right?

Cao Guang? Why do you have Erxi's phone?

126
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,720
It's a long story. Erxi got bit by my cat.

127

<i> I brought her to the hospital, but she refuses to get the rabies shot.</i>

128
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,180
Is her injury serious?

129
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,840
It's a small wound, but she bled. She has to get the shot,

130
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,830
but she's too stubborn. She won't listen to me. Why don't you come and talk to her?

131
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,870
Which hospital are you guys in? I'll be there right away.

132
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,990
We're at the Blue Sky Community Hospital.

133
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,590
Okay.

134
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,850
I don't think it's warm.

135
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,290
Hello?

136
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,690
What do you want to eat tonight? I'll bring it over.

137
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,150
You don't need to come. Erxi got bit by a cat.

138
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,600
She's in the hospital. I'm going to see her.

139
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,880
Which hospital? I'll come to get you.

140
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,420
All right.

141
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,730
Come with me.

142
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,550
Did he fall into a hole?

143
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,940
When did you leave? Give me back my phone.

144
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,150
- Weiwei.
- Let me see your wound.

145
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,700
Is your cat vaccinated?

146
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,980
Yes, but there's still a possibility for the infection.

147
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,060
Be good and get the shot.

148
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,400
It's over ¥1,000. That's my living expenses for two months.

149
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,450
Also, I'm sure it'll be fine. Why should I waste this money?

150
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,410
You're so annoying!

151
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,340
Can't you just deduct it from my debt?

152
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,140
So whiny! Is he even like a man? Even getting Weiwei to come here.

153
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,210
What debt?

154
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,950
It was when we were making the graduation video.

155
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,450
We broke the camcorder.

156
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,190
It's not we. It's you. You. Just you.

157
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,820
Anyway, just the two of us split it equally.

158
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,220
He paid for it first,

159
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,390
then had me feed his cat to pay off the debt.

160
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,760
How much do you owe?

161
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,140
I've already returned ¥2,000. I still need ¥3,000.

162
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,180
- I have some money at home. Why don't I pay it for you first?
- No need, Weiwei!

163
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,520
Enough! Who needs you to pay?

164
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,250
What's wrong with Cao Guang?

165
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,430
Who cares what's with him? Just get the shot with me.

166
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,640
I'm not going, Weiwei!

167
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,260
Listen to me!

168
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,350
Let's go!

169
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,100
Weiwei! It can't be!

170
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,960
To make me get the shot, you even disturbed Master Xiao?

171
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,460
He couldn't have run into Cao Guang at the entrance, could he? His rival in love?

172
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,950
I suddenly want to get the shot.

173
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,020
I didn't know how Erxi and Cao Guang would...

174
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,000
You have a fever.

175
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,520
You didn't sound right on the phone and you don't even feel hot while wearing so much.

176
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,730
Didn't you know you have a fever?

177
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,300
It doesn't feel hot.

178
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,420
Weiwei.

179
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,930
Weiwei, you finally woke up!

180
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,780
What's going on? Did you get your shot?

181
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,870
Don't worry about me. Let's see if you still have a fever.

182
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,060
It still feels a little hot.

183
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,110
You fainted just now. You scared me and Master.

184
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,480
You still have a fever. Sleep some more.

185
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm so tired! I'm going to bed!

186
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,930
I won't disturb you two.

187
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,410
She's normally quite normal.

188
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,200
Your roommate has always been bright and sharp.

189
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,710
Where's your thermometer? Bring it out. Let's check again.

190
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,000
<i>[First aid kit]</i>

191
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,360
39 degrees.

192
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,740
Why is it back so quickly?

193
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,340
It was clearly not hot before.

194
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,180
You lectured others for not getting a shot but what about you?

195
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,070
Go to your room and lay down.

196
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,620
I'm going to get some water.

197
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,750
<i>♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫</i>

198
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,490
<i>♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫</i>

199

205
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,910
You don't have to worry about me.

206
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,840
I actually don't feel that bad.

207
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,160
From my past experiences, I don't need to take any medicine.

208
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,720
I'll definitely be fine tomorrow.

209
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

210
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,910
You should head back earlier.

211
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,200
Just go ahead and leave. Don't forget to shut the door when you leave.

212
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,130
<i>♫ Our fate just happens to not let anyone else disturb us ♫</i>

213
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,490
I'm leaving now.

214
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,030
<i>♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫</i>

217
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,840
<i>♫ You are so important to me ♫</i>

218
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,520
<i>♫ You are so important to me ♫</i>

219
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,060
It can't be.

220
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,700
You're still here.

221
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,710
You don't want to take medicine.

222
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,690
Your fever might get worse tonight. I'm going to stay for a while.

223
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,290
I think I'm better now.

224
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,730
Your fever's gone.

225
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,980
I've thought about it.

226
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,630
I should keep you next to me in the future.

227
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,930
What?

228
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,930
Don't you like following me around in the game? Continue doing it.

229
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:04,700
But... I haven't finished Ah Shuang's assignment for me.

230
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,290
Forget about him.

231
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,970
I am worried about you.

232
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,290
Our mobile game had compatibility issues on certain types of phones but we have already fixed them.

233
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,190
But the problems on two of the brands might be attributed to their SIM card.

234
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,480
There will be a black screen after a while.

235
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,300
There are fewer of these two brands of phone in the market. I thought perhaps we don't need to find a fix for it.

236
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,950
This morning I talked to Feng Teng. The news conference has been moved up to the end of September.

237
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,090
If there are other problems, resolve them as soon as possible.

238
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,630
Okay.

239
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,710
After going fast track for a month,

240
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,830
we have completed our preliminary demo,

241
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,910
but we still need to optimize certain areas.

242
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,610
For example, the flow of the fighting scenes.

243
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,190
I don't think we need to rush this much.

244
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,530
The movement flow and connections of our game already surpassed other games.

245
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,930
Besides, other than Third Brother's abnormal eyesight,

246
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,690
who else could detect those tiny skips?

247
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,230
Anyway, I'm confident we can get this project.

248
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,390
Why don't we just wait until the optimization is done?

249
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,930
I'll do it.

250
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,140
Forget it. Forget it. I'll do it.

251
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,600
You have your own work to do.

252
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,810
But this game is for everyone to play.

253
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,590
With our type of game, would the low-end video cards be able to handle it?

254
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,980
That's why I've decided to further our optimization algorithm,

255
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,090
under the same pixel resolution,

256
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,930
do all we can to compress the modeling surfaces and graphics.

257
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,620
Wow!

258
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,570
Third Brother, isn't this too masochistic for a human being?

259
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,680
Are you doing it yourself?

260
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,260
The concept isn't that difficult, but it will need a lot of time.

261
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,630
We have a tight schedule. I can take it home and work on it.

262
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,400
A little more than a month is not too much of a rush.

263
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,180
We'll end here today. Right, Ah Shuang.

264
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,830
I want to get your opinion on something.

265
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,810
I don't have enough people working with me recently.

266
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,870
I want to borrow from you some folks who work for you.

267
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,230
Weiwei, are you all better?

268
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,090
Yes, I recovered quickly.

269
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,460
Obviously, your Master has cast a tender spell on you.

270
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,860
Wrong. It's psychotherapy.

271
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,930
I can see the release of Master's demo today.

272
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,570
Watch out for your goddess image.

273
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,780
Yes, please begin your meal.

274
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,330
I said goddess, not maid.

275
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,470
This is called love makes a person crazy.

276
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,500
You're going to work today, too.

277
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,390
I'm going. After I get my wages,

278
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm going to slap that Cao Guang!

279
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,030
I've transferred it to you this morning.

280
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,430
What?

281
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,330
Pay Cao Guang off first.

282
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,690
Then I'll be your biggest creditor.

283
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,080
Hurry and make money. I only have ¥600 left for living expenses.

284
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,750
Weiwei, this is great.

285
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,950
So I must be your U.LoveIt?
<i>(Note: U.LoveIt is a famous brand for bubble tea)</i>

286
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,400
I don't want to cuddle you in the palm of my hands.
(Note: Pun based on the lines in the commercial of U.LoveIt)

287
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,260
Tell me about these things sooner next time.

288
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,550
You're too great!

289
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,010
Okay, you're crushing your creditor! Let go and eat your breakfast.

290
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,760
- Third Sister-in-Law, are you better now?
- Yes, much better.

291
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,960
You look well.

292
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,700
- Here.
- Thanks.

293
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,030
You've finally made it through.

294
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,760
Third Brother has finally adopted you.

295
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,990
Senior Brother, can you not be so mysterious when you talk?

296
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,810
Don't worry about the details.

297
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,640
I've prepared some orange juice. Drink fruit juice every day.

298
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,420
I guarantee you'll be as beautiful as a goddess. The third Brother will be forever faithful to you.

299
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,120
You have to build up your body by eating well. The two of you

300
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,920
will live for a long, long time–

301
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,340
Will you let it go? What is Third Brother like?

302
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,050
You don't know how cruel Third Brother can be.

303
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,760
I can faintly feel

304
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,000
Third Sister-in-Law is preparing to experience even greater torture.

305
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,860
You don't know jack.

306
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,380
Third Brother's heart aches.

307
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,730
Right, right.

308
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,610
<i>My heart aches.</i>

309
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,460
Ah Shuang, I'll still finish the task you gave me.

310
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,560
N-No need.

311
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,430
I started it, so I should finish it.

312
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:28,850
But I still think it would be more effective to use the background app.

313
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,290
I hope you will agree with my idea.

314
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,020
It's like this...

315
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,460
I admit that I made things hard for you on purpose.

316
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,610
But why did you still buy medicine for me?

317
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,500
It's not a big deal to buy you medicine.

318
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,820
Third Sister-in-Law, you're just too honest.

319
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,270
You gave him a little bit of consolation and then snatched it away.

320
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,480
What am I doing here?

321
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,800
She said she was thirsty so I got her some juice. I was actually very busy.

322
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,140
Why is my phone gone? Where's my phone?

323
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,390
Come to my office at lunchtime. I'll use break time

324
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,310
to show you how our game demo is coming along.

325
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,890
Okay.

326
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,510
This is a display of our demo's artistic style. Give its skill settings a try.

327
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,230
Wait a minute. I'm still not familiar with the controls.

328
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,840
Let's play it again.

329
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,510
This movement is really smooth.

330
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,700
It feels like people filming a martial arts film.

331
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,660
It's still lacking. The martial arts combinations should be more natural.

332
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,340
Let's eat first.

333
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,180
I can't tell at all.

334
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,590
You eat first. I'm going to play it a little more.

335
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,090
<i>Miss, what would you like to buy? Come in to take a look.</i>

336
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,820
<i>Our newly arrived flower hairpins are very beautiful.</i>

337
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,100
Why is the shopkeeper's expression so fawning?

338
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,220
I think he looks a little like Senior Yugong.

339
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,330
He's the model.

340
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,590
<i>Forget it if you're not buying anything. Don't stay here and block my business.</i>

341
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,150
This NPC is really intelligent.

342
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,050
Eat first.

343
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,760
This NPC's AI is really high. How did you do it?

344
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,880
It's an advanced behavior tree. Very complex.

345
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,860
It's one of our advantages.

346
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,520
I think this game

347
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,660
is different from all the games I've played before.

348
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,990
It's especially ... especially lively.

349
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,970
Every NPC seems to be alive.

350
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,420
In the game just now,

351
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,810
it felt as if I was really in a new world.

352
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,630
Moreover, the fight scenes were especially enjoyable.

353
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,360
I just tried the aerial skills.

354
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,760
There were so many movements, and their connections are so fluid.

355
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,360
The actions were especially cool. You could practically use this to directly shoot films.

356
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,830
This is a pretty small demo, mainly to display the battle system.

357
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,130
In the future, there will also be a separate lifestyle system added.

358
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,320
- You said that in the new game, there will be an independent lifestyle system?
- Yup.

359
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,280
It has a completely independent play style from the battle mode.

360
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,850
What do you mean by independent?

361
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,080
Could it be that you're saying, the players in the game don't have to fight in dungeons and

362
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,940
they could just farm or open a shop?

363
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,480
Players of lifestyle games make up a large portion of the market.

364
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,460
Most online games of the earlier days tend to use the lifestyle system as a supplemental tool.

365
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,640
This means they give up on these players up front.

366
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,620
Our online game will, to the largest extent, mimic the real world,

367
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,830
not only in fighting but also with a normal life.

368
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,820
Of course, if the players want to play in both modes, they can.

369
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,540
What you said makes me want to play it.

370
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,760
The world map of the online game is so large and it will definitely be fun.

371
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,960
In the past, I also played farm-type games,

372
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,030
but the map was so small and I lost interest in a few days.

373
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,760
But the game now,

374
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,450
you can either choose battle and leveling up as your main focus, and the lifestyle mode as a secondary,

375
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,060
or you can choose to develop the lifestyle as the key goal, adding in a little bit of battle.

376
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,930
Combining the two modes together, while functioning independently, is rare.

377
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,330
It's mostly due to the game engine.

378
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,730
We wrote the game engine ourselves, so we can get past these restrictions.

379
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,920
This is why I wanted to start my own business.

380
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,420
Only in this way can I achieve my vision of the game design.

381
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,040
And I can create my ideal game world.

382
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,070
Why are you zoning out? Get in the car.

383
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,100
Also, in the future, before the alpha test of the game,

384
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,890
the mobile version of the lifestyle system will first go on the market.

385
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,060
Mobile version of the lifestyle system?

386
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,140
When it's time for the beta test of the online game,

387
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,290
on the mobile game version, we'll announce 3D storyline videos of the online game

388
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,220
and announce that a little while after the online game is released,

389
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,370
- the mobile game and the online game can link their separate worlds.
- Oh,

390
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,900
I understand.

391
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,570
If I was a player of the mobile game, I would definitely go to have a look at the online game.

392
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,620
You really are too cunning.

393
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,970
Seriously. You want to capture the interest of all kinds of players in one fell swoop.

394
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,740
Erxi? Why is your arm hurt?

395
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,550
Are you hurt?

396
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,170
Why are you so industrious? You're injured, but still come to work.

397
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,180
Hey, I have a really effective medicinal wine at home. How about if I bring it to you tomorrow?

398
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,380
Thank you, but the medicinal wine isn't necessary. I just got bit by a cat.

399
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,240
You got bit by a small animal?

400
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,730
Then you definitely have to go to the hospital; otherwise, you might get rabies!

401
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,290
It's really dangerous.

402
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,890
What kind of cat is it? It's not a wild cat, right?

403
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,480
Recently, in our neighborhood, there are a lot of wild cats.

404
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Erxi, you really have to be careful from now on, and stay far away from them.

405
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,600
Right, I have a veterinary hospital next to my home.

406
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,310
I know a doctor there. He can give you a discount.

407
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,990
No need! Thank you!

408
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,750
I already got a shot. I have something to take care of so I'll leave first.

409
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,550
See you tomorrow!

410
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,140
Yiran, have a look. That one is Zhao Erxi.

411
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,920
Is she Bei Weiwei's roommate?

412
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,800
It's really true that birds of the same feather flock together.

413
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,950
This Zhao Erxi always shows off in the office,

414
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,190
claiming to be Brother Shao Xiang's girlfriend.

415
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,280
She doesn't even consider why Brother Shao Xiang would ever fall for her.

416
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,560
It's not impossible. Cousin has been quite a playboy.

417
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,520
I don't care. I have to teach her a lesson so that she will learn her place.

418
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,800
That's enough, Na Na. I brought you here for work,

419
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,520
not for you to deal with this.

420
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,520
If you're going to be like this, just leave.

421
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,030
Yiran.

422
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,430
Listen, okay? In the future, don't bully others using my name.

423
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,990
Yiran, are you afraid Zhao Erxi will tell Bei Weiwei

424
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,030
and she'll tell Xiao Nai?

425
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,690
Didn't I already tell you? I've given up on Xiao Nai.

426
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,420
Don't bring him up anymore.

427
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,530
Okay, I know.

428
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,630
Then, let's eat together tonight.

429
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,320
No, eat by yourself.

430
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,950
Yiran! Then what's the point of this whole thing?

431
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,330
It's only helping Bei Weiwei.

432
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,190
This way, please.

433
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,760
Please take a seat.

434
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,480
May I ask what you'd like to order?

435
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,330
My friend is coming. We will order in a bit.

436
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,970
All right.

437
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,970
<i>Miss Meng, your uncle, CEO Zhen of Zhen Yi Technologies, is looking for you.</i>

438
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,680
I had to make so many mistakes

439
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,710
to find out that I am really dumb.

440
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,860
In his eyes, I'm probably the same as a clown.

441
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,070
Sir, please come this way.

442
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,050
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

443
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,310
My beloved little cousin, why did you ask me to a meal?

444
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,860
Why isn't your little follower here?

445
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,740
What's wrong? Cousins can't have a meal together?

446
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,860
I'm treating today. Order anything you want.

447
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,170
What's wrong? Are you upset?

448
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,770
Nothing.

449
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,910
It's just that I thought of how dumb I used to be.

450
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,690
Also, he only wanted to kindly remind me,

451
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,910
or help me a bit. I had thought that meant he liked me.

452
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,390
It's such a joke.

453
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,780
What's wrong? Is it because of Xiao Nai?

454
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,470
Because of him, my dad has been having a rough time lately.

455
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,610
I heard that his company is competing with us over the development rights of "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

456
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,420
I really didn't see it, but he really does have some talent.

457
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,560
I wanted to help him before. I was really stupid.

458
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,580
No wonder he didn't like me.

459
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,280
Brother, let me tell you. He really is a good person.

460
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,440
Before, I might have only liked his looks

461
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,030
and aura, but now...

462
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,880
I like him as a person even more.

463
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,540
You're really dumb. Then you should fight for him.

464
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,350
I can't. He's really good to his girlfriend now.

465
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,050
I think I shouldn't be bothering them.

466
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,840
You are such a softy.

467
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,710
Men and women are really different. If it were me,

468
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:05,430
if I liked someone, I would snatch them away with everything I could think of.

469
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,750
Don't you have a girlfriend? And you're still talking like this.

470
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,240
Also, there are a lot of rumors in the company. You should be more mindful.

471
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,220
Okay, okay. Don't talk like your uncle.

472
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,070
I'll treat today. Cheer up.

473
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,650
Waiter!

474
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,490
Hello, dear owner, Zhao Erxi.

475
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,120
This is the luxury gift set of nuts from Three Squirrels that you ordered.

476
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,450
Zhao Erxi? She doesn't live here.

477
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,750
<i>Coming! Coming!</i>

478
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,610
I didn't think you would still come here. I thought you would be scared off because of the bite.

479
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,410
Move.

480
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,350
You bought so many things for me because you knew I was leaving.

481
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,580
- You're too kind.
- Hey!

482
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,050
It's not for you. It's because I found them too heavy,

483
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,140
so I wrote your address.

484
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,570
These are all kinds of cat food. Yum, yum.

485
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,160
I keep salivating.

486
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,770
If I didn't buy some nuts to nibble on,

487
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,330
the day would come when I eat Coffee's cat food.

488
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,550
But this is the first time

489
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,290
and the last time.

490
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,390
Here, I'm paying back your money.

491
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,260
- Is it Bei Weiwei's?
- Don't worry about whose it is.

492
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,160
Anyway, from now on,

493
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,150
I'm free!

494
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,550
I say, can you grow some backbone? You're taking your roommate's money to pay me back.

495
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,140
Do you feel proud?

496
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,680
It's better than owing you.

497
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,730
- Then is this the last time you're coming?
- No, no, no.

498
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,890
It's the last time, but not the last time, either.

499
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,840
It appears that you guessed the beginning, but not the ending.

500
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,280
Explain clearly!

501
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,900
Basically, it's the last time I come here as someone in debt.

502
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,100
As for you, just leave and feel reassured. I'll take care of Coffee.

503
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,530
Also, it will be for free.

504
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,650
I never thought that you, Zhao Erxi, are actually–

505
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,410
Don't feel so touched.

506
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,930
I didn't make this decision because of you. It's because of Coffee.

507
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:22,400
Think about it. How pitiful is it to leave a little cat all by itself?

508
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,850
Also, I really value the spirit of the contract.

509
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,640
Since the agreement was made, I have to see it through.

510
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,280
Coffee!

511
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,850
Coffee!

512
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,010
Did you miss me?

513
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,890
Sister will give you some yum yums.

514
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,990
Coffee! Coffee...

515
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,040
You bit me, and now want to kiss up to me?

516
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,160
Are you apologizing?

517
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,790
Okay, I'll forgive you.

518
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,430
I feel that we can still add some things to the family system,

519
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,010
especially about interactions between different families.

520
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:46,250
What do you think of this music?

521
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,890
Mr. Xiao, were you listening to me?

522
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,790
Mm. Once you've thought it through, write a report.

523
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,110
My lady, why did you bite me? Now I have to return the favor.

524
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,660
Is this really your first time dating?

525
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,420
Yes.

526
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,090
You're too seasoned.

527
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,790
Once I see you, I learned it on my own.

528
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,780
Are you still going in the afternoon?

529
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,220
No.

530
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,480
Interns don't get paid. I'm going to rest on the weekend.

531
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,250
Then take care of the house. Don't go to Xiao Ling's.

532
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,780
<i> He wants me to watch the house? This isn't my house. </i>

533
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,680
