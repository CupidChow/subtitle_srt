<i>♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫</i>

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,600
<i>♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫</i>

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
<i>♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫</i>

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
<i>♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫</i>

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫</i>

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,600
<i>♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫</i>

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,600
<i>♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫</i>

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫</i>

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
<i>♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫</i>

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>♫ Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up ♫</i>

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫</i>

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
<i>♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫</i>

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,700
<i>♫ So this is what love looks like ♫</i>

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫</i>

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
<i>♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫</i>

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫</i>

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,300
<i>♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫</i>

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫</i>

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,300
<i>♫ I want to travel to all four corners [of the earth] with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫</i>

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,400
<i>♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫</i>

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫</i>

<i>[Episode 6]</i>

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,700
Why are there so many servers?

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,600
Did the sun rise in the west? Are you starting to play online games?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
I need to try them one at a time.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
It's very tiring to locate the server.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,400
Here, have a bottle of Eastbroc Super Drink.
<i>(Energy drink as Red Bull)</i>

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Thanks.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,700
Could Bei Weiwei be playing this game, too?

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,800
And you don't know which server is hers.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,800
That's right, but I know her ID.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,700
Buddy, you are too much. Take your time to find it by yourself.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,900
Just which server could it be?

37
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,800
<i>We agreed to upload the video at this time.</i>

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,400
It's up.

<i>[Lady Bandit's Abduction of Her Lover]</i>

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
<i>Oh no, they are mountain bandits.</i>

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
<i>Bandit, what are you trying to do?</i>

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
<i>I cleared this path. I planted this tree.</i>

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,900
<i>If you wish to pass, leave the man behind!</i>

44
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,800
<i>I can't do that.</i>

45
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,500
You dislike me so much...

46
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,300
You are free to leave. I am letting you go.

47
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>[Double Happiness]</i>

48
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,100
<i>You have a promising future. Why did you waste your life in the wildness of this mountain?</i>

49
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
<i>How could this be?</i>

50
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>When I recorded this, the ending was that after the female bandit died,</i>

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,400
<i>the zither musician carried her body and jumped off the Dusk Glow Peak.</i>

52
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,300
<i>Master edited it to be so melodramatic.</i>

53
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,200
<i>If it gets out that I cried upon watching this,</i>

54
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
<i>wouldn't it be so embarrassing?</i>

55
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,000
<i>I finished watching it. It was very good.</i>

56
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,520
<i>Did you change the ending?</i>

57
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,800
<i>Yes, I did. Or else, the duration would not be long enough.</i>

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,500
<i>Duration? What duration?</i>

59
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,600
<i>I remember that there is no limit on the duration for the competition.</i>

60
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,100
<i>It's stated in the competition rule book that if the duration of the video is longer than half an hour,</i>

61
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
<i>the reward including the experience points will be doubled for the winner.</i>

62
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,000
<i>Since we have done this, we should take everything we can.</i>

63
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,900
<i>He's indeed the Master. He even combed through these kinds of details.</i>

64
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,000
<i>However, are you so certain that we will win?</i>

65
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,600
<i>No, it's not right. This is not the key point.</i>

66
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,000
<i>The key point is that, based on the Master's statement,</i>

67
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,700
<i>the ending that almost made me cry</i>

68
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,100
<i>was only added by him to reach the time threshold.</i>

69
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>Then... how did you come up with this ending?</i>

70
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>It's much better than the original.</i>

71
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
<i>The original ending was fine.</i>

72
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>It's just not easy to slot in segments of flashbacks.</i>

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
<i>It would be too obvious.</i>

74
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,900
<i>Then about the ending now,</i>

75
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,700
<i>was just to make it easier to lengthen the video to reach the time threshold?</i>

76
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,800
<i>More or less.</i>

77
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,100
<i>So, not only did the Master fill in the time,</i>

78
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,600
<i>he also slotted many flashbacks for the edit.</i>

79
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,000
<i>The ending originated from stalling the time and taking the easy way out.</i>

80
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,500
<i>About the emotional impact? Or about death to keep us apart?</i>

81
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
<i>They're just like the fleeting clouds in the sky.
<i>(Note: not what he cared about)</i></i>

82
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,800
<i>I was too naive for being so moved by it before.</i>

83
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,400
<i>Let's post this in the forum then. Should you do it, or I?</i>

84
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,700
<i>You do it. I'm too lazy to register.</i>

85
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,030
<i>Fine, I will do it now.</i>

86
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
<i>I just posted it and there are so many comments already.</i>

87
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
<i>Did you read them? Many cried after watching it.</i>

88
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,000
<i>The beginning and the ending are so tragic. They all say that the writer is really awful.</i>

89
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,500
<i>I became your scapegoat. The video listed me as the writer.</i>

90
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
<i>I didn't read them. Tell me when the results are out.</i>

91
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,700
<i>Okay. After I read them, I will brief you everyday.</i>

92
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,720
<i>Why must the zither musician kill the female bandit?</i>

93
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,700
<i>I'm very sure you came up with that plot.</i>

94
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
<i>But I only did it as a twist for effect.</i>

95
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,400
<i>If he were you, would you kill the female bandit?</i>

96
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,210
<i>He wasn't me.</i>

97
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>Huh?</i>

98
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,800
<i>He's not me. I wouldn't go to that extreme.</i>

99
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>I'm leaving. There's no one in the library now.</i>

100
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,400
<i>There's probably still someone around.</i>

101
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,400
<i>It's true. How did you know?</i>

102
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,400
<i>It was just a guess. Be careful on your way home.</i>

103
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
<i>♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫</i>

104
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,300
<i>♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫</i>

105
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,800
<i>♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫</i>

106
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,400
<i>♫ Came at just the right time ♫</i>

107
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
I finished reading this. Bye.
<i>♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫</i>

108
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,600
Bye.
<i>♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫</i>

109

<i>♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, I’m willing to ♫</i>

<i>♫ Chase away all the troubles ♫</i>

111

<i>♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫</i>

112
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
<i>♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫</i>

113
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,400
<i>♫ I want to give you a hug ♫</i>

<i>♫ You are so important to me ♫</i>

115
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Why are you still in Clan Pu Village?

116
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
Didn't I help upgrade you to level 30?

117
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Because I have the highest level at Clan Pu village,

118
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't bear to leave.

119
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,400
It's so dangerous out there.

120
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,800
Look at this place. I rule supreme among this green mountain and emerald water.

121
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Looking around, everyone is a clumsy newbie here.

122
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,500
I want to enjoy the feeling of superiority in skill and reputation a while longer.

123
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,000
Such an ace like you wouldn't understand how such a fake ace like me would feel.

124
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Scared me to death.

125
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Enough, enough. Go back to your things.

126
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,500
I just discovered the joy of this game, and don't need your help for the time being.

127
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm going to wash my face.

128
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,000
<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

129
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,400
Weiwei! Save me!

130
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,400
Weiwei, help me.

131
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
What's wrong?

132
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,200
This is not urgent. I'm about to die!

133
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,400
How could there be such a crisis in Clan Pu Village?

134
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,800
Your level is so high. Who would dare to challenge you?

135
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
It wasn't me. I saw someone being bullied and I drew out my sword to help,

136
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,800
but I encountered a minion monster of particularly high agility.

137
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
I can't move fast enough to keep up with him.

138
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,900
Let's go!

139
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,620
Please sit, my Heroine Weiwei.

140
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Drink this and teach them a lesson.

141
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay.

142
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
It's done. You can continue.

143
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,100
I won't express my gratitude so casually for this big favor.

144
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,900
- Serve me milk tomorrow.
- No problem.

145
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,020
Heroine, please wait up.

146
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,240
Thank you for saving me, Heroine.

147
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
As we wander in this world, the higher our ability; the more is our responsibility.

148
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,800
This is what I should do. See you again.

149
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
Wait.

150
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Are you calling me?

151
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Well... this is my first game.

152
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,000
You also saw it. I am really helpless when I run into these low-level monsters.

153
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
You are so amazing. Would you take me under your wing?

154
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,800
<i>This idiot just praised me for being amazing.</i>

155
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,200
<i>If he follows me around, it will be pretty good if he offers me praises.</i>

156
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,400
<i>It's rare to find someone even more pitiful than myself.</i>

157
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:39,070
Okay, then. I will take you until you can defeat the monsters on your own.

158
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Master, please accept me as your disciple.

159
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
<i>Did I say that I would take in a disciple?</i>

160
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,600
<i>I haven't even left Clan Pu Village and already got a disciple.</i>

161
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,500
<i>I gained something.</i>

162
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay, then. Disciple, please rise.

163
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,000
As I used the technique of Wing Flapping Roc,

164
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I took out that minion monster in no time.

165
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,900
My disciple knelt down and said

166
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,500
"Master, take me in as your disciple!"

167
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,200
I didn't imagine that within such a short time in the game,

168
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,800
I could spread my influence and reputation.

169
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,500
I am awesome, aren't I?

170
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,900
I only feel like having a mental breakdown now!

171
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,000
Si Si.

172
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,200
I am awesome, aren't I?

173
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Bang!

174
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,800
You are too ruthless.

175
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,600
Are you done swiping my phone?

176
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,700
Looking at the cellphone while walking is bad for your eyes.

177
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,300
Also, when are you getting a new cellphone?

178
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,000
I will get one after my summer job. I don't have enough money right now.

179
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,100
What are you swiping?

180
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,100
A friend and I created a video.

181
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,600
We are gathering votes in the forum now.

182
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,000
Look. We are ahead by a lot now.

183
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,500
We will definitely get the first place. Here.

184
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,200
Let's go.

185
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,840
<i>Weiwei, where are you? I need to find you about something.</i>

186
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,800
<i>The usual. Escorting a wagon of goods. What's up?</i>

187
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,400
<i>Then, I'll see you at Hangzhou Security Escort Agency where you've completed the task.</i>

188
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
<i>Ni Ni, what's the matter?</i>

189
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,600
<i>Weiwei, I have a question to ask you.</i>

190
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>What is it?</i>

191
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
<i>If someone were to give you a big sum of money,</i>

192
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,500
<i>would you be willing to withdraw from the video competition?</i>

193
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,760
<i>Zhenshui Wuxiang?</i>

194
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,500
<i>Weiwei, you guessed right.</i>

195
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,200
<i>There's no need to guess. Isn't it very obvious?</i>

196
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,800
<i>If I withdraw from the competition, who will benefit directly from this?</i>

197
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,400
<i>The winner will get the Rainbow garment.</i>

198
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,000
<i>Xiaoyu Yaoyao seems to like that garment very much.</i>

199
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
<i>That's why Zhenshui Wuxiang requested that I ask you without telling her.</i>

200
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
<i>Because of the last battle, he felt awkward to ask you directly.</i>

201
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
<i>Weiwei, you didn't get mad, did you?</i>

202
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
<i>I didn't. I just find it laughable.</i>

203
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,800
<i>If he plans to spend hundreds of thousands to ask me to withdraw,</i>

204
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
<i>advise him not to make a fool of himself.</i>

205
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
<i>Hundreds of thousands? </i>

206
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
<i>How could Zhenshui possibly spend that much money?</i>

207
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
<i>From his tone, the most will be a few thousands. At the highest, it may be some tens of thousands.</i>

208
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
<i>Weiwei, are you really that rich?</i>

209
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
<i>I really couldn't tell.</i>

210
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,100
<i>I kept a low profile.</i>

211
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,400
<i>Forget it, then.</i>

212
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,200
<i>Weiwei, you are not angry, right?</i>

213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
<i>Frankly, I didn't want to help him ask.</i>

214
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>But I think he really loves Enchantress Xiao Yu,</i>

215
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
<i>so it made me soft on this.</i>

216
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,500
<i>Do you know that they've met and become a couple in real life?</i>

217
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,000
<i>They live in the capital city. Weiwei, you live there as well, right?</i>

218
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,200
<i>That's right. The server is called Stormy Capital.</i>

219
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
<i>There are many players from here.</i>

220
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,000
<i>Speaking of which... Master, Yugong and the rest should be studying here as well, right?</i>

221
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,500
<i>I'm in Tianjin. Otherwise, I would come to look you guys up for fun.</i>

222
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,000
<i>By the way, Zhenshui is really very handsome.</i>

223
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
<i>I have the photo of them together. Weiwei, do you want to take a look?</i>

224
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,100
<i>Not interested.</i>

225
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,600
<i>By the way, Weiwei. Haven't you met Yixiao Naihe?</i>

226
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,900
<i>Is he handsome or not?</i>

227
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>I haven't.</i>

228
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
<i>Okay, I'm not chatting with you anymore.</i>

229
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,500
<i>I have an appointment at 5:00 p.m. to kill some boss monsters.</i>

230
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,730
You, Yugong and the others all live in the capital city, right?

231
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,260
Yes.

232
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,370
I'm going to fight some monsters.

233
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,850
I say you're too shameless,

234
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,930
hiding behind Sister-in-Law, leeching experience.

235
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,310
After leeching off my wife so much,

236
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,560
I slowly got used to it.

237
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,680
You guys who don't have a wife to protect them... won't understand.

238
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,410
Attack him!

239
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,830
Sister-in-Law, we'll forget about you not appreciating our kindness, but you even step on us.

240
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,510
I'll die with a grudge!

241
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,700
Naturally, the couple is of the same mindset.

242
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,120
We shouldn't interfere with family affairs.

243
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,510
I didn't see you guys there.

244
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,680
Why were you all lying on the ground?

245
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,980
So pretentious! I don't believe you didn't see how Third Brother was just mistreating us.

246
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,100
This is called... selective blindness.

247
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,520
As expected, it's tough to serve as the lady boss of the homeowner association.

248
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,530
The result of the video contest has been announced.

249
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,090
<i>The winners of the video contest are now revealed.</i>

250
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,140
The submitted video by Luwei Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe for the contest,

251
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,940
<i>"Lady Bandit's Abduction of Her Lover" proudly took the crown.</i>

252
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,210
Naihe, we really won.

253
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,940
I saw it.

254
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,230
The reputation is justified by the work. Post-production seems to be done by Yixiao Naihe.

255
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,850
<i>All aspects are so perfect. Isn't this too amazing?</i>

256
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,590
This way of distributing the awards is too amazing, isn't it?

257
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,150
Exactly. Are they not concerned about crushing Naihe to death?

258
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,930
Wow! Sister-in-Law, Hurry and put it on. Try it out.

259
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,970
And you should try it on as well.

260
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,810
Change the color and have a look. It has seven colors.

261
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,050
That's right. Quickly, try it.

262
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,400
Only has six colors?

263
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,740
It seems to be missing one color, isn't it?

264
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,870
Green. The green one!

265
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,560
<i>Green? Master's constant head ornament has been a white head-wrap.</i>

266
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
<i>The head ornament of the Seven-Colored Garment turns out to be green.</i>

267
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,020
<i>Did they design it like this on purpose?</i>

268
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,100
This Third Brother has an issue.

269
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,070
He doesn't dare to wear the same couple's outfit as Third Sister-in-Law.

270
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,580
Could it be...

271
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,500
We've already been a couple for a while.

272
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,170
We don't care about these superficial gestures.

273
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,050
You guys chat. I'm going to take a stroll.

274
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,170
<i>We've already been a couple for a while.</i>

275
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,710
<i>We don't care about these superficial gestures.</i>

276
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,070
<i>There is gossip but you can't talk about it.</i>

277
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,660
<i>Luwei Weiwei, you're not fun at all.</i>

278
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,760
<i>It seems... huh?</i>

279
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,860
<i>Haven't you met Yixiao Naihe? Is he handsome, or not?</i>

280
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,820
<i>If Master says we should exchange photos,</i>

281
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,930
<i>would I be willing?</i>

282
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,930
<i>It seems... I'd be willing.</i>

283
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,270
<i>But what if he says we should meet up?</i>

284
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,940
<i>It seems... I'd also be willing to meet.</i>

285
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,410
<i>According to Master's personality,</i>

286
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,920
<i>he wouldn't bring up such a request, so never mind a meeting.</i>

287
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,570
<i>However, if we don't meet,</i>

288
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,330
<i>in the future when I stop playing online games, will we simply forget about each other?</i>

What are you doing, Sister Mei? I could hear your sentimental singing from a distance away.

296
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,750
What smell is this?

297
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,530
My god, what is that? A poison gas bomb?

298
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,430
It's stinging my eyes. I can't even open my eyes anymore.

299
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,020
If you can act so well, why didn't you go to Beijing Film Academy?

300
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,960
There are a lot of girls there as well.

301
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,420
I'm telling you, the next time you call me by that nickname, I'll send over a pair of Yu Banshan's socks.

302
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,840
No need, no need. I still want to live for a few more days.

303
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,390
What's got into you? Why are you washing your socks?

304
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,820
Don't you know? Third Brother...

305
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,160
He's coming back here...

306
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,550
♪ <i>Big Chinese cabbage</i> ♪

307
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,920

309

310
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,540
Xiao Nai, how did you manage to do this?

311
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,130
It has nothing to do with me.

312
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,650
They just put special attention on hygiene and decided to tidy up a bit.

313
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,810
I suddenly feel that I should clean up a bit. I'm leaving.

314
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,910
Sister Mei, lend me your laundry detergent. I haven't used that stuff in 800 years.

315
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,280
- I'm leaving.
- Do you need rags?

316
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,540
No need. Thank you!

317
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,350
As I see it, our dorm room has reached the standard of a five-star hotel.

318
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,950
We will no longer be afraid when girls come over.

319
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,780
Third Brother, you'll regret this.

320
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,550
Before, you could count on Yu Banshan's socks to keep away the girls.

321
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,220
Now, they've become so pure. Giving off this tempting aroma,

322
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,870
the girls will no longer be afraid. They'll fill up our entire dorm soon.

323
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,610
- Hang them up.
- Okay.

324
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Old Yu! Why didn't we learn our lesson?

325
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,370
Why did we decide to play the game with Third Brother?

326
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,440
That year,

327
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,930
we first came to Tsinghua University.

328
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,420
Young and ignorant.

329
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,660
<i>I haven't asked you yet. How old are you guys?</i>

330
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,360
<i>As for me, I started elementary school a year late. I'm 20 years old. I should be the oldest.</i>

331
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,150
<i>- I'm nineteen.
- I'm also nineteen.</i>

332
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,320
<i>You're also nineteen? Then I'm definitely older than you. I was born in January.</i>

333
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,370
<i>Okay. I put equal weight on beauty and love, a Libra.</i>

334
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,810
<i>Then it appears that you're the youngest.</i>

335
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,800
<i>I'm the oldest, so I'll set the order.</i>

336
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,040
<i>I'm Big Brother, you're Second Brother, you're Third Brother,</i>

337
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,000
<i>and you're Fourth Brother. Fourth Brother! Forget it.</i>

338
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,770
<i>Fourth Brother doesn't sound right. We'll call you Little Brother, then.
(Note: Four sounds similar to death.)</i>

339
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,250
<i>I feel there's no sense in going by age.</i>

340
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,530
<i>We're men.</i>

341
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,760
<i>We should let our ability do the talking.</i>

342
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,520
<i>You've lost again.</i>

343
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,020
<i>Okay. Little Brother, you've become the Big Brother now.</i>

344
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,250
<i>No need to concede so much. I'm fine being Third Brother.</i>

345
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,430
<i>Are you that generous?</i>

346
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,180
<i>Big Brother is the default leader. You'll need to do things.</i>

347
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,660
We were still too young. Why did we compete with him on ability?

348
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,130
He uses provocation every time. Impulsiveness is an original sin!

349
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,940
- Original sin!
- Original sin!

350
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,600
Hang on! I have a phone call.

351
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,930
Unknown phone call.

352
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,330
Yes, hello?

353
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,590
<i>Hello. May I ask if this is Mr. Yu Banshan?</i>

354
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,150
Yes. Who might you be?

355
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,990
<i>May I ask if it's convenient to speak right now?</i>

356
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,240
A girl!

357
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,950
Quick, quick.

358
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,980
Hello, Miss. It's convenient.

359
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,610
Who might you be?

360
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,720
<i> It's like this. I'm Director Li's secretary, Xiao Li, from the Game Development Department at Zhen Yi Technology.</i>

361
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,950
<i>You came to our company before. Do you still remember?</i>

362
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,970
I remember.

363
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,510
<i>Last time, after meeting, our Director Li constantly talked about you.</i>

364
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,980
<i>He has high regard for you in particular and wants to know if you are free in the next few days.</i>

365
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,550
<i>Director Li would like to arrange a meal with you alone.</i>

366
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,610
Alone?

367
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,700
I'll call you back in a bit, okay? I'm a little busy.

368
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
Goodbye.

369
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,550
- Who was it?
- Houzi, help me charge my phone.

370
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,150
Third Brother, you still remember Director Li from Zhen Yi, right?

371
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,500
Did he ask to see you?

372
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,860
Darn! Are you a demon?

373
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,680
Did he only ask you alone?

374
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,900
That's right. His secretary just called me

375
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,000
and insisted on seeing me alone. He didn't want me to tell you.

376
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,340
Her voice

377
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,980
almost melted me.

378
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,250
She's even buttering me up. What's going on?

379
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,040
Old Yu, they are using the ploy to buy you off with a woman.

380
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,590
Idiot.

381
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,240
Am I the type who can be bought off with a woman?

382
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,660
It would at least take several.

383
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,380
- Damn, you beast!
- Stop it!

384
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,940
What are they trying to do?

385
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,660
Are they trying to poach?

386
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,130
Their company has a history of doing this.

387
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,240
The year before they released a mobile card game. Do you remember?

388
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,860
I do. The monthly sales were over $100 million. It was a legend in the industry.

389
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,360
That's right.

390
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,540
That game was developed by a small company.

391
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,680
Zhen Yi Technology failed to acquire that company and poached its entire team.

392
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,240
They created a similar game and launched it in advance.

393
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,160
They may be trying the same trick again.

394
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,560
Poached the entire team?

395
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,300
Wouldn't that small company be doomed?

396
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,530
Darn. This is so ruthless.

397
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,960
Third Brother, if they try to seduce me, you must protect me.

398
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,220
Don't go if you are afraid.

399
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,430
I'm telling you. We must remember the trust in our brotherhood.

400
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:25,540
We must not be seduced by things like money, women, houses or cars.

401
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,720
Am I right? When push comes to shove,

402
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,250
I will go.

403
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,850
Forget you!

404
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,500
I... I will go. I'm the ace in programming.

405
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,410
Banshan, if you recommend that I go,

406
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,060
I will give you thirty percent.

407
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,310
By the way, Banshan, did you leave your phone number with them?

408
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,930
I didn't.

409
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:51,540
That's right. I didn't leave my number with them. Where did they get it from?

410
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,870
They went through great troubles to find your phone number.

411
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,590
It seems this is not a simple matter. They came prepared.

412
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,040
Third Brother, I didn't turn them down on the spot.

413
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,630
If they want to poach me, I will reject them directly.

414
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,540
Why would you reject it? Isn't this a good opportunity?

415
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,120
Wh−What good opportunity is this?

416
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,310
Whenever Third Brother puts on that mysterious smile, it means that someone will definitely get it on the chin.

417
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,960
This is so cold and scary.

418
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,680
I'm scared, too. How are you going to handle this?

419
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Have meals first.

420
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,490
I'll listen to you. Wait for me. My phone has only been charging for two minutes.

421
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,670
Big Brother, five minutes of charging can go up to two hours for your phone.

422
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,950
There won't be any problems. Go to eat first.

423
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,460
Wait. I need to change my clothes.

424
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,530
It's just a meal. Why do you need to change?

425
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,160
You don't know crap.

426
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,420
Wherever Third Brother goes, girls swarm around. I have to present myself in the best possible light to greet their inspection.

427
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,920
- I'm going to change, too.
- Me, too.

428
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,770
Let's go now.

429
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,020
The feeling of having Third Brother back here is really great.

430
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,030
- He's the focus.
- All of a sudden, I find myself particularly cool.

431
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,780
We need to look cool.

432
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,300
<i>Wow! So good looking!</i>

433
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,930
<i>Let's go to see him now.</i>

434
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,410
Where's Third Brother?

435
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,230
Did he abandon us to get in line first?

436
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,830
Master? He's actually here in the cafeteria!

437
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,500
Did you see him?

438
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,520
I got to queue up in the same line with Master in my lifetime.

439
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,040
My luck is just unbelievable here!

440
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,030
You are in the line next to him.

441
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,670
I have decided.

442
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,780
What did you decide?

443
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,300
Let's eat whatever he orders for lunch.

444
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,090
What a great decision!

445
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,310
But it's not easy to realize this decision.

446
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,440
He's behind us. We will definitely be faster than him.

447
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,720
We might as well pray that he will sit at the same table with us.

448
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,990
Don't even dream about this.

449
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,670
And also, it will burn off too much of our luck.

450
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,580
I am worried that we don't have the constitution to withstand the burden.

451
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,340
Next.

452
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,540
What do you want to eat?

453
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,160
<i>These three.</i>

454
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,930
His line is moving very fast. Your wish will come true soon.

455
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,460
The woman (<i>who's working behind the counter</i>) is so slow in getting rice. I am so moved that I want to cry.

456
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,630
What do you want?

457
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,570
- Sweet and sour pork ribs.
- Sweet and sour pork ribs.

458
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,650
There's only one serving left. Both of you...

459
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,180
No need. I will have an order of the salted chicken.

460
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,460
I don't want this, either. This is fine.

461
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,140
I want the sweet and sour pork ribs. Give me all then.

462
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,680
Thank you, buddy.

463
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,740
Hey, I bought more food.

464
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,900
Brothers, why did they have a guy serving the food today?

465
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,840
But it's good to have this guy. Look.

466
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,170
My serving is especially big. As for this dish of stir-fried three kinds,

467
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,790
there is a higher amount of meat in particular.

468
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm bewildered. Why isn't there any meat in mine?

469
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,830
Not even a single piece.

470
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,640
That's right. I don't have any either.

471
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,270
What do you know? This is called a personal attribute.

472
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,630
You are not at my level.

473
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,620
He must have thought that you have a baby face.

474
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,610
And also, you appear to be under-developed. That's why he gave you more.

475
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,890
Who are you calling under-developed? If you dare, we can have a go after we return later.

476
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,110
Stop it. Your conversation is so "decent" that I can't bear to listen anymore.

477
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,430
Talking about this, we have never been here.

478
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,140
It's quite a distance away from our dormitory.

479
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,720
Third Brother, what's going on? Why are we eating here today?

480
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,350
I just thought of it.

481
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,330
I think the food here is great. In any case, I love this dining hall.

482
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,600
Let's eat here in the future.

483
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,000
<i>Why didn't you listen to me and sit closer to the Master?</i>

484
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,250
<i>We agreed to get the same food as his but didn't get it, either.</i>

485
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,070
Fortunately, I have the same drink as his.

486
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,590
Why do I keep feeling rather guilty?

487
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,560
Guilty about what?

488
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,490
<i>I keep feeling that since I lied to Cao Guang</i>

489
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,930
<i>about getting a boyfriend like the Master,</i>

490
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,840
<i>I keep running into him more and more.</i>

491
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,900
<i>One indeed shouldn't do any bad deeds. I feel so guilty.</i>

492
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,930
Hurry and tell me. What are you guilty about?

493
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,070
Just eat your food.

494
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,660
Let's study after this. Later, the couple PK contest begins registration tonight.

495
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,600
I need to rush back. Eat up.

496
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,020
I'm going to the restroom. You guys eat.

497
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,040
Eat.

498
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,140
Stop looking.

499
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,710
<i>It starts next Friday and lasts for a month.</i>

500
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,690
<i>If we get into the final,</i>

501
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,060
<i>after the competition, I still have a week to focus on reviewing my study of English.</i>

502
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,150
<i>There's no problem with my time. Is yours okay?</i>

503
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,080
<i>It's fine. Notify me one day in advance when we have a match.</i>

504
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,970
<i>Fine. I will be your activity calendar.</i>

505
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,440
Third Brother, the contest for the Couple's PK is starting soon.

506
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,430
This is a contest for all the servers. There will be a lot of highly skilled players. Let's train together. Practice with us first.

507
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,060
That's right. You can regard us as your opponents.

508
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,310
We can play a simulated PK match.

509
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,430
Our opponents are couples.

510
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,820
Which one will be the man and which will be the woman?

511
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,850
- Of course, I'm the man.
- Of course, I'm the man.

512
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,880
- I'm heavier than you.
- I'm taller than you.

513
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,990
I'm better looking than you.

514
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm more attractive than you.

515
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,740
You won't back down unless I beat you up, right?

516
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,280
- Who's going to get beat up?
- Huh?!

517
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,010
