<i> [Episode 22] </i>

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,900
After working hard day and night,

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,290
my Huantian Xidi's forging skills are finally at max level!

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,320
This is a cause worthy of celebration around the world.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,340
This really is too good! Finally, I don't have to listen to your whining or

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,700
help you level up.

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,950
That... That sword I made is still missing an ingredient.

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,760
I really can't beat... Hey! Weiwei! Weiwei!

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,250
Please consider the great trauma I suffered today...

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,140
Bring your laptop.

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,730
Weiwei, go ahead and get it.

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,360
Show me the ingredient! Show me the ingredient!

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,430
Weiwei, with your luck, it would be a shame not to buy a lottery ticket!

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,670
You got it on the first try!

40
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,970
Now you have all the materials you need. You should be fine now. Go to the blacksmith's shop and give it a try.

41
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,950
You're about to witness a history-making moment.

42
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,500
Watch me.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,330
- Weiwei.
- What is it?

44
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,570
I'm nervous.

45
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,680
I have to use the Amethyst Cleansing Vase next to reset the equipment attributes.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,950
We are betting on luck and personality now.

47
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,110
Weiwei, how about if you help me pick?

48
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,080
That's not right. You want to give a gift to your friend.

49
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,240
If I help you click on this crucial step,

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,440
it wouldn't be right.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,910
Look at my little finger, with its tiny scar.

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,150
What if I click on it and

53
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,290
cause a bloody disaster that results in ruining the sword and its owner...

54
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,790
Besides, you're obviously on a lucky streak tonight.

55
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,870
Such a rare ingredient and you got it right away.

56
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,110
This...

57
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,120
Then I'll pick now.

58
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,440
Erxi, Erxi! It really is a top-class sword!

59
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,900
Heavens! I really am lucky tonight!

60
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,220
Weiwei, what would I do without you?

61
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,210
Calm down. Calm down. Okay,

62
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,530
now you can engrave words on the sword

63
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,270
and leave your heartfelt wishes. Go ahead.

64
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,810
Weiwei, it's a little explicit...

65
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,550
- Could you...
- Okay, I understand. I can't see anything.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,280
Your Majesty Erxi, have you finished?

67
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,490
I'm admiring it for a minute.

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
- Hello?
- <i>Weiwei?</i>

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,880
<i>I'm Diemeng.</i>

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,710
- Oh, Diemeng.
- Yes.

71
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm asking if you are free tomorrow and perhaps we can have dinner together?

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,180
- Tomorrow?
<i> - Yeah. </i>

73
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,390
<i>Are you free tomorrow?</i>

74
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,110
I should be able to.

75
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,090
- That's great. In a minute, I'll text you the time and address.
- Okay.

76
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,780
<i>Then, see you tomorrow.</i>

77
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,830
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

78
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,650
- Someone's asking you out?
- A friend from the game.

79
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,010
Lately, haven't you been swimming for an hour with Master every day?

80
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,260
Now you're going out to dinner with someone else.

81
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,470
Would Master object to that?

82
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,080
Whether he objects or not isn't important at all.

83
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,650
Ha-ha...

84
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,010
Ha-ha, what? Your sword is already forged. Now you're burning the bridge behind you, aren't you?

85
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,890
Weiwei, is it because you just don't want to go swimming with Master?

86
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,570
So you agreed to go out to dinner with someone else so readily?

87
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,910
I can't handle the nose bleed every day like this...

88
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,220
- Smart people die young. Understand?
- I do.

89
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,400
Frankly, I need a break from the sumptuous meals.

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,590
- Bragging again?
- I was wrong.

91
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,620
I can't help it. I learned it from the people next to me.

92
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,920
You are still at it. Are you done yet?

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,120
No, no, no. <i>I learned from those next to me.</i>

94
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,390
Weiwei already made two online friends.

95
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,690
One of them is at the level of Master.

96
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,400
<i>I wonder what Wei Guang is like.</i>

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,660
Why did I think of that unlucky guy?

98
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,410
They are both "Guang,"

99
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,290
but Wei Guang is the "Great Sunshine."

100
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,630
As for that Cao Guang, he's at most a tiny two-watt light bulb.

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,460
Wei Guang, Wei Guang.

102
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,350
When will you be online?

103
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,380
<i>Reporting. Coffee has been eating and pooping normally.</i>

104
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,060
<i>Just a little lethargic and staring out of the window all the time.</i>

105
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,020
<i>She probably misses you.</i>

106
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,840
<i>[Erxi]</i>

107
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,500
<i>Special Bulletin. Coffee learned a new skill today: catching flies.</i>

108
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,530
<i>The owner doesn't have to worry about the little kitty getting bored anymore.</i>

109
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,590
<i>Hence, I opened all the windows at home to let the flies in.</i>

110
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,080
<i>The owner probably doesn't mind, right?</i>

111
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,120
<i>Coffee is very adorable.</i>

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,140
<i>But someone's big face next to her</i>

113
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,630
<i>is ruining the picture.</i>

114
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,060
<i>Coffee's silent line is that,</i>

115
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,170
<i>"If you don't show respect to Sister Erxi, then you are not showing me the respect."</i>

116
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,120
<i>I will dismiss you with my gas.</i>

117
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,170
<i>♫ You...want to be my love? ♫</i>

118
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,620
Let's sit over there.

119
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,060
Over there.

120
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,830
Hello, may I ask who will be ordering?

121
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,600
Senior Brother K.O., why don't you do it?

122
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,280
No need.

123
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,080
I'll do it.

124
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,440
Junior Sister Weiwei, I realized that you have never called me

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,780
Senior Brother Hao.

126
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,750
If I were to call you this,

127
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,430
Master would destroy me.

128
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,390
Why?

129
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,410
Senior Brother Hao. Senior Brother Hao.
<i>[Note: Hao means Good]</i>

130
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,120
Senior Brother Hao.

131
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,610
Senior Brother Hao.

132
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,430
Forget it.

133
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,780
If you call me that, he wouldn't destroy you but me instead.

134
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,680
How dangerous! I almost lost my life.

135
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,660
I will order. I need to console my innocent soul.

136
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,600
Did you realize this? After Third Brother got Third Sister-in-Law, he has become so spoiled.

137
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,620
When he didn't have time for lunch, he would have just a bun with water.

138
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,110
Look at him now. He has everything. So thoughtful of Weiwei.

139
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,380
He used to have only a bun and water before?

140
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,790
Not only that. Sometimes, not even the bun when he got busy.

141
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,470
Look at how distressed Junior Sister Weiwei looks.

142
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,040
That's right. I learned he's not picky about food at all.

143
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,580
He even told me to get fried rice for him. It's so lacking in nutrition.

144
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,050
In the future, leave Master's balanced diet to me.

145
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,360
It will be supplemented with some juice made with love. There will be food and drink as well.

146
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,980
A perfectly balanced diet. Okay, now!

147
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,070
Save me. They are blinding my eyes.

148
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,020
Thinking about this, I had a true online romance right before me,

149
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,400
but I didn't appreciate it back then.

150
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Thinking about this now, I'm filled with regret.

151
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,290
Senior Brother Hao, an online romance is not right.

152
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,420
What about your situation with Xiao Nai then?

153
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,790
We met online and learned of each other in person.

154
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,940
Subsequently... who are you with? Tell us.

155
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,170
Mine wasn't in "A Chinese Ghost Story."

156
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,420
Before I played "A Chinese Ghost Story," I played a game called

157
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,400
"Fantasy Planet."

158
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
I played the role of the Heavenly Physician.

159
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,950
I know this game,

160
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,500
but it seems that only females played the role of the Heavenly Physician.

161
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,480
- Did you play the female role?
- Yep.

162
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,850
At that time in the game, this was the only character that suited my taste.

163
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,660
Subsequently, many of my friends become couples.

164
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,570
I thought that I should find one, too.

165
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,320
Normally a couple is formed with a male and a female.

166
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,960
Senior Brother, yours is a female role. Were you looking for a male player?

167
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,040
You are wrong. The one I wanted was a demon.

168
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,090
Could this work, too?

169
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,380
Of course.

170
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,110
There's a male role in that game,

171
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,260
called Flower Arrow.

172
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,420
It was designed to be extremely feminine.

173
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,140
Most guys wouldn't know how to play that role.

174
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,450
On the contrary, girls loved it.

175
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,550
I was thinking at the time. I should find Flower Arrow.

176
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,530
I specifically found a name which clearly belonged to a girl.

177
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,170
Her name was Shouke Zhaixingchen.
<i>(It means the hand that can pluck the stars)</i>

178
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,000
This name sounds very audacious and imposing.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,860
Why did it have to come from a female?

180
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,420
I... At that time, I also thought that...

181
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,470
only girls would want to pluck stars.

182
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,070
At that time, in order to show how thoughtful I was

183
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,490
I deliberately didn't ask about gender.

184
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,240
In the end, when I found out,

185
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,410
it was a... shemale among the demons.

186
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,350
It's so complicated. Was that person a male or a female?

187
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,900
He was a pure male.

188
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,950
- What happened after that?
- Later...

189
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,990
Nothing happened. After I found out that he was a guy,

190
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,570
I never touched that game again.

191
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,720
Senior Brother Beauty, you only know how to blame others.

192
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,290
Frankly, you impersonated a female and tricked him of his feelings.

193
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,090
You then abandoned him.

194
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,230
Jerk.

195
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm not a jerk. My initial motive

196
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,210
was very pure.

197
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,690
Was that server called "Chang'an under the Moon?"

198
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,920
How did you know that?

199
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,380
Because I am Shouke Zhaixingchen.

200
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,170
My stomach hurts. Junior Sister Weiwei,

201
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,750
- take me to the hospital now.
- Oh, oh!

202
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,450
It's that serious?

203
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,450
The thunder and lightning were so scary.

204
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,200
Their gazes were so fierce.

205
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,800
Simply put, this is fate.

206
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,360
It's definitely an ill-fated one.

207
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,790
Junior Sister.

208
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,220
Senior Brother.

209
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,490
Let's go back to the office.

210
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,090
Yes.

211
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,100
CEO Xiao, the fried rice that you asked for was sold out.

212
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,050
I just brought some vegetables and beef with rice for you.

213
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,890
It's okay with you, right?

214
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,490
Whatever.

215
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,640
Miss Bei, get me a glass of water, please.

216
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,650
I already prepared in advance. Here.

217
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,700
Master, please enjoy.

218
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,730
Why are you so thoughtful today?

219
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,260
Being thoughtful is my nature.

220
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,710
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

221
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,280
Diemeng asked to meet me. She previously treated me. It's my turn now.

222
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,900
Is this the case?

223
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,680
I thought you were trying to avoid swimming with me.

224
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,490
Not at all, President Xiao.

225
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,670
Since this is the case, we will go tomorrow.

226
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,200
All right, go to your meeting.

227
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,120
There will be thunderstorms tonight. You are not allowed to get rained on. Do you hear me?

228
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,950
Yep, as ordered.

229
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,020
Don't forget to drink the juice of love I brought you. Bye-bye.

230
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,250
<i>[Bob Hair Salon]</i>

231
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,350
My four mademoiselles, please get in the car.

232
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,390
Wow, this car is so cool.

233
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,240
Yes, the guy is so good looking as well.

234
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,690
<i>Hello. This way, please.</i>

235
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,000
So, you are Zhenshui?

236
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,230
You are Yaoyao?

237
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,780
We didn't think of that at all when we saw you at the entrance just now.

238
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,710
That's right. Even though we saw your photos, we couldn't recognize you.

239
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,680
Yaoyao is so much better looking than in the photo.

240
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,220
Okay, almost everyone is here.

241
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,470
It's my treat today. Order whatever you like.

242
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,850
Okay. Waitress, bring the menu.

243
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,500
We won't be standing on ceremony with the tycoon then.

244
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,710
Why isn't Luwei Weiwei here yet?

245
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,170
Sister Diemeng, when will she be here?

246
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,780
Couldn't it be that she won't be coming?

247
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,160
She has always kept her words.

248
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,030
She will definitely show up.

249
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,330
We are really looking forward to this.

250
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,370
<i>It's such a high-end place.</i>

251
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,460
<i>Did I bring enough money?</i>

252
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,410
<i>I don't care. In the worst-case scenario, I will call for help from Master.</i>

253
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,770
Simply Chrysanthemum Pavilion?

254
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,590
Why does it sound like a private room?

255
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,040
Everyone.

256
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,940
- She's here.
- What?

257
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,750
- Luwei Weiwei?
- Here?

258
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,500
- Where?
- She's here?
- Which one?

259
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,490
Sister Diemeng said that Luwei Weiwei is a beauty.

260
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,300
I really want to see what she looks like.

261
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,230
Me too! Sister Diemeng, is Luwei Weiwei as pretty as Yaoyao?

262
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,980
You'll find out when she is here.

263
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,960
Of course, she's not as pretty as Yaoyao.

264
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,950
Yaoyao is the most beautiful girl in our server.

265
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,490
Enough, stop exaggerating and comparing me to everyone.

266
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,480
Okay, I will stop comparing.

267
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,740
How can any girl compete with our Yaoyao?

268
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,870
<i>If it weren't for you, Tianxia and Xiaoyu Qingqing wouldn't have met,</i>

269
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,480
<i>and Tianxia and I wouldn't be how we are today.</i>

270
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,000
<i>I want you to understand my pain</i>

271
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,450
<i>and we'll see if you can still smile then.</i>

272
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,630
Miss, this way, please.

273
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,590
Is she here?

274
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,230
She must be here.

275
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,430
<i>Here, here. She's here.</i>

276
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,150
My god.

277
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,530
Are you kidding me? You call her a beauty?

278
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,290
Geez.

279
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,670
Miss, this way, please.

280
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,470
How can this be?

281
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,590
Weiwei,

282
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,650
it's so great that you came to this gathering.

283
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,410
Gathering?

284
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,110
Do me a favor. I'll explain to you later.

285
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,920
I saved you a seat. It's over there. Let's sit down.

286
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,510
That's her.

287
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,630
She is a real beauty.

288
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,990
Are you Luwei Weiwei?

289
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,040
Yes.

290
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,290
So pretty!

291
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,410
Beauty.

292
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,900
Hello, everyone. I am Luwei Weiwei.

293
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,890
No way. You must be lying.

294
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,360
Yes, how can you lie without getting the story right?

295
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,960
We've all seen Luwei Weiwei before

296
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,290
and you do not look like her at all.

297
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,440
You have seen Luwei Weiwei before?

298
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,330
Of course, the real Luwei Weiwei works at Zhengshui's company.

299
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,520
Not only does she look very ordinary, her style and taste in dress are also very poor.

300
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,090
She wore a flannel shirt and is a typical IT woman.

301
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,700
Who are you? Why are you pretending to be Luwei Weiwei?

302
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,910
I know.

303
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,000
Luwei Weiwei is afraid to see us,

304
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,120
so she paid you to come.

305
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,670
Flannel shirt?

306
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,900
<i>Today, the Young Master's girlfriends came.</i>

307
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,220
<i>It was really an eye-opener!</i>

308
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,910
<i>- Girlfriends?</i>
<i>- In any case, it was a band of women.</i>

309
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,520
<i>They all looked the same and dressed the same.</i>

310
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
<i>But this isn't the key. The key is that</i>

311
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,100
<i>I, a highly skilled intern,</i>

312
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,710
<i>was used like a maid by them today!</i>

313
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,260
<i>They also spilled coffee on my white sneakers. I washed them all night but still couldn't get them clean.</i>

314
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,250
<i>I don't want to live!</i>

315
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,000
<i>So they are the ones who tortured Erxi. That is so over-the-line.</i>

316
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,890
<i>I need to get revenge for Erxi.</i>

317
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,950
I don't know who you are talking about.

318
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,780
In the games, there are many similar user names.

319
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,700
Didn't you guys use to have a small account

320
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,550
named Luwei Weiwei?
<i>(Note: Account created to mock the original Luwei Weiwi with homonyms of derogatory meaning) </i>

321
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,330
Also, if her user name is really Luwei Weiwei, it could also have been from another server.

322
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,020
How can it be a coincidence? You must be fake.

323
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,440
You don't believe me.

324
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,680
We don't know if she's legitimate.

325
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,000
Is there anyone who brought their laptop here today?

326
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,750
- I brought it.
- I also brought mine.

327
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,510
Right, if she logs in then it can prove her identity.

328
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,720
How does that prove her identity?

329
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
If she is a real impostor, then she probably has the password.

330
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,660
I can fake the user name, but no one can fake my gaming skills.

331
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,370
How about this? I'll PK the four of you.

332
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,370
If I win four rounds in a row,

333
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,140
will that prove that I am Luwei Weiwei?

334
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,050
PK?

335
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,510
What? Are you scared?

336
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,950
That's a good idea.

337
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,120
Not anyone can fake Luwei Weiwei's gaming skills.

338
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,530
Right, right. Otherwise, we don't know who to believe.

339
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,890
Let's PK. Who's afraid?

340
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,680
Next.

341
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,390
Continue.

342
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,610
She slew her so quickly.

343
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,960
Her control is too amazing.

344
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,820
It seems that you are the real Luwei Weiwei.

345
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,790
We got it wrong.

346
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,690
Let's not continue the PK.

347
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,560
We are all here for the gathering. There's no need for fighting.

348
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,070
For this type of gaming gathering, it's fun to PK.

349
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,630
We've agreed to 4 rounds, then 4 rounds it is.

350
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,120
What? Are you scared?

351
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,980
Let's just stop. It appears that we were mistaken.

352
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,000
Please give me some consideration. It is a gathering today for everyone.

353
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,760
There is no need to get so hostile.

354
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,600
Who are you?

355
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,300
I am Zhenshui Wuxiang.

356
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,800
It's you.

357
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,630
Then how about if you play in her place?

358
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,880
How can I bully a girl?

359
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,680
Then stop the yapping. Let's start.

360
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,970
She's literally toying with her.

361
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,690
Yes, Xiaoyu Yaoyao is so pitiful.

362
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,530
Luwei Weiwei is only toying with her. She doesn't kill her.

363
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,150
It's like "Tom and Jerry."

364
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,330
Hey, Luwei Weiwei, if you want to PK, then do it the way it should be done.

365
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,060
Why are you tormenting her? What do you want?

366
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,100
Is it fun to torment others?

367
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,390
You should know that better than anyone else.

368
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,110
What do you mean?

369
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,110
Nothing.

370
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,660
After finishing the first three rounds, I'm a little tired.

371
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,070
So I want to rest a little.

372
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,280
Play slowly.

373
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,760
Zhenshui.

374
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,230
Zhenshui.

375
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,330
It's a game. Don't take it too seriously. Just a game.

376
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,010
Yes, Yaoyao. It's a game. We are just having fun.

377
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,480
You lose if you take it too seriously.

378
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,930
How about it? Can this prove now

379
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,700
that I am really Luwei Weiwei?

380
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,010
Yes, yes. Weiwei you are so amazing.

381
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,690
I can't believe not only is Luwei Weiwei not a transvestite as rumored,

382
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,610
she's also such a beauty. You were too low-key before.

383
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:31,980
Originally, I thought Xiaoyu Yaoyao was very pretty,

384
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,520
but when Luwei came in, it's as if she just disappeared.

385
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,890
Yeah, Yaoyao just becomes part of the background.

386
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,530
So nobody has any doubt now, right?

387
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,460
We are just here for the gathering.

388
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,710
We are not here to suspect anyone.

389
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,320
Yaoyao and Qingqing, you two are really great at everything

390
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,920
but just too suspicious of others.

391
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,650
Weiwei, let's go back and sit. Let's have a seat, everyone.

392
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,110
Let's go.

393
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,020
<i>She's great.</i>

394
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,160
<i>Let's go back to our seats.</i>

395
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,030
Luwei,

396
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,130
I am Zhan Tianxia.

397
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,530
We had some misunderstanding in the game before,

398
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,020
but since we have all met today,

399
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,670
I think we should all forget what happened in the game.

400
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,510
Of course.

401
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,610
I don't need to introduce you to these folks.

402
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,900
You guys have already played face-to-face already.

403
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,780
Luwei, you truly are as fierce as in the game.

404
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,300
You too.

405
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,550
Since we all have introduced each other, let's start.

406
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,360
Waitress,

407
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,210
you may start serving. Please add a trout and two lobsters.

408
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,650
It's too expensive.

409
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,670
Zhenshui, you are so rich.

410
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,460
It's nothing. Have fun everyone.

411
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,140
If it weren't for Zhenshui, we wouldn't be eating here today.

412
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,380
Everything on the menu is three digits, at least.

413
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,840
Yes, Zhenshui is always generous.

414
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,290
He always treats everyone no matter where he goes.

415
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,530
Weiwei, your dress is so pretty.

416
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,710
How much is it?

417
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,720
I picked it up on the way. I don't remember.

418
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,520
Weiwei, what should we call you?

419
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,120
You can call me Luwei.

420
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,160
Weiwei, I remember you are also a student.

421
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,530
What school do you go to?

422
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,080
My school has good food.

423
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,980
The brand of Tsinghua University, the food of Beijing Institute of Technology;
<i>(Note: She's listing what these schools are famous for)</i>

424
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,020
the women in Beijing Foreign Studies University, the men in Beihang University.

425
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,940
So you're from the Beijing Institute of Technology?

426
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,990
What do you study?

427
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,910
Computer science.

428
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,030
I'm also from the Computer Science Department of Beijing Institute of Technology,

429
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,010
but why have I never seen you before?

430
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,910
<i>What a coincidence! I wanted to mislead them.</i>

431
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,220
<i>Yet I got caught.</i>

432
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,680
Many working women nowadays

433
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,920
like to claim that they are college students.

434
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,770
As a girl,

435
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,520
how could you have such dirty thoughts?

436
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,740
Which campus are you from?

437
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,440
Quanshan District.

438
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,680
You can't move onto the main campus until your junior year, right?

439
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,430
So, you are senior at the main campus. No wonder I have never seen you.

440
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,910
But you don't look older than me at all.

441
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,460
Why has it been raining lately?

442
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,410
It's okay. We can go next door for karaoke later. We won't be drenched.

443
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,870
<i>Okay, let's go for karaoke.</i>

444
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,540
<i>This is a good idea. This deserves a toast. I love singing.</i>

445
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,960
Hello.

446
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,860
The rain is too heavy. I will pick you up.

447
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,000
You can come now.

448
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,650
Weiwei, your boyfriend?

449
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,180
Yes.

450
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,510
Weiwei, why are you in such a hurry to leave?

451
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,790
We are going to a KTV after this. Join us.

452
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,800
Yes, I want to hear a beautiful woman sing.

453
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,110
That's right. Your boyfriend can join us, too.

454
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,270
It's rare for us to meet and you are leaving so soon?

455
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,830
<i>That's right.</i>

456
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,700
<i>Join us.</i>

457
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,770
No, I'm not going.

458
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,240
I still have some matters in the evening.

459
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,680
Waitress, bring the bill.

460
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,720
All right. Please wait.

461
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,480
<i>It's still raining so hard.</i>

462
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,990
<i>How can we leave?</i>

463
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,050
<i>This rain won't stop anytime soon.</i>

464
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,000
Go for your karaoke. No need to be here with me.

465
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,670
How can we do that?

466
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,960
Letting a great beauty wait here alone in the rain for her boyfriend

467
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,910
- is not appropriate.
- That's right.

468
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,910
That's right.

469
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,010
He will be here soon. It's fine.

470
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:11,400
- It's just singing. It's not a big deal to sing one more song.
- That's right.

471
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,350
I think, you're just waiting to see

472
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,000
what the beauty's boyfriend looks like.

473
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,920
I'm guessing that I'm not the only one.

474
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,020
I want to see Luwei Weiwei's boyfriend

475
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,210
and what he looks like.

476
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,300
Zhenshui is handsome and rich. His family's company is also publicly listed.

477
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,140
With regards to boyfriend, Yaoyao will definitely win.

478
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,180
<i>He's here.</i>

479
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,610
<i>So, it's him.</i>

480
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,990
<i>Look. He's so good looking.</i>

481
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,030
Have fun. I'm leaving first.

482
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,240
Weiwei, why don't you ask your boyfriend to join us?

483
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,120
After all, it's a rare opportunity.

484
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,990
No, he's an introvert.

485
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,110
He doesn't like meeting strangers.

486
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,810
Let's go.

487
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,270
Hey! Did you know that your girlfriend married several men in online games?

488
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,650
Did you know that?

489
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,140
She seduces men and creates havoc in online games.

490
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,150
Her reputation is really awful.

491
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,630
Everyone here knows about it.

492
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,380
This handsome guy, don't be tricked by her.

493
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,960
As long as she's willing to be with me,

494
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,920
I don't care about this.

495
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,400
I have always known you were an expert in agitating others,

496
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,070
but I didn't expect your acting skill to be so good.

497
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,670
Just now, Xiaoyu Qingqing wanted to drive us apart

498
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,280
to make you dump me.

499
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,640
I didn't expect you to put up the look,

500
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,450
"Even if she had an affair,

501
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,970
you still wouldn't regret this."

502
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,200
A master is indeed a master.

503
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,650
If I really have an affair,

504
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,870
would you really not mind?

505
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,420
I wouldn't.

506
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,310
I thought you would cut me off.

507
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,040
At the most,

508
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,050
if you went over the wall by an inch, I'd move the wall an inch.

509
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,810
If you went over a foot,

510
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,970
I'd move it ten feet.

511
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,710
Coffee?

512
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,020
Coffee. Little Coffee.

513
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,110
Little...

514
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,880
Coffee.

515
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,410
I knew you would be here.

516
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,790
I haven't seen you for a long time. Have you been well-behaved?

517
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,660
It seems someone has been taking good care of you.

518
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,610
Having dinner alone must be wonderful, too. Let's start.

519
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,750
<i>Wei Guang, you are finally online. </i>

520
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,920
<i>I will wait for you at the same old place in Jinling City,</i>

521
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,680
<i>Come here now.</i>

522
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,980
