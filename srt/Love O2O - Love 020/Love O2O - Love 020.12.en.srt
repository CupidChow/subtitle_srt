Is this your office?

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,230
Yes.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,870
It's Sunday today, so no one is here.

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,630
Come on in.

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,220
Isn't this the Puppet Maker from "A Chinese Ghost Story"?

32
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,450
Yes. Come here.

33
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,150
- This is...
- My office.

34
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,130
Can you study here?

35
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,890
Yes, that works.

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,500
Then, I will get started.

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,470
I also have work to do.

38

<i>It's so quiet, but it's a little too quiet. </i>

<i>I can't seem to focus on the book. There are only me and Master here.</i>

40
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,360
Weiwei... come and take a look at this.

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,130
What is this?

42
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,990
Basic character design for our mobile game.

43
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,030
Your mobile game?

44
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes. Take a look.

45
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,090
I like this game.

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,900
Just from the character design?

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,290
No, but you can tell a lot from just the character design.

48
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,090
These mobile games nowadays, in order to appeal to male players, female characters in online games

49
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,640
wear really skimpy outfits.

50
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,030
I can hardly bear to look at some of them. That's why I picked the Red Clothed Lady Blade Master.

51
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,540
On one hand, I like her skill set,

52
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,320
and also because she is very covered up.

53
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,720
However, your game is not like that.

54
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,680
I see that all the outfits of the female characters are very normal.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,200
This shows that the game designers are very confident in their own work

56
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,690
and have respect for their game. They're not using frivolous methods to please others.

57
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,290
Thanks for the compliment. I am honored.

58
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,610
<i>Master seems to be in a very good mood!</i>

59
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,990
<i>Did I butter him up by accident?</i>

60
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,930
When is the beta test then?

61
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,230
At the earliest, probably the end of the year.

62
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,150
I want a beta test account.

63
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,530
Well...

64
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,570
Can't I have one?

65
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,400
That depends on the favorability for each other.

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,730
<i>Master is so− He wants to check our favorability?</i>

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,710
<i> No, I can't let him get the last word all the time.</i>

68
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,760
Then, how does one increase his favorability?

69
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,660
I'll come up with the calculation model.

70
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,460
By the way, about Feng Teng's offer to buy the copyright of our video,

71
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,820
what did you mean when you said it's a little complicated?

72
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,280
Our company is very likely to collaborate with Feng Teng for this mobile game,

73
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,690
and at the same time, trying to secure the joint development of "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

74
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,890
"A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

75
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,970
Yes, it hasn't been announced yet.

76
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,170
Since you knew them already, why don't you handle the video matter, too?

77
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,840
That would really be the best. The video was released under my name,

78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,620
but you were the one who did it. Let's not sell it then.

79
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,300
If you don't end up working with them, we can just save the idea for ourselves.

80
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,420
Don't worry about that. You should just sign the contract.

81
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,450
Okay, then. I'll sign it and split the licensing fee five ways.

82
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,390
No need to give it to Yugong and the others.

83
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,720
Wouldn't that be wrong? They took part in it, too.

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,070
Just keep it as their welcoming gift to you.

85
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,970
<i> I was going to ask him,</i>

86
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,710
<i>what I should do about his cut. Now, I should just skip it. </i>

87
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,570
<i> What if he says to take it as a betrothal gift?</i>

88
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,430
<i>I thought it was weird why he kept standing over there.</i>

89
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,360
<i> It's because I'm in this chair.</i>

90
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,550
The limited edition mug of "A Chinese Ghost Story?"

91
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,560
That's yours.

92
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,220
There are more, right? There are twenty characters in the game.

93
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,060
Then, a set must have twenty mugs, right?

94
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,180
Feng Teng gave us the set.

95
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,270
I only took these two. Yugong and the others have the rest of the set.

96
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,790
<i>So, he saved the mug for me.</i>

97
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,060
<i>He knew I would come to his office sooner or later.</i>

98
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,170
Xiao Nai...

99
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,890
How did you recognize me on that day?

100
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,060
Xiao Nai?

101
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,610
At Acme, in March.

102
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,590
At the internet cafe?

103
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,920
I happened to be there for some business,

104
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,060
and on my way out, I saw you PK someone.

105
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,300
<i>So, Master knew me from that far back then.</i>

106
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,120
Your maneuvering was great and your hand speed rapid.

107
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,500
It's the result of training after I worked as a QC tester during the summer of my senior year in high school.

108
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,280
My APM wasn't actually very high, less than 150.
<i>(APM - actions per minute)</i>

109
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,410
APM is only a reference point.

110
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,760
Compared to the APM, perhaps the effective maneuver rate is more critical.

111
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,930
Master, then what is your APM?

112
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,140
I've never tested. When I started playing, the concept of APM didn't exist then.

113
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,280
No APM? How long ago was that?

114
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,610
<i> Master must be super handsome while he is playing. </i>

115
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,390
Why don't we have a one-on-one sometime?

116
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,450
Sure, but I need to ask Mis−

117
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,500
to take it easy on me.

118
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,210
<i> Why do I get the feeling that where he paused, </i>

119
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,170
he was going to say, "Missus, take it easy on me"?

120
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,520
<i>I must be going mad today.</i>

121
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,620
Then, I will study now.

122
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,870
<i>Since he knew me that long ago,</i>

123
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,660
<i> why didn't he mention that in the game?</i>

124
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,270
<i>We also saw each other in the archaeology class, too. Wait, this isn't right.</i>

125
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,160
<i> I've taken his class, too. You don't have to say nice things about him.</i>

126
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,010
<i>That's right. I sat next to you once.</i>

127
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,680
<i> I know.</i>

128
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,060
<i> So, that is what that meant by "I know!"</i>

129
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,930
Weiwei...

130
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,080
If you keep staring at me, I won't be able to take it anymore.

131
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,640
- Yeah!
- Good!

132
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,440
When wandering in the world! You can't avoid the sword! Three cuts and you're dead!

133
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,460
Five cuts and you're dead! Give it here!

134
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,710
<i>[Eastern Bird]</i>

135
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,840
All right, all right. Time for the sub! The backup player Hao Mei takes the court.

136
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,960
Hey! There you go!

137
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,930
- Oh, that's nice!
- Beautiful!
- I'll get it myself!

138
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,130
I'll shoot! I'll shoot!

139
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,990
I'll do it! I'll do it!

140
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,940
- Move over!
- Nice shot!

141
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,750
How can you do that? What kind of friends did I get? Come on.

142
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,000
That guy! He dumps his brothers and goes off on a date! And the two of you?

143
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,650
You treat me like rubbish!

144
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,340
Never mind the fact that I work so hard to raise the visual standards of this dorm!

145
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,410
And this is how you thank me?

146
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,800
Catch the ball! Shoot!

147
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,520
Fine! You will not defeat the hot blood of a man this way! Just wait!

148
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,830
<i>♫ Yeah! Doo doo ♫ </i>

149
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,490
Dear audience! Dear audience!

150
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,340
Let me present to you the hottest All-Star soccer match in history!

151
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,000
There is not a single seat that is unfilled in this arena!

152
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,760
And our Hao Mei has already been flooded by the viewers' enthusiasm!

153
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,930
Now, Hao Mei catches the ball! Only to see him go left foot! Right foot!

154
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,610
A hesitation move and he dodges past the opposing team player!

155
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,360
His movement is agile, his steps swift!

156
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,240
In a flash, he dodges past eight opposing team players!

157
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,450
Directly across from the goal keeper, he shoots!

158
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,870
Please enjoy your meal.

159
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,500
Thank you.

160
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,560
<i>My productivity this afternoon has been terrible.</i>

161
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,170
<i>Maybe I'll slip back to the dorm after we're done eating.</i>

162
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,160
Do you want to PK with me?

163
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,260
Yeah!

164
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,130
Are you feeling better?

165
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,530
Who would've thought you'd catch a cold even before your stomach flu was over?

166
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,150
Don't be so sick.

167
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,470
If you have a cold, you should take some medicine. Here, have these.

168
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,170
I can always count on you.

169
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,430
Those two are taken now, so once the weekend is here, they're out on dates,

170
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,520
and we can't even catch a glimpse of them.

171
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,150
Here.

172
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,460
You find true love in a crisis!

173
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,840
- Si Si.
- Huh?

174
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,400
From now on, it's just the two of us.

175
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,270
That's right. Even if you're sick and have a cold, you should stay cheerful.

176
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,690
You're healthier if you smile!

177
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,390
Besides, there is a guy who asked me to study with him.

178
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,130
Why don't you hang out with your computer instead?

179
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,760
I... I'm going to go now!

180
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,650
Hey, Si Si!

181
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,390
Heartless! Heartless! Everyone's leaving me one at a time!

182
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,480
This won't do. I need to find my own chicken soup of the soul.

183
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,400
<i>Huhuhu... I'm sick.</i>

184
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,820
<i>I feel terrible. I'm so pitiful.</i>

185
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,050
<i>You're here. Where are you? I'll come to see you.</i>

186
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,100
<i>I'm by Mo Chou Lake in Jinling City</i>

187
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,910
<i>Wait for me.</i>

188
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,970
<i>Okay!</i>

189
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,570
What a beautiful horse!

190
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,320
This horse is for you.

191
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,960
What? Really? That's wonderful!

192
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,840
But this horse must have cost you a lot.

193
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,400
This gift is too valuable.

194
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,760
This horse is especially good at "the split."
<i>(Note: slang term implying two-timing)</i>

195
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,090
When it runs, it spreads its legs really wide so it runs really fast.

196
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,580
I think it suits you really well.

197
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,080
I like this horse very much!

198
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,310
No matter how fast it runs, as long as it's from you, I would like it.

199
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,610
<i>Go on acting. Let's see how far you can take this.</i>

200
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,220
<i>I'll go with you all the way.</i>

201
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,870
Would you like to go boating?

202
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,970
Here? I didn't know you could do that in the game.

203
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,330
I saw a few boats over there on my way here. We should be able to take them.

204
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,840
All right!

205
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,310
- I'd like two boats please.
- All right.

206
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,610
Why do we need two? We can just take one.

207
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,850
Isn't it more fun with two boats?

208
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,290
I think you'd like it.

209
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,160
<i>That's to say, straddling two boats.
(Note: another common slang term for two-timing)</i>

210
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,370
<i>How can you not get that?</i>

211
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,330
That's true! We can have a race to see who rows faster!

212
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,530
There's no way I could beat you.

213
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,440
Oh, you! Let's go together!

214
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,460
What flower is that? It's so beautiful!

215
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,360
My guess is it's called... a poplar flower.

216
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,020
Huh? Why's that?

217
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Look, the poplar branches fell into the water before they had a chance to bloom.

218
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,290
But they didn't give up because of that,

219
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,180
so they bloomed in the water.

220
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,780
How poetic!

221
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,070
Why is it that when you put it that way

222
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,230
it makes me feel like these flowers have had it hard?

223
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,800
Poplar flowers that bloom in the water...

224
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,810
That made me think of an idiom: "Unpredictable as water, fluttery as a poplar blossom"
<i>(Note: an idiom that suggest a fickle woman)</i>

225
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,190
<i>At least, it seems you have some self-awareness.</i>

226
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,220
I used to think that was a negative idiom.

227
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,850
But now, it feels warm and inspiring.

228
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,430
Weiguang,

229
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,040
you always give me wonderful surprises.

230
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,640
<i>I also want to give you a gift.</i>

231
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,220
<i>It has to be really special and valuable</i>

232
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,430
<i>to live up to how thoughtful you are to me.</i>

233
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,260
Weiwei, you're back at the perfect time!

234
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,470
What's up?

235
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,640
Why is your face so red? Do you have a fever?

236
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,080
No fever! I just have a cold. I took some pills and feel better already.

237
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,660
You're back at the perfect time.

238
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,780
If I want to give a friend a gift in the game;

239
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,150
a meaningful and unique gift,

240
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,560
what should I give?

241
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,350
- How did you have the same idea as mine?
- Do you also want to give Master a gift?

242
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,330
Yup!

243
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,070
Erxi!

244
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,290
- Did you meet someone in the game−
- No, no! I am not like you!

245
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,920
It's just that a friend in the game did a favor for me, and I just want to pay it back.

246
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,090
- I'm just paying it back!
- Mmmm!

247
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,550
What are you going to give Master?

248
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,390
I'd like to make something for him myself.

249
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Make it yourself? Like what?

250
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,900
You've been playing the game for so long. Don't tell me you don't know that you can craft your own gear and name them?

251
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,230
I'd like to make one for him but I am still missing two rare ingredients.

252
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,850
You can do that in the game, too?

253
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,940
Yeah! But crafting gear yourself takes a lot of time.

254
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,200
If you don't have that much time, you can think about giving something else.

255
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,530
I'm going to wash my face first.

256
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,660
Crafting gear myself...

257
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,070
Sure enough, men are vindictive.

258
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,960
But that's good.

259
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,200
<i> Yiran, where should we go for coffee later?</i>

260
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,960
- Let's go to our usual spot!
- Okay!

261
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,560
Yiran!

262
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,280
Why didn't you come back to the dorm yesterday? You didn't drink the juice I bought you.

263
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,890
- I'm not going back to the dorm anytime soon.
- Wait!

264
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,240
Why not? You were doing well at the dorm. Why are you not staying any longer?

265
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,320
No reason.

266
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,160
Let me show you something.

267
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,220
It's about Xiao Nai and Bei Weiwei.

268
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,230
I'm not interested in their business!

269
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,840
Let's go.

270
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,570
Suit yourself. You'll regret it.

271
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,900
This is my business card.

272
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,890
- Hello, Mr. Liu.
- Hello.

273
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,300
Our customer service had contacted you already.

274
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,720
We've decided to use "The Musician and the Bandit" as our promotion video.

275
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,470
We'd also like to incorporate bandit's abduction of bridegrooms into our gameplay.

276
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,020
I've watched the video you made for the game. It's really good. The story is innovative.

277
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,750
I can see why your video won first place in the contest.

278
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,200
Thank you for your compliment.

279
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,690
<i>Sir, may I take your order?</i>

280
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,550
Just coffee, thank you.

281
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,540
Miss Bei, do you have thoughts about payment terms?

282
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,050
I wanted to hear your ideas first.

283
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,140
We're willing to pay ¥20,000 to buy the rights to use your video for three years.

284
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,590
Of course, that also includes the fees of using your creative ideas.

285
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,460
Just recently, the game released some new rare Majestic Beasts.

286
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,850
Instead of cash, can I get the Majestic Beasts in the game?

287
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,890
That should work. How many of these did you have in mind? And at what level?

288
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,450
I would like five top-level rare Majestic Beasts.

289
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,290
The top-level rare Majestic Beasts?

290
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,290
Well...

291
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,200
Here you go.

292
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,980
Miss Bei, five top-level rare Majestic Beasts

293
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,850
cost more than ¥20,000.

294
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,460
It's just data to you, right?

295
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,940
That will severely affect the balance in the game. Our manager would never agree.

296
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,640
Then what should we do? I just wanted to give them

297
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,540
to my friends in the game as a gift.

298
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,570
You know that I and my friends are already at very high levels in the game.

299
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,770
We'll get the best Majestic Beasts sooner or later.

300
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,050
So it shouldn't disrupt the player balance too much, right?

301
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,610
But to give out five beasts at once...

302
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,860
We can't really justify that to the other players.

303
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,240
How about this? Miss Bei, I could give you some young Majestic Beasts.

304
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,570
Okay, then. The young Majestic Beasts will do,

305
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,280
but I'd also like to get two kinds of materials.

306
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,540
Tianshan White Jade, and Nine Heavens Jade Fire.

307
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,150
These two kinds of materials are very hard to obtain.

308
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,060
Since Miss Bei is so agreeable, I'll accept the terms.

309
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,720
I've brought the contract today. I'll make the changes, and you can take a look.

310
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,870
Miss Bei, if there are no other questions about the contract,

311
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,490
let's sign.

312
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,320
The contract should be fine.

313
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,070
Okay.

314
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,970
Thank you very much! We'll send the items you've requested to your account

315
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,530
by 8:00 p.m. the day after tomorrow. Here's to a great partnership.

316
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,190
Goodbye.

317
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,030
Yes!

318
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,080
<i>[Tsinghua University Job Fair]</i>

319
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,470
<i>- So many people!
- We have to do our best no matter how many.</i>

320
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,980
<i>This is the last large job fair before we graduate.</i>

321
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,640
<i>All the big companies are here.</i>

322
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,370
<i>- Besides, this is the last job fair before we graduate.
- That's right!</i>

323
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,150
<i>Before long we'll be leaving school,</i>

324
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,690
<i>I don't know how many couples will also be breaking up.</i>

325
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,990
<i>At least, after we graduate, we'll be working next to each other.</i>

326
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,470
Today, I was really resourceful.

327
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,850
Ask for something impossible first before lowering my demand.

328
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,760
The other party became so much more susceptible to agreeing to it.

329
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,780
The day after tomorrow, I'll give Master and the rest a big graduation present.

330
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,030
<i>He's really not online. Yugong and Houzi Jiu aren't online, either.</i>

331
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,850
<i>Mo Zhata is online.</i>

332
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,570
<i>Junior Weiwei.</i>

333
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,340
<i>Senior Mr. Beauty.</i>

334
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,820
<i>Who told you that nickname? I'm 1.8 meters tall, stronger than an ox, </i>

335
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,810
<i>and more tanned than charcoal. What is this Mr. Beauty?!</i>

336
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,560
<i>Hao Mei didn't see you at the basketball game last time.</i>

337
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,650
<i>He keep saying that he wants to meet you.</i>

338
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,170
<i>Hao Mei?</i>

339
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,040
<i>Mo Zhata.</i>

340
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,300
<i>Hao Mei?</i>

341
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,340
<i>What an elegant name!
(Note: His name sounds like "So Beautiful" in Mandarin.)</i>

342
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,470
<i>His mom had a dream at Emei Mountain that he would be a girl.</i>

343
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,860
<i>Before he was born, his parents had the name Hao Mei for him.</i>

344
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,290
<i>Yugong and the others like to tease him by calling him Mr. Beauty.</i>

345
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,390
<i>I can't say that Master was the one who told me.</i>

346
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,830
<i>But it is also bad to lie to him.</i>

347
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,880
<i>I know.</i>

348
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,740
<i>That day, at the basketball game,</i>

349
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,590
<i>I saw Yugong and Houzi Jiu.</i>

350
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,240
How can the two of you betray me?

351
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,650
Who said you could talk trash about me?

352
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,930
What trash is it?

353
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,690
<i>Just had a PK in real life.</i>

354
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,520
<i>Yugong and Houzi Jiu?</i>

355
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,510
<i>I beat them down until they begged for mercy with a bleeding nose and swollen face.</i>

356
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,760
<i>Don't worry. I didn't say it was you.</i>

357
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,960
<i>Senior Brother, actually I think</i>

358
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,010
<i>you are very lucky.</i>

359
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,820
<i>Didn't your name come from Emei Mountain?</i>

360
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,940
<i>If you weren't named Hao Mei, </i>

361
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,340
<i>wouldn't you be called Hao E?</i>

362
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,540
<i>Hao E sounds like "Hao E (So Hungry)" and would be even weirder.</i>

363
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,570
<i>Would you rather have a guy call you "So Hungry" or "So Beautiful" while walking down the street?</i>

364
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,110
<i>I've thought about it this time and again for many years.</i>

365
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,870
<i>Actually, I could have been called "Hao Shan (Good Mountain)."</i>

366
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,920
<i>"Hao Shan."</i>

367
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,850
<i>I'm just missing the Tianshan White Jade</i>

368
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,410
<i> and the Nine Heavens Jade Fire for the hairpin I want to make.</i>

369
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,930
<i>I'm just waiting for them to be sent over, then I can put them together.</i>

370
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,530
<i>Weiwei, you're finally here.</i>

371
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,090
<i>I thought you had quit playing like Chief Diemeng.</i>

372
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,730
<i>I didn't quit. I was just busy with exams.</i>

373
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,980
<i>Are you free right now, Weiwei?</i>

374
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,130
<i>- What is it?
- Help me kill an Underworld Ghostly Hag, a new monster.</i>

375
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,820
<i>I've tried twice and still couldn't pass. Have you done that quest yet?</i>

376
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,700
<i>I wonder how the GM will give me the Majestic Beasts?</i>

377
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,260
<i>It will be so inconvenient if they give me Majestic Beasts during the battle.</i>

378
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,480
<i>How about after 8:00 p.m.? I have something to do beforehand.</i>

379
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,730
<i>Okay, I will wait for you.</i>

380
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,920
<i>Oh, Majestic Beasts! Once I give these Majestic Beasts to Master and his guys,</i>

381
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,390
<i>then everyone in the group will have one.</i>

382
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,010
<i>How cool will it be when we all walk about with the Majestic Beasts all lined up?</i>

383
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,570
<i>Senior Mr. Beauty, hurry over. I have a rare Majestic Beast.</i>

384
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,360
Wow!

385
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:41,180
Third Sister-in-Law, how did you know that this Majestic Beast is a perfect match with my character?

386
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,040
<i>I've always wanted one since forever, but I could never get my hands on one.</i>

387
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,410
<i>Sure enough that it's best when we share the joy together.</i>

388
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,180
<i>Third Sister-in-Law, where did you get these Majestic Beasts?</i>

389
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,950
<i>You are so amazing.</i>

390
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,860
<i>It was what the company that bought our "Musician and the Bandit" video gave us. </i>

391
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,660
All the main characters in the video will get one.

392
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,800
When did the company become so generous as to give sub-character Majestic Beasts?

393
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,060
<i>You asked for them, didn't you?</i>

394
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,850
<i>If you know, then don't talk about it. Just be touched in silence.</i>

395
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,930
<i>Oh, I'm so moved. Third Brother married well.</i>

396
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,680
<i>Third Brother married well.</i>

397
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,950
<i>When a man gets to the top, all his friends move up as well.</i>

398
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,940
<i>Third Sister-in-Law, there's something I need to report to you.</i>

399
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,630
<i>What?</i>

400
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,310
<i>Someone called the dorm today to confess to Third Brother.</i>

401
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,430
<i>[Oh...]</i>

402
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,170
<i>Really! I picked up the call. It was a girl.</i>

403
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,120
<i>But I heard Third Brother turn her down.</i>

404
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,190
<i>A confession?</i>

405
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,310
<i>Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry. With me here,</i>

406
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,010
<i>I absolutely won't let Third Brother be unfaithful.</i>

407
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:24,160
<i>Senior, stay calm. It's just a confession, not a big deal.</i>

408
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,820
<i> People have been confessing to me all my life.</i>

409
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,600
<i>Senior Beauty is too lacking in fortitude, really lacking.</i>

410
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,230
<i>He is with Yugong's crowd. How can he handle himself with such poor endurance?</i>

411
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,670
<i>Third Sister-in-Law, Third Brother just passed by behind me,</i>

412
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,240
<i>exactly when you said you had people confessing to you all of your life.</i>

413
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,120
<i> No way! He said he was busy and couldn't be online tonight. </i>

414
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,330
<i>He just got back.</i>

415
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,660
<i>He's turning on his laptop right now.</i>

416
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,660
<i>Good thing I got away quickly.</i>

417
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,410
<i>Wait! Why did I log off?</i>

418
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,590
<i>I was only joking.</i>

419
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,070
<i>It would make me look guilty if I left suddenly.</i>

420
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,640
<i>That won't do. I have to be open and honest.</i>

421
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,560
<i>But if I can't, then I have to act even more so...</i>

422
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,460
<i> I got disconnected just now.</i>

423
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,570
Third Brother, your wife is a genius.

424
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,950
Thank you.

425
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,680
<i>It's true that the campus network isn't very stable.</i>

426
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,810
<i>Master has a great memory. He won't remember what I said forever, right?</i>

427
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,320
<i> This won't do. There's a saying.</i>

428
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,570
<i>"Offense is the best defense."</i>

429
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,450
<i> I heard that someone called you today and confessed.</i>

430
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,720
<i> The only call I got today was to ask me to perform the guzheng at the graduation party. </i>
<i>(Note: Guzheng is a music instrument similar to zither)</i>

431
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,530
<i>Yugong is calling me to help wash his back! I'm off!</i>

432
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,260
<i> Senior Mr. Beauty, you can't fake an excuse like that! </i>

433
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,890
<i> You're leaving me high and dry here.</i>

434
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,590
<i>Please don't worry, ma'am. All of my life, no one has ever confessed to me. </i>

435
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,350
<i> It's fine if no one's ever confessed to you... </i>

436
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,510
<i> but must you stress "all of my life?" </i>

437
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,370
<i>Master must be doing this on purpose.</i>

438
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:14,260
<i>Wait! Did he say that no one has ever confessed to him?</i>

439
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,280
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

440
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,900
<i>I've witnessed someone confessing to you.</i>

441
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,740
<i>When?</i>

442
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,220
<i>This semester. Once I walked by our dorm,</i>

443
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,140
<i>I saw someone hand you a love letter.</i>

444
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,780
<i>I sort of remember.</i>

445
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,910
<i> See! And you say you've never received a confession?</i>

446
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,070
<i>I think that girl was passing out flyers.</i>

447
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,430
<i>No way...</i>

448
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,370
<i>Why not? Why would someone confess on a busy street?</i>

449
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,100
<i>Or perhaps you've been in that situation before?</i>

450
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,890
<i>Madam certainly is very popular.</i>

451
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,630
<i>Not at all. These kind of things are very bothersome when it happens often.</i>

452
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,930
<i>No! What I meant was that for this kind of event, quality is more useful than quantity.</i>

453
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,950
<i>You already have me. That should be enough.</i>

454
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,950
Third Brother, are you going out to give our beautiful Ms. Bei a call?

455
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,110
What's going on?

456
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,210
Third Brother didn't deny it!

457
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,750
Now, I am already able to completely read and understand his inner thoughts. Don't you really admire me?

458
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,230
Please. Third Brother is wearing his heart on his sleeve.

459
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,590
It's just strange to see it.

460
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,460
What is Third Brother usually like? Cold as ice.

461
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,790
No expression on his face.

462
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,980
Second Brother got it right.

463
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,460
<i>I was wrong. I shouldn't follow bad examples.</i>

464
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,550
<i>Why did I imitate Yugong and his crowd to show off? How will I be able to look Master in the face today?</i>

465
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,550
<i>No. Before Master comes to see me tomorrow,</i>

466
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,680
<i>I have to run away.</i>

467
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,730
Hello?

468
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,570
It's me.

469
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,620
Did you log off, too?

470
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,480
No, not logging off.

471
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,550
The school's internet is flaky today. I lost my connection, too.

472
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,570
<i>Master, if you don't tease me a few times each day, </i>

473
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,240
<i>you won't be able to fall asleep. Right?</i>

474
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,100
Weiwei,

475
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,820
I'm really happy.

476
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,750
<i>Is Master saying he's happy because of what I said?</i>

477
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,320
That, um, about the video contract,

478
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,960
what I asked of the gaming company were Majestic Beasts.

479
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,190
Hao Mei has already told me.

480
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,220
I asked for five. When it's convenient for you, I'll give yours to you.

481
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,180
<i>Okay.</i>

482
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,270
I wanted a little tiger for myself.

483
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,150
Yours is also a little tiger,

484
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,950
but it is of a different gender.

485
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,800
So...

486
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,820
So, we'll raise them and let them breed.

487
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,970
Maybe they could bread some baby Class-6 Majestic Beasts.

488
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,830
Okay.

489
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,970
Next time, I'll ask my tiger whether it is willing or not.

490
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,920
Do you have to ask that? In the entire game,

491
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,850
there's only one female tiger. He wouldn't dare not to agree.

492
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,020
That's reasonable.

493
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,310
Of course, he'll agree.

494
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,850
Do you have time now?

495
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,900
Huh?

496
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,960
Can you log onto the game and help my friend kill a monster?

497
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,670
Okay.

498
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,810
Then, bye-bye.

499
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,010
<i>Weiwei, why did you log off?</i>

500
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,250
<i>I think I lost my connection.</i>

501
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,320
<i>I thought you'd stood me up.</i>

502
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,180
<i>No, no, no. How many positions do you have there?</i>

503
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,010
<i>I'm bringing an expert along.</i>

504
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,820
<i>I haven't called anyone yet. You and your friend can come over.</i>

505
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,880
<i>I'm here. I just got rid of a group of spectators.</i>

506
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,750
<i>Yixiao Naihe is helping me kill a monster!</i>

507
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,400
<i>It's fun to kill monsters with him. Just let him show the way.</i>

508
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,970
<i>- I have never fought the underworld monsters before. What about you, Naihe?
- Neither have I.</i>

509
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,440
<i>Then let me check on its official website.</i>

510
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,630
<i>No need to check. We should get someone with a specialty in a ranged weapon.</i>

511
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,480
<i>Killing the boss will be faster.</i>

512
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,220
<i>Okay, I'll recruit some people from my guild. Some will definitely want to join this.</i>

513
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,460
<i>Anyone interested in fighting Underworld Ghostly Hag? Two spots. One for an archer, and the other can be anything.</i>

514
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,920
<i>Two spots? Yaoyao and I will come over. Wait for us.</i>

515
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,610
