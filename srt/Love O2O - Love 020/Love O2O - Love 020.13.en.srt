<i>♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫</i>

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,570
<i>♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫</i>

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,660
<i>♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫</i>

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,540
<i>♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫</i>

<i>♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫</i>

<i>♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫</i>

<i>♫ So this is what love looks like ♫</i>

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,970
<i>♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫</i>

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,070
<i>♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫</i>

<i>[Episode 13]</i>

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,210
<i>We should get someone with a specialty in ranged weapons.</i>

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,320
<i>Killing the boss will be faster.</i>

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,050
<i>Okay, I'll recruit some people from my guild. Some will definitely want to join this.</i>

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,900
<i>Anyone interested in fighting Underworld Ghostly Hag? Two spots.</i>

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,600
<i>One ranged, and the other can be anything.</i>

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,050
<i>Two spots? Yaoyao and I will come over. Wait for us.</i>

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,310
<i>The weather is really terrible today.</i>

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,550
<i>Let's call it a day.</i>

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,970
No, no, no...

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,580
<i>What is today? We don't do killing.</i>

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,720
<i>That is not good, either.</i>

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,370
<i>My stomach hurts! I really need to go to the bathroom.</i>

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,830
<i>Why doesn't the power go out now?</i>

39
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,190
<i>Nope, I have to say something.</i>

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>How else could we break the ice in this situation?</i>

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,330
<i>- Does anyone want out?
<i>- Leishen Nini is in our guild.</i></i>

42
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,440
<i>Why should we leave? If someone needs to go,</i>

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,910
<i> Yixiao Naihe and she should leave.</i>

44
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,650
<i>Let's just team up.</i>

45
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,020
The Underworld Cave is a six-layer tree hollow.

46
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,170
The boss of the Underworld Cave is Underworld Ghostly Hag, with her pet beaus.

47
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,710
The first challenge is easier. "Nie Xiaoqian Calling for Help" is a test of our caliber.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,060
The next four challenges are manned by her pet beaus.

49
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,160
Once we fight off her pet beaus, we will reach Underworld Ghostly Hag in the last challenge.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,290
In the last challenge, Underworld Ghostly Hag and her pet beaus from the previous challenges

51
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,090
will fight together.

52
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,920
I was once a reputable woman, but I was abducted by the Underworld Ghostly Hag to this cave

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,900
and forced to seduce those young men for her enjoyment.

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,240
Today, a group of you heroes has come to rescue me, Xiaoqian.

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,900
I feel so grateful in my heart,

56
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,700
but I have to test your skills in martial arts,

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,230
in case you lose to the Ghostly Hag

58
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,300
and die in vain for me.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,940
Help, Zhenshui!

60
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,950
Hide yourself first.

61
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,560
With your stellar skills,

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,210
I'm sure you can beat the Underworld Ghostly Hag and rescue innocent people like me.

63
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,430
I'll lead the way.

64
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,510
Help!

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,210
Help!

66
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,540
Zhenshui, I was so scared!

67
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,000
Why are all the monsters after me?

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,260
- Stay close to me next time.
- Okay.

69
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,660
Zhenshui, you're amazing. You save me every time.

70
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,560
What is with Yaoyao running all the time? That's awful!

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
Running around everywhere and attracting monsters.

72
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
If it weren't for you and Naihe, our team would have been crushed earlier.

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,200
It's fine. We'll take care of them all the same.

74
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,680
I wonder if we can pass the last challenge today.

75
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,010
Don't worry. Naihe is here, isn't he?

76
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,680
Am I right?

77
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,370
Weiwei, I don't envy them at all.

78
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,570
I envy you and Naihe.

79
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,580
That proves that you have good judgment.

80
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,780
I have no reply to that.

81
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,750
We're about to reach the last challenge. Be careful, everyone.

82
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,160
This Underground Ghostly Hag is really creepy.

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,730
If a female player dies, the system announces the player died in the battle.

84
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,610
If a male player dies,

85
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,510
the player is announced to have become a pet beau for Underground Ghostly Hag.

86
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,690
So, our two male players should watch out.

87
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,400
Everyone, straight ahead is the Underworld Ghostly Hag's lair.

88
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,690
That place is full of traps. I'm scared of going there.

89
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,260
You can go ahead without me.

90
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,020
I'll be leaving now.

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,560
The last challenge will be to fight the old hag. Who will be in command?

92
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,300
Usually, the player with the highest grade commands the team.

93
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,310
Anything you wish. The difficulty of this mission is only average.

94
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,270
<i>Master is so calculating. Zhenshui was going to take charge,</i>

95
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,130
<i>but after what Master said, it'd be hard for Zhenshui to give orders.</i>

96
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,270
<i>Otherwise, it'd seem that he's taking advantage of Master.</i>

97
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,550
Since the difficulty is average, I'll do it.

98
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,810
Another pretty face has arrived?

99
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,190
Let me have a good taste of you then!

100
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,360
She is indeed creepy.

101
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,580
Is a little vamp leading the group?

102
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,850
Don't you know that I like male flesh?

103
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,460
I'll show you what Underworld Ghostly Hag is about!

104
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,150
<i>Why did she release monsters without warning? I wasn't ready.</i>

105
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,880
When a female player leads, the hostility index goes up, and the monsters will attack without provocation.

106
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,890
That's right. I forgot to tell you.

107
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,210
No problem. I'm used to this creepy game.

108
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,620
Xiaoyu Yaoyao, increase your blood points first.

109
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,060
All of my magic has gone dark. Give me blood, fast!

110
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,850
Naihe!

111
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,820
A healer should focus on dodging the attack. Once hit, you can't help others.

112
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,160
Counterattack after retreat.

113
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,140
Why target me only?

114
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,860
Use Yang to strengthen Yin!
<i>(Note: Yin and Yang are two and opposite forces in nature in Chinese philosophy)</i>

115
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,310
Take care of the nimble pet beau. He's so annoying.

116
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,950
- Take charge.
- Okay.

117
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,980
Why? Take out the little monster first. We'll take them down one at a time.

118
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,520
In a rescue mission, the reward is directly proportional to the number of survivors.

119
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,570
The pet beaus were lured here by Underworld Ghostly Hag.

120
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,920
Since we are rescuing them, we can't kill them.

121
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,750
- Archer!
- Got it!

122
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,460
You two work pretty well together.

123
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,390
That's great! We are about to get past this challenge.

124
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,910
<i>If I attack the Boss with my major weapon,</i>

125
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,160
<i>it might be too late to resurrect Zhenshui Wuxiang and Xiaoyu Yaoyao.</i>

126
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,390
Awesome! Weiwei, your Master is so cool!

127
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,530
<i>How did he do it in such a short amount of time? He even brought Zhenshui and Yaoyao back to life!</i>

128
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,730
<i>He's so magnanimous. He's such a man!</i>

129
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,030
<i>Nini, we're leaving. Chat me if you need me.</i>

130
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,260
<i>If I'm not around, you can directly chat Naihe.</i>

131
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,740
<i>What? Can I?</i>

132
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,620
<i>Yes.</i>

133
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,320
<i>Okay, we're leaving.</i>

134
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,760
<i>Oh, wait a second. We haven't divided up the spoils yet.</i>

135
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,270
<i>No need.</i>

136
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,720
<i>Why did you save Zhenshui and Xiaoyu at the end?</i>

137
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,650
<i>Don't you think they would feel even worse after I saved them?</i>

138
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,740
<i>Okay, you convinced me.</i>

139
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>What shall we do next?</i>

140
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,300
<i>Wait a minute. The phone is ringing.</i>

141
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,940
<i>The phone?</i>

142
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,160
<i>Do you mean while we were fighting the boss,</i>

143
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,610
<i>you were on a call?</i>

144
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,010
<i>Yes.</i>

145
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,470
<i>How did you do it with one hand?</i>

146
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,880
<i>By using earphones.</i>

147
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,870
<i>You're right! You can answer a call by using earphones.</i>

148
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,350
<i>I'm so dumb.</i>

149
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,650
<i>Then go ahead and take your call.</i>

150
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,250
<i>He can even multitask while making a call and attack so formidably.</i>

151
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,430
<i>Master's skills are at a high level that defies nature!</i>

152
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,530
Okay, I understand.

153
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,520
See you the day after tomorrow.

154
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,970
<i>Right! I have to finish Master's present.</i>

155
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,290
<i>I hope it turns out to be the best.</i>

156
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,980
<i>The time has come to test my luck.</i>

157
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,380
<i>Weiwei.</i>

158
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,050
<i>Is your call over?</i>

159
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,250
<i>Yes. The day after tomorrow, I have to go on a business trip.</i>

160
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,920
Look at this.

161
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,670
It seems that the department beauty queen came by.

162
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,700
Tell me. If we let Ah Shuang know

163
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,110
our pure males-only holy ground was stained by our Third Sister-in-Law,

164
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,080
would he not be able to program?

165
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,920
He has to. I'll tell you guys. I'll tell him later.

166
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,640
That guy is the one who's keeping us single.

167
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,950
Third Brother.

168
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,970
Zhen Yi's people haven't contacted me again.

169
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,220
Do you think he knows I've given my heart to you?

170
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,710
Hey, Brother. If you don't know how to use idioms, can we just not use them?

171
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,250
I really wonder how you got into Tsinghua University.

172
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,160
Of course, I relied on this.

173
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,560
Zhen Yi hasn't done any follow-up because Feng Teng has gotten involved.

174
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,420
Huh? They backed off so easily.

175
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,760
How boring! I was really looking forward to seeing what Third Brother would do to Zhen Yi.

176
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,840
Feng Teng actually gave us good feedback on the mobile game.

177
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,150
After I see them tomorrow, we should have definite news.

178
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,930
So our focus is to win the development rights to A New Chinese Ghost Story.

179
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,490
Third Sister-in-Law sold the video

180
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,370
to get magical beasts for us. Feng Teng seems to be really interested in that concept.

181
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,440
If we use that when we talk to them, wouldn't it work even better?

182
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,630
That's not the deciding innovation. It won't influence Feng Teng's decision.

183
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,420
This feature of kidnapping bride/bridegroom can be designed to be interesting and complex.

184
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,980
This needs a bigger game engine to support it. It will further underscore our advantage.

185
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,990
We're not yet ready. Zhen Yi is.

186
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,070
Of course, it will also make Weiwei happy.

187
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,100
Oh my God! Now, I think I understand.

188
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,350
So, that's the main reason.

189
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,060
This time when you go to Feng Teng,

190
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,350
you have to get the development rights to "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

191
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,660
At any cost.

192
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,920
Okay, CEO Zhen. Please don't worry. Our research and development capability is well-known.

193
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,670
I'm 100% sure we can get this project.

194
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,650
But I've heard that Zhi Yi Technology is also interested in this project.

195
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,300
- What? Those young kids?
- Yes, that's right.

196
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,430
Don't they think too highly of themselves?

197
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,980
How about this? To be on the safe side, I'll go with you this time.

198
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,330
Hurry and get a present ready and deliver it to Feng Teng's Director Wang.

199
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,540
It won't be a problem if we privately increase our kickback.

200
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,310
Okay.

201
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,880
On this project, making money is secondary. The key is

202
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,930
to leverage the channels of Feng Teng Technology to upgrade our presence in the industry,

203
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,700
and expand the influence of the company.

204
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,100
I think when our collaboration is announced, the stock price of our company will go up.

205
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,460
When that happens, we get everything back.

206
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,570
Okay, CEO Zhen.

207
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,540
Zhen Shaoxiang!

208
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,120
I brought you to the company to learn,

209
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,010
not to play with your phone. Look at you!

210
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,150
You're not even as mature as your cousin!

211
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,140
I've been listening! Isn't it just the development of the new version of "A Chinese Ghost Story?"

212
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,180
If the company can get this project, it'll increase our influence. If our stock price increases, it'll reduce our losses.

213
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,970
What's not to understand?

214
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,730
Look at you saying nonsense! Tomorrow, you'll come with me.

215
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,140
Tomorrow night, Feng Teng has a very important wine reception. All the bigwigs from different industries will be there.

216
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,530
You have to come with me and meet people.

217
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,430
Dad, I have exams tomorrow. Let's talk about it next time.

218
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,590
I really don't understand Xiao Nai. Isn't Yiran better than Bei Weiwei?

219
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,900
Talented and good-looking, also she already met Xiao Nai earlier.

220
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,140
This isn't an issue about who met him first. Yiran is just too pure.

221
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,060
She doesn't have as many tricks as Bei Weiwei.

222
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,890
You have been led astray by your roommate

223
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,100
and took too many detours.

224
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,700
Then can I still return to the right path?

225
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,920
You can. However, you won't need to take the initiative.

226
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,630
Instead, use your personality and beauty

227
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,080
to make him chase you of his own will. This is the right path.

228
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,370
The things your roommate said about chasing after another before,

229
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,750
those are too plebeian and don't suit you at all.

230
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,890
You have to be clear about your own position. You're a refined and desirable lady.

231
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,300
You're not a common girl like Bei Weiwei.

232
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,130
That's logical, Yiran. It would be good to listen to Aixiang Nai'er's suggestion.

233
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,570
Go to Feng Teng's wine reception.

234
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,960
Take advantage of all the possible opportunities during which you can meet Xiao Nai.

235
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,640
Remember. Be yourself. Demonstrate your excellence.

236
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,240
By all means, do not take the initiative. He will notice you.

237
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,890
With a flight at 9:00 a.m, you still came to school for breakfast.

238
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,200
It's already 7:00 a.m. right now!

239
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,910
The breakfast at school is tasty.

240
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,610
But... you're going to graduate.

241
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,930
You won't be able to eat it in the future. Your food card will be confiscated.

242
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,560
There's still yours.

243
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,400
And what if I don't lend it to you?

244
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,460
Then I can only leech off the elders.

245
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,230
My parents' cards.

246
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,960
You can act so natural even for leeching off elders.

247
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,680
Today, I have Professor Xiao's class.

248
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,210
It's the last one of this semester.

249
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,490
Well... does he know about us?

250
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,890
Oh.

251
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,330
What is "oh" supposed to mean?

252
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,530
Does it mean he knows or not?

253
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,230
Today, we're handing in our thesis paper. Will he come?

254
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,570
Originally, he wasn't going to. Now, he will.

255
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,030
That means he knows.

256
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,580
If I knew earlier, I would have asked you to look over my thesis.

257
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,820
Will a poorly written thesis paper deduct points from his impression of me?

258
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,930
In actuality, this situation is really simple. You don't need to be this nervous.

259
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,040
How is it?

260
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,690
All you have to do is...

261
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,370
pretend not to know him.

262
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,900
You saw that girl, right? How was it?

263
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,790
Extremely good.

264
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,660
This is the thesis paper she wrote. You can have a look.

265
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,760
Her handwriting is pretty good.

266
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,560
Also, her logic is extremely well-knit.

267
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,000
She's probably pretty smart.

268
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,920
I think she's pretty good.

269
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,250
Their department's dean is just next door to us.

270
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,410
He's particularly strict toward the females in his department.

271
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,620
Even he said she's not bad, so there's no way she could be bad.

272
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,920
I say, Xiao Nai, this rascal,

273
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,430
last time, I wondered why he suddenly came to listen to my lecture.

274
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,330
He sat beside this girl.

275
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,140
Our son isn't like you or me.

276
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,760
Back then, when you were interested in me,

277
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,450
you held it in for five or six years before you said anything.

278
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,440
What do you mean, I was interested in you?

279
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,010
Clearly, you were interested in me. Okay?

280
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,960
Holding it in for five or six years...

281
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,920
Ah, no! Eight or nine years!

282
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,430
I only took the initiative to tell you when I was worried you couldn't bear holding it anymore.

283
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,090
Now, you're putting feathers in your own cap.
<i>(Note: literally says "sticking gold on your face")</i>

284
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,730
Back then, if I didn't accept, you would have cried!

285
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,350
Why are you speaking nonsense?

286
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,490
Do you have evidence?

287
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,800
Enough, enough. It's ancient history. Let's not discuss it. Hey,

288
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,610
say, in the end, who is our son like?

289
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,240
Having a girlfriend as soon as he graduates from college...

290
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,870
In any case, he's not like either one of us.

291
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,720
Probably, the two of us...

292
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,500
two negatives equal a positive?

293
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,530
It should be like this.

294
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,750
So sorry.

295
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,060
Our Master isn't here to eat with us, but you don't have to sigh. Right?

296
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,440
I haven't! I was thinking

297
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,170
there are so many people. Once it gets to us, what dishes will be left?

298
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,870
Weiwei, how far have you and Master gotten?

299
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,760
- Meeting the parents.
- Huh?!

300
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,230
That quick?

301
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,430
I was just kidding!

302
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,920
We've only known each other for a week. How could it go that fast?

303
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,340
I meant that today, I just finished attending Professor Xiao's class.

304
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,770
You two decided to go steady after meeting each other for a couple of hours.

305
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,800
Based on this pace, meeting the parents after a week isn't odd.

306
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,980
We haven't met the parents!

307
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,490
We really haven't! Why would I joke about that with you all?

308
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,440
It's impossible, right? Could it be that Master Xiao changed strategies and slowed his steps?

309
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,250
Is he planning to cook the frog from heating the water gradually?
<i>(Note: So she doesn't sense the danger and run)</i>

310
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,340
He definitely wants to play the long game with Weiwei.

311
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,010
How romantic!

312
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,160
- You're the one who's a frog.
- Come on, that has to be it.

313
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,750
First, boil at high heat; then, simmer at low heat.

314
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,210
Sooner or later, he'll devour you as his frog.

315
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,540
I reckon Master's battle strategy is like this:

316
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,230
First, a round of blitzkrieg warfare, now playing a round with infiltration tactics.

317
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,910
Weiwei, when will you be able to wage a war of attrition?

318
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,070
Yes. First up, is a gale with a downpour so you lose your sense of direction.

319
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,350
Next, comes the soothing breeze with fine drizzle to make you dizzy and disorientated.

320
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,100
Finally, what kind of rain will come next?

321
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,420
<i>A passionate storm?</i>

322
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:06,020
A prolonged battle, prolonged battle. Prolonged. Prolonged. Prolonged.

323
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,170
Third Sister-in-Law... I'm Mo Zhata.

324
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,950
- Mo Zhata?
- That's right. It's me, it's me.

325
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,950
<i>No way. Then just now, what we were talking about,</i>

326
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,600
<i>he heard all of it.</i>

327
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,280
<i>So embarrassing!</i>

328
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,550
<i>Also, didn't he say he was darker than a lump of coal?</i>

329
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,220
- So it's Mr. Beauty Senior.
- No...

330
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,290
Nice to meet you.

331
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,170
It's time again for Xiao Ling's Talk Show.

332
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,020
He said, "Mulan, I like you." "How did you know I was a woman?"

333
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,350
"What? It turns out you're a woman?"

334
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,080
Is that so funny?

335
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,900
Tell one that Si Si can understand, okay?

336
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,500
<i>Your wife is trying to seduce me.</i>

337
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,250
<i>Be seduced in obedience. I don't mind.</i>

338
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,230
This really is a case of "One leads and the other follows."

339
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,250
Just wait for me to take my revenge.

340
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,590
I thought you had come because of the mobile game.

341
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,390
I didn't realize that this was a case of "Xiang Zhuang's brandishing his sword dance is intended for Liu Liu Bei's assassination."
<i>(Note: the idiom refers to the concealed intent of an act)</i>

342
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,910
Do you guys also have an interest in the development of "A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

343
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,510
At present, mobile games still have many limitations in terms of gameplay and visuals.

344
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,730
We're naturally not going to be limited to mobile games.

345
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,970
Our engine is also made to support the client-server platforms.

346
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,460
We at Feng Teng Technologies have adjusted our strategy.

347
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,670
The core team for "A Chinese Ghost Story" has already been transferred to other new markets.

348
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,260
Only some maintenance personnel remain. Originally, we didn't intend to develop a new release of "A Chinese Ghost Story,"

349
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,130
however, the players really want us to release a new edition.

350
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,560
In terms of "A New Chinese Ghost Story," we'd rather go without than accept a shoddy product.

351
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,850
Since your engine is already very mature,

352
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,250
I hope you can give a demo that shows your technical ability within three months.

353
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,080
Also, give a more detailed project plan and development schedule, as well as your financial budget.

354
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,410
This isn't considered too demanding for you, right?

355
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,750
In such a sort period of time, it's fairly demanding.

356
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,750
However, we are willing to accept the challenge.

357
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,920
Good! Then we'll look forward to it.

358
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,480
In terms of the mobile game, I'd like Feng Teng to be the sole operator.

359
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,320
If possible, we'd like an additional five percent to the revenue sharing.

360
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,520
I hope you'll consider it.

361
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,740
I have a lot of confidence in Feng Teng's channels,

362
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,130
but appreciate even more the openness in Feng Teng's attitude about collaboration.

363
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,700
This allows every partner

364
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,010
to identify the collaboration format most suitable for himself.

365
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,660
I understand what you mean.

366
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,870
However, what if we also include Feng Teng's S+ rated capability in

367
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,990
its marketing resources?

368
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,350
One year of exclusive distribution.

369
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,860
The maximum lifespan of a mobile game is a year.

370
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,690
This term of yours is rather meaningless.

371
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,910
I have confidence in the lifespan

372
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,760
of our product.

373
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,900
Okay.

374
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,190
Then it's settled.

375
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,470
I'll arrange the contract signing as soon as possible.

376
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,160
It's getting pretty late. The wine reception is starting soon.

377
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Let's get going.

378
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,160
I'll introduce you to our CEO Feng.

379
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,230
Thank you, Director Wang.

380
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,600
Please.

381
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,500
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, our junior sister, Weiwei.</i>

382
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,530
Since it's not a call from Third Brother, you're probably terribly disappointed. Right?

383
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,470
- You're right. I'm very disappointed. I'm hanging up.
<i>- Hey!</i>

384
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,170
<i>No, no, no!</i>

385
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,360
Junior sister, th-th-that is,

386
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,020
come online and send us the Majestic Beasts.

387
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,720
I can't right now. Wait until I... finish studying.

388
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,340
- Besides, you guys bothering a student studying for exams is immoral.
- Hey!

389
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,250
Junior Sister Weiwei, once Third Brother comes back, make him study with you.

390
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,040
He is helping me study already.

391
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,210
Th-Th-Then that's good.

392
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,370
Rubbed our nose in their relationship again!

393
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,230
<i>Junior Sister Weiwei, let's do this.</i>

394
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,580
We'll wish you a successful study and not bother you again.

395
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,470
Remember to send us the Majestic Beasts.

396
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,420
Okay. Then you guys wait in our house.

397
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,150
<i>I wonder how Master's business negotiation is going.</i>

398
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,340
<i>Don't think about it. Concentrate on studying.</i>

399
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,300
Yes, speak.

400
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,880
Very well.

401
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,510
Okay, I understand.

402
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,770
<i>Your wife is bullying me.</i>

403
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,590
<i>It seems while I'm gone,</i>

404
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,340
<i>you guys are really having fun.</i>

405
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,310
All right, I understand.

406
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,290
I just received news that

407
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,860
CEO Zhen of Zhen Yi Technologies is also coming to the wine reception.

408
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,750
They also appear determined to get the "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

409
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:08,140
I heard that there were some misunderstandings between you guys and CEO Zhen.

410
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,430
We're all in the same industry. CEO Zhen is our senior.

411
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,780
I'm honored to have the chance to interact with him.

412
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,610
That's good. Young people with good manners.

413
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,480
Miss Meng, I've already arranged your outfits.

414
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,900
If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to call us.

415
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,710
Yiran, hurry up.

416
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,120
I know. Give me another fifteen minutes.

417
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,730
CEO Zhen, it's about time.

418
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,270
Yiran, we're going down first.

419
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,260
Later, come down yourself.

420
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,090
The third-floor ballroom, okay?

421
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,900
I know, Uncle. You guys go ahead.

422
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,120
CEO Xiao, let me introduce you guys.

423
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,800
This is Director He of Feng Teng Technologies, who is in charge of "A Chinese Ghost Story," Xiao He.

424
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,060
This is CEO Xiao of Zhi Yi Technology, Xiao Nai.

425
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,830
- Director He.
- CEO Xiao.

426
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,270
The new mobile game we acquired was developed by their team.

427
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,420
In the future, you two can have some productive exchange.

428
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,150
Also, let me tell you. CEO Xiao intends to compete for the development of "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

429
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,350
Oh?

430
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,840
CEO Xiao is so young. You remind me of myself several years ago.

431
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,630
Our Director Wang really likes to promote young people.

432
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:01,620
Yesterday, I spoke with that Director Wang. The situation is somewhat worrisome.

433
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,150
That fellow doesn't seem to know how to be very flexible.

434
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,750
Many things are not decided by him alone.

435
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,090
The original project manager is very important.

436
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,420
Try to find the rest of the people.

437
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,720
Okay. Then in a bit, I'll chat up Director He later.

438
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,640
No need to wait. We'll go over there now.

439
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,750
Director Wang, Director He.

440
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,780
Wow, CEO Zhen, when did you get here?

441
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,340
I didn't see you when I just came in.

442
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,730
Director Wang, you have discerning eyes.

443
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,220
You noticed that I was a little bit late.

444
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,760
Isn't this CEO Xiao from Zhi Yi?

445
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,200
How unexpected! What a coincidence meeting you here.

446
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,380
I heard you've already reached an agreement to collaborate with Director Wang on your mobile game.

447
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,730
CEO Zhen, you are very quick in getting the word.

448
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,330
With this collaboration, the situation has quickly changed from before.

449
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:21,340
You're no longer the team that can be bought for ¥3,000,000.
<i>(Note: Approx. 450,000 USD)</i>

450
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,620
¥3,000,000?

451
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,490
CEO Zhen is known in this industry for making bold moves.

452
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,400
We were young, inexperienced, and scared away by his offer.

453
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,850
We were afraid of not living up to his expectation, so we didn't get to partner with him.

454
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,120
- Mr. Wharton, nice to meet you.
- <i>Oh, Mr. Feng.</i>

455
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,490
Xiao He, play host for a bit.

456
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,320
I'll take CEO Xiao to meet our CEO Feng.

457
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,760
Please.

458
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,040
- Excuse me.

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,930
CEO Feng, this is the person I've mentioned to you,

460
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,130
CEO Xiao of Zhi Yi Technology, Xiao Nai.

461
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,260
He is a brilliant student from the Computer Science Department of Tsinghua University.

462
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,780
CEO Xiao, our CEO Feng.

463
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,460
CEO Feng, I'm pleased to meet you.

464
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,960
CEO Xiao is much younger than I imagined.

465
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,820
That's right. Actually, I had been worried that CEO Xiao might be too young.

466
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,560
I never thought that, whether it be the mobile game or the planning for "A New Chinese Ghost Story,"

467
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,410
they all greatly impress me.

468
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,140
Moreover, CEO Xiao also has extensive knowledge with system security.

469
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,590
Does this mean that CEO Xiao is also interested in the development of "A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

470
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,070
"A Chinese Ghost Story" is a superb game.

471
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:40,330
I hope to make my own mark on the foundation of its predecessors.

472
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,350
My wife also plays this game, so she pays a lot of attention to this project.

473
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,060
Recently, there have been a few proposals which I found lacking.

474
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,200
I look forward to your giving me a fresh perspective.

475
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,650
I won't let you down.

476
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,450
Then, I'll look forward to it.
