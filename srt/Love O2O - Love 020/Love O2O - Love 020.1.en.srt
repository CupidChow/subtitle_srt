Luwei Weiwei, be careful.

28
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,660
Zhenshui, I'll aggro him up later. As usual, find an opportunity to ambush him.
<i>(Note: aggro means getting the gaming character's attention for battle)</i>

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,110
Okay!

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,470
Hurry up. Keep up!

31
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,470
Wow! The Magical Heaven Reversal Necklace?

32
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,090
Nini, your equipment.

33
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,010
I'm so lucky today.

34
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,840
The Magical Heaven Reversal Necklace?

35
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,360
Luwei Weiwei, interested in a duel?

36
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,610
Sure.

37
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,280
There should be some prize for a duel, right?

38
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,760
We'll use that necklace the Boss dropped as the stakes. What do you say?

39
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,650
So you have your eye on the necklace.

40
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,990
It's not mine though.

41
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,050
Then I'll battle you.

42
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,030
You are among the top ten players on this server. If I battle you, I'll lose without a doubt.

43
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,550
You can have Luwei Weiwei fight in your place.

44
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,420
If I lose, I'll give you the Magical Heaven Reversal Ring.

45
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,320
Do you dare?

46
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,900
Weiwei?

47
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,510
- Okay.
- Good. See you at 5:00 p.m. at the tavern outside of Jinling City.

48
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,810
Zhenshui, what do you want to see me for?

49
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,850
Are there monsters in this area?

50
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,120
Weiwei, it's been more than six months since we became a couple.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,430
Yet you're still calling me Zhenshui. Isn't it a bit awkward?

52
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,380
Does it seem even more awkward if I call you Wuxiang?

53
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,680
Honey, today's task are 12 Three-Eyed Monkeys. Help me kill them.

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,810
Sweetie, just stand by and watch. I'll take care of them.

55
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,360
Okay!

56
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,620
Weiwei, are you going to college in the capital city?

57
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,200
<i>I'm also based in the capital city. Should we meet up? I'll treat you to dinner.</i>

58
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,990
<i>I know of a really good Japanese restaurant. It's as good as those Three-Star Michelin restaurants in Japan.</i>

59
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,080
<i>That's not necessary. Let's just have fun playing the game.</i>

60
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,310
<i>There's a saying now that you never know whether it's a person or a dog playing the game with you.</i>

61
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,180
<i>I just want to make sure.</i>

62
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,770
<i>I want... to see what you look like.</i>

63
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,920
<i>Could you show me your picture?</i>

64
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,010
<i>Professor Yu's class is just so good.</i>

65
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,010
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello to you all.

66
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,820
Weiwei, nobody's around. Hurry up!

67
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,140
What's going on? Why did the electricity go out all of a sudden?

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,460
The circuit seems to have blown out.

69
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,660
I was just cooking noodles and it got blown out?

70
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,670
Will Auntie (<i>the dorm supervisor</i>) yell at us?

71
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,490
Sister, couldn't you have calculated the amount of current required before cooking?

72
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,530
Come on, Dear. I major in Computer Science, not Electrical Engineering.

73
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,100
What do I do? My noodles aren't done yet.

74
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,810
What's this about what to do? Share half the noodles with me.

75
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,710
All right.

76
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,490
You're awesome!

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,360
No wonder the girls in science and engineering have such a hard time getting married.

78
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,050
If we can handle all electrical work ourselves, what do we need guys for?

79
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,850
First of all, I did handle the electrical work,

80
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,040
but it has nothing to do with your problem in finding a boyfriend.

81
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,000
Secondly, Miss Erxi, my online friend just asked me for a picture.

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,720
I just suddenly disappeared. He must have thought I have something to hide.

83
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,990
How are you going to compensate me for the damage to my reputation?

84
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,310
Do you mean Zhenshui Wuxiang, your partner in the game?

85
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,170
Wow, Bei Weiwei!

86
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,810
Stop right there!

87
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,240
How do you know that so clearly?

88
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,730
Were you peeping on me while I was playing?

89
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,930
Don't worry about the details.

90
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,820
- So, are you going to show him a picture?
- Of course not.

91
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,920
We only became a couple so we could tackle territorial quests.

92
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,370
It'd be really weird to show my picture.

93
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,630
However, it's not very nice to immediately log off.

94
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,850
At the very least, I have to find an excuse.

95
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,760
For example, something like "my computer is broken" or "I lost all my pictures."

96
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,280
No way.

97
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,970
Your laptop's not working and all your photos are gone?

98
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,310
You jinxed me.

99
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,150
Why is this not working?

100
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,130
Weiwei, I forgot to tell you that

101
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,350
when I borrowed your laptop yesterday,

102
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,460
I accidentally dropped it.

103
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,560
Where are you running off to? Where are you running off to? Come back here!

104
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,450
Just what happened? You'd better explain.

105
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,100
- Let's go.
- Let me finish eating my noodles first!

106
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,860
What eating now? You broke my laptop and still in the mood to eat? No way!

107
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,420
Go!

108
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,310
It's such a nice day today.

109
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,740
Xiao Ling went to see her boyfriend. Si Si is attending a classmate gathering,

110
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,940
but I have to go with you for your computer repair.

111
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,340
This lovely spring day is going to be wasted.

112
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,120
You have the nerve to say that! Who broke my laptop? Get going!

113
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,340
Here.

114
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,120
Some new movies are coming out lately.

115
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,080
Let's go to a movie after you drop off your laptop for repair.

116
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,820
I won't leave it with the store. I plan to buy a motherboard and replace it myself.

117
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,090
It saves money and is quick. Besides, I have to use it tonight.

118
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you need it so urgently?

119
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,190
Of course. A studious and ambitious Computer Science student like me

120
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,410
cannot be away from the computer for even a day.

121
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,410
- All right?
- He he!

122
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,480
Tell the truth.

123
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,060
I have a duel tonight.

124
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,730
I knew it.

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,040
In the blink of an eye, we are sophomores already.
I never thought at Tsinghua University

126
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,870
where there is such a large disparity in number of males and females,

127
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,370
and in the Computer Science Department which has an even bigger gender imbalance, two years have passed,

128
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,030
and still no one took notice of me. It's so sad.

129
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,670
Don't tell me you chose this major for that reason.

130
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,210
Of course, that's not the only reason.

131
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,690
Tsinghua University, which has the top science and engineering programs, is definitely the college I dreamed about.

132
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,150
Computer Science is also the field of study that I like.

133
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,210
However, none of that should interfere with my marriage planning.

134
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,610
Let's go to see what that's about! Hurry!

135
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,610
What are they all looking at?

136
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,310
<i>[Campus Basketball Tournament]</i>

137
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,910
<i>[Computer Science Department versus Biochemistry Department]</i>

138
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,940
Xiao Nai is coming back to play in the basketball game!

139
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,910
That's great! We can see him play basketball again!

140
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,150
<i>It's Computer Science versus Biochemistry. Xiao Nai is the star player. We should get to see him this time.</i>

141
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,530
<i>Not necessarily. Xiao Nai is already a senior and he rarely shows up at school.</i>

142
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,430
I heard that there hasn't been any update for that mysterious post on the chat forum.

143
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,940
I think it might just be another gimmick this time.

144
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,230
Who cares? There's nothing to lose by going to take a look. Besides, this is the last time we'll get to see him in person.

145
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,470
<i>True. It breaks my heart to think of it. Why isn't he going to the graduate school?</i>

146
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,460
<i>- Exactly. It's such a shame.
- That's right.
- Hey, you all have to go later.</i>

147
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,200
We need to get there an hour early to grab seats.

148
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,890
Weiwei, I didn't realize that you'd be so smitten.

149
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,080
Of course. It's the legend. I've downloaded every piece of software he's released.

150
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,320
If the school publishes a list of ranking like in games,

151
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,690
he would be number one in all the skills.

152
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,700
Girl, you sure have substance. I only look at the face and the body.

153
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,080
I really can't understand what goes on in the brains of you geniuses.

154
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,160
By the way, just who deleted that video of his swimming meet?

155
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,110
- I really want to see it!
- Hush.

156
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,660
Yiran, let's buy this.

157
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,870
Na Na, I don't even know him.

158
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,470
How can I get him to help me?

159
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,210
Don't worry. I met someone in his dorm a couple days ago.

160
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,130
That's how I came up with this idea.

161
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,630
We just have to buy the RAM and then go to them for help.

162
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,700
I don't believe that they could have any excuse not to help once they hear your name.

163
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,910
Don't worry.

164
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,430
I've already told him. The merchandise has been shipped.

165
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,240
Just have him check, okay?

166
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,300
- Boss, how much is this?
- 500 yuan.

167
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,390
500 yuan? Is it that expensive?

168
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,600
Go ahead and ask around. It's the same price everywhere. This stuff is not the same, all right?

169
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,970
Sell it to us cheaper. How about 450 yuan?

170
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,070
Not a cent less. I'm already selling it to you at the lowest price.

171
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,250
Boss, isn't your price a bit unreasonable?

172
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,500
The contacts on your memory stick don't have the proper sheen. It's obviously a used item.

173
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,740
You're selling it as new and even twice as expensive.
Are you trying to pull a fast one on us?

174
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,870
Nonsense! What do you know? Stop meddling!

175
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm a Computer Science major. Why wouldn't I know?

176
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,190
Your shop is right outside the school, yet the way you do business is so shady.

177
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,980
Once the word gets out, it won't be good for your business.

178
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,480
That's right! You're so shady.

179
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,090
Where's the former boss? Where is he? Has there been a change of hands?

180
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,810
What former boss? It's always been me, okay?

181
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,890
What's with you two girls? Did you come here just to cause trouble?

182
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,580
You girls look so pretty and proper, but you're full of lies! Leave.

183
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,900
Classmates, the memory sticks of this brand usually only cost around 200 yuan.

184
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,600
If you don't believe me, just check online.

185
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,320
- The ones online are fake so, of course, they're cheaper.
- She seems to be Bei Weiwei.

186
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,610
Fellow schoolmates, thank you. However, I believe the store owner wouldn't lie to us.

187
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,430
And he has a business to run, so it's only fair that he should make a profit.

188
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,980
She was acting all refined and considerate! Who was she trying to impress?

189
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,420
We were helping her, but instead, we were made to be the bad guys. Here.

190
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,650
I know why! It must be because you're Bei Weiwei and she's Meng Yiran.

191
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,680
Don't tell me you don't know who Meng Yiran is? The school beauty queen.

192
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,280
- I thought she looked familiar.
- That must be it.

193
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,180
In the school beauty contest last year, the competition between you two was so fierce like a raging fire.

194
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,330
How could she not act high and noble in front of you?

195
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,410
It wasn't like a raging fire. Who was the one who submitted my photo last year?

196
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,240
You already searched my computer and cell phone last year. It wasn't me!

197
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Besides, why would I post such a blurry photo?

198
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,520
If I were really the one who took the picture, I would definitely take a high-quality photo

199
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,550
of a full-frontal shower scene!

200
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,140
Do you think Meng Yiran's photo was Photoshopped? The kind of editing that takes several days?

201
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,610
She doesn't look as good as the photo on the forum. Had she posted a real photo,

202
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,620
Weiwei, I guarantee you wouldn't have lost last year!

203
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,050
I'm going to the internet cafe later.

204
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,440
Also, I recall that she won last year. She was first, and I was second.

205
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,000
Theoretically, I should be the one feeling hostile toward her. Why would she be hostile towards me?

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,340
Who knows? Maybe...

207
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,010
her chest is flat.

208
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,040
Geez! My dear!

209
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,370
She must be.

210
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,300
I finally know why you can't get a boyfriend.

211
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,010
Why? Tell me and I'll change right away.

212
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,560
- It's obvious because you're more concerned with girls.
- Weiwei, don't think I won't hit you!

213
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,670
All right, I'll stop teasing you. Bring my laptop back with you later. Bye!

214
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,270
How could you talk about me? You're stuck to a computer all day!

215
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,480
I heard from your father that you're planning on starting your own company.

216
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,190
I do have that plan in mind.

217
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,350
In what field?

218
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,200
I'll develop two games first.

219
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,890
If you win this round, I'll give you a gift.

220
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,010
Weiwei!

221
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,430
Luwei Weiwei, I thought you were too scared to come.

222
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,230
I don't seem to be late.

223
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,160
Late or not, the outcome will be the same. Get ready to give up the necklace.

224
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,030
Let's begin.

225
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,280
Your turn.

226
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,040
Thanks for taking it easy on me.

227
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,300
Thanks for taking it easy on me.

228
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,710
<i>Geez. No wonder Luwei Weiwei is the only female player in the Player Rankings. She is such a game master.</i>

229
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,760
<i>Exactly. How can she control her jumps so well?</i>

230
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,740
<i>Those dodges were epic.</i>

231
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,930
<i>With this level of skill, how is she only ranked number six?</i>

232
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,460
<i>- I wonder who the number one is.
- Isn't he the legendary Yixiao Naihe? I don't think I've ever seen him.</i>

233
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,050
<i>That name is so pretentious. How could he choose such a username?</i>

234
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,040
<i>Luwei Weiwei, let's have another match!</i>

235
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,590
<i>Sure! But I'm now at an internet cafe and have only bought for one hour.</i>

236
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,600
<i>Let's finish this quickly, then.</i>

237
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,660
According to our agreement a moment ago,

238
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,920
you won this round, so I'm going to give you a gift.

239
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,420
I'll give this place to you. Aren't you starting a gaming company?

240
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,680
After renovating this place, it should be suitable for your startup period.

241
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,000
Uncle, those were your terms. I didn't agree with them.

242
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,580
Don't you want it?

243
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,100
I don't.

244
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,540
Good boy! You got ambition.

245
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,530
I just think there's more joy in starting from the ground up.

246
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,670
Moreover, I've already found a place.

247
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,720
We're both oddballs with gene mutations. We both like tinkering with computers.

248
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,420
You mentioned that your father is in archaeology and your mom in history.

249
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,710
And yet, you're into computer science! I can tell that you are of the same color as your uncle here.

250
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,750
I don't have enough energy to manage this place.

251
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,560
If you don't want this place, I'll let it go vacant first.

252
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,490
Boss, there's a call for you.

253
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,040
Okay.

What's wrong now?

273
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,920
I don't know how to solve this problem.

274
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,540
Erxi, can you please go and collect my bed sheet for me?

275
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm busy.

276
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,200
This one.

277
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,490
<i>Hurry. It's going to rain. Hurry.</i>

<i>Hurry up! Hurry up!</i>

Erxi, can you get my bed sheet for me, please?

280
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,460
With the time you spent asking me to get it for you, you could have already collected yourself.

281
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,550
- Don't I have a face mask on, do I?
- Si Si, Si Si...

282
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,630
- Someone's knocking. Someone's knocking.
- So annoying.
- <i>Erxi, open the door.</i>

283
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,160
- Coming.
- <i>Xiao Ling, hurry up.</i>

284
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh my! Thank you, Weiwei. Thank you!

285
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,770
It's raining so hard. Why didn't anyone get the sheet?

286
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,120
Weiwei, you came back so late. Where did you go?

287
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,300
Do you even need to ask? For sure, Heroine Bei went to conquer the online game.

288
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,170
I was the one who brought her computer back for her.

289
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,780
That's right. I've returned it to its proper owner now.

290
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,910
Thank you, Heroine Erxi.

291
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,240
It reminds me when Heroine Bei and I tried to help someone today, we were almost irritated to death.

292
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,170
- What happened?
- It's all because of Meng Yiran!

293
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,990
Meng Yiran?

294
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,330
Weiwei, when did you get to know Meng Yiran? I never heard you talk about her.

295
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,620
I don't know her.

296
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,030
We happened to run into her when we went to the electronics store earlier today.

297
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,920
The owner tried to rip her off by trying to sell her a RAM for double the market price since she didn't know any better.

298
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,460
I couldn't just watch without doing anything as a Computer Science major.

299
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,720
You were obviously helping her, but what did she say?

300
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,900
"Fellow classmates, thank you. However, I believe the store owner wouldn't lie to us."

301
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,680
"And he has a business to run, so it's only fair that he should make a profit."

302
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,610
She's acting all noble, but what about us?

303
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,760
She made us look petty and stingy; consequently, the owner wouldn't even sell anything to us.

304
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,850
Weiwei, what are you going to do about your computer?

305
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,330
Replacing the motherboard has always been expensive. So, I've thought about it.

306
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,070
Later, I can just buy a capacitor part and switch it myself.

307
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,230
Capacitor part?

308
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,860
Even though I am also a student in the Department of Computer Science,

309
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,020
I feel, however, Bei Weiwei and I are in different Computer Science departments.

310
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,010
I don't understand at all.

311
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,680
Plus one (<i>Me too</i>).

312
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,030
I am so lonely, forlorn, and cold.

313
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,850
Where is the thing I put here this morning? Did anyone see it?

314
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,080
Are you looking for your notebook of gaming notes?

315
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,650
<i>Do you know where it is?</i>

316
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,040
It's right here.

317
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,820
Thank you, kisses.

318
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,940
You take notes everyday, but I don't even know what you are jotting down.

319
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,850
In your life, other than studying, playing games and taking notes, can't you do something else?

320
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,630
I don't need anything else. I find this very fulfilling. You shouldn't underestimate this.

321
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,370
This notebook might help me one day become a game developer.

322
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,670
If I am lucky, I might be able to work for Feng Teng Corporation

323
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,100
or be part of the team that designs the new "A Chinese Ghost Story II."

324
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,030
Erxi!

325
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,720
I just don't get it.

326
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,400
Other people play games to kill time, but you play games to plan your future.

327
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,430
The brain of a genius is truly different from us normal people.

328
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,490
Yiran, I'm currently writing a draft. Just wait for me here for a moment. I will be done soon.

329
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,760
So was that Weiwei who helped us haggle yesterday?

330
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,500
Yes, the one who got second place in the school beauty contest; the one who lost to you.

331
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,530
She's quite pretty.

332
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,150
How is she pretty when compared to you?

333
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,400
Her look is so common,

334
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,740
just like a flower vase you put in the corner (<i>of the room</i>).

335
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,930
If she were in a TV drama, she would be the supporting actress.

336
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,100
There is no way she can match your aura.

337
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,690
Na Na, you shouldn't talk about her like that.

338
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,430
Fine, fine, fine. Can't I even speak the truth?

339
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,830
She's a bit different from what I thought.

340
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,200
She seems quite helpful.

341
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,500
Yiran, don't fall for her trick.

342
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,000
She is only trying to show off and make us look foolish.

343
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,220
It doesn't seem to be the case.

344
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,500
Miss Yiran, just because you like a boy who is a computer science major,

345
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,620
it doesn't mean that all computer science students are nice people.

346
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,460
- Stop talking nonsense.
- I mean it.

347
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,630
A few days ago, Cao Guang took a picture of Bei Weiwei getting out of a fancy car.

348
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,460
That car is worth at least several millions.

349
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Bei Weiwei isn't as innocent as you think.

350
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,530
- Really?
- Of course!

351
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,410
Speaking of the devil... he just got here.

352
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,800
Cao Guang, about the picture you took of Bei Weiwei getting out of a fancy car, can you please let me and Yiran see it?

353
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,650
How did you know about that?

354
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,800
I was right behind you,

355
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,960
but you reacted so fast. I didn't even think about taking a photo.

356
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,320
- I've deleted it.
- You've deleted it?

357
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,430
Did you fall for her and are trying to protect her?

358
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,940
You must be joking. Why would I like that kind of girl?

359
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,000
Yiran, did you hear what Cao Guang just said?

360
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,110
One's appearance comes from what's in the heart. So, don't be so naive.

361
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,890
Weiwei, Zhen Yi Technology is also recruiting summer interns; looking for some from the Computer Science Department.

362
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,690
Why don't I help you apply for it?

363
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,960
Okay, that sounds good.

364
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,220
I need to find an internship for summer break anyway.

365
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,610
Why don't you help Xiao Ling and Si Si apply as well?

366
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,720
Okay!

367
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,700
Done.

368
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,970
You really fixed it.

369
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,200
In the future when I have computer problems, I will be relying on you.

370
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,010
No problem. Five-cent repair services at your disposal.

371
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,430
The minute you fix your computer, you go and play your game. Gaming is your life.

372
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,670
I've already studied what I needed to study for

373
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,860
and finished the homework that I needed to do.

374
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,850
This only shows how efficient I am.

375
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,660
Wow, I threw out a casual compliment and you are falling in love with yourself!

376
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,890
Actually, I used to think that playing games was a waste of time.

377
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,600
But after playing the game, I realized that it's like entering a whole new world.

378
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,170
If you have both the dream and talent, why not work hard for your goals?

379
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,760
Weiwei, come to the Stone of Three Lives. Let's dissolve our partnership.

380
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,100
Why?

381
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm sorry. Don't ask why.

382
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,390
I will give you a set of Heaven Reverse equipment as compensation.

383
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,430
<i>There's even a break-up compensation?</i>

384
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,480
<i>No need. I'm coming over. I will see you soon.</i>

385
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,100
You're here, Weiwei.

386
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,180
I'm really sorry.

387
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,660
It's okay.

388
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,510
Let's go now.

389
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,590
<i>What is this eve with the same moon as before, and how long will the love and hate last?</i>

390
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,650
<i>As the sea and earth switch their places, as the moon cycles through the dimly crescent and brightly full, the fate of marriage is the hardest to find.</i>

391
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,230
<i>[Are you sure you want to dissolve this partnership?]</i>

392
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,200
<i>[Confirm]</i>

393
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,210
<i>As you drink the Water of Forget Love, the heroic couple will become strangers.</i>

394
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,100
<i>The relationship between Luwei Weiwei and Zhenshui Wuxiang has been broken.</i>

395
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,990
<i>From this moment on, the fate between them has ended and the two no longer have any attachment to each other.</i>

396
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,160
I still have other quests, so I will be leaving now.

397
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,700
Wait a moment.

398
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,070
Please accept this equipment set.

399
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,830
Just think of it as my compensation to you.

400
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,290
Really, no need.

401
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,520
We became a couple, so that we could complete the quests.

402
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,840
No need to feel any burden when we break up.

403
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,700
I am going to do my daily quests now. If we ever have the chance again, let's fight monsters together.

404
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,850
All right, then.

405
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,840
Weiwei!

406
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,170
- How can you still be in the mood to gather herbs?
- What's wrong?

407
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,560
Yet you're asking me why! Did you split up with Zhenshui?

408
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,920
Yes, I thought it was something serious.

409
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,650
How can you be so calm?

410
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,140
I heard he's going to form a couple with Xiaoyu Yaoyao.

411
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,460
Xiaoyu Yaoyao?

412
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,060
Did you not know?

413
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,990
She placed first in the poll for Dream Angel, and is also known as the number one beauty.

414
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,460
Hurry up to take a look on the website. Stop gathering herbs.

415
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,400
I'll go now.

416
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,550
<i>[Dream Angel]</i>

417
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,940
<i>[First Place: Xiaoyu Yaoyao]</i>

418
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,410
<i>Did you guys really break up?</i>

419
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,010
<i>Yes. We only became a couple to complete quests of the game.</i>

420
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,230
<i>Don't think too much about it.</i>

421
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,070
<i>I still find it a shame.</i>

422
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,730
<i>Actually, Zhenshui's pretty nice.</i>

423
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,970
<i>Who knew he would also fold before a pretty face?</i>

424
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,460
<i>However, Xiaoyu Yaoyao is quite pretty.</i>

425
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,670
<i>I heard Xiaoyu Yaoyao's target before was someone on the equipment ranking leaderboard.</i>

426
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,150
<i>I didn't expect her to pair up with Zhenshui.</i>

427
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,200
<i>But lately, I've often spotted them training together to level up.</i>

428
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,270
<i>Oh, so that's what happened.</i>

429
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,720
<i>I don't blame Zhenshui, though.</i>

430
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,750
<i>Weiwei, actually...</i>

431
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,040
<i>Actually what?</i>

432
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,210
<i>Your skill is so strong.</i>

433
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,160
<i>You're sixth in the player ranking.</i>

434
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,650
<i>Moreover, you never ask men for equipment and don't share your profile picture.</i>

435
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:39,640
<i>Actually, everybody suspects you're a transvestite.</i>

436
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,280
<i>Transvestite?</i>

437
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,620
Come on! I'm a transvestite just because I won't show my profile picture?!

438
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,230
What will become of this world that focuses only on the face?

439
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,760
Bei Weiwei!

440
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,360
You're the beauty queen of the department! If you say that, what are the rest of us to do?

441
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,320
Quiet down. Just when I was getting to the best part

442
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,460
and imagining myself as the female lead, you then yanked me back to reality!

443
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,330
<i>Congratulations to Hero Zhenshui Wuxiang</i>

444
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,340
<i>and Heroine Xiaoyu Yaoyao for your pledge of eternal love</i>

445
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,940
<i>in forming this happy union.</i>

446
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,850
<i>- So impressive!
- Yes, yes.</i>

447
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,570
<i>- I have high hopes for them.
- Yes, they're very capable.
- They are quite a good match.
- Yes.</i>

448
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,190
<i>Are you kidding? It's a match made in Heaven.</i>

449
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,730
What's that?

450
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,560
<i>That's right.</i>

451
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,600
<i>[Xiaoyu Qingqing - Xiaoyu Feifei - Xiaoyu Mianmian]</i>
(Note: Player names from left to right)

452
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,420
<i>[Luwei Weiwei]</i>

453
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,450
<i>[Xiaoyu Qingqing - Xiaoyu Feifei - Xiaoyu Mianmian]</i>

454
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,340
Take a guess about how much money Zhenshui Wuxiang will give this time with his red envelope?

455
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,560
888 yuan for prosperity. That's what I want, anyway.

456
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,850
I can't help but think of Luwei Weiwei right now.

457
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,340
I wonder how she's feeling.

458
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,060
Luwei Weiwei?

459
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,040
<i>Isn't this Luwei Weiwei?</i>

460
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,800
<i>Does everybody see that? I saw Zhenshui Wuxiang's former partner standing on the Vermilion Bird Bridge!</i>

461
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,380
<i>Yes, Yes, I see her! It's true.</i>

462
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,170
<i>I see her. I feel the sight of her backside seems so sad.</i>

463
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,870
<i>This world only cherishes the cheers from the new couple.</i>

464
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,490
<i>When did they ever notice the weeping of the old partner?</i>

465
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,150
My goodness! It's going to be fun today!

466
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,630
She might be here to snatch the groom.

467
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,580
<i>Internet slang again?</i>

468
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,770
<i>- I hate internet slang the most!</i>
- Weiwei, hurry up! I need to go too!

469
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,690
- <i>So what about the internet slang? Are you discriminating against another medium?</i>
- Wait for a moment.

470
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,530
<i>I support Luwei Weiwei to snatch Zhenshui!</i>

471
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,610
<i>Xiaoyu Yaoyao is mine!</i>

472
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,360
All right, almost done!

473
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,480
<i>Third wheel! She's a pretty woman, but why would she resort to this tactic?</i>

474
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,330
<i>Why so ostentatious? Her partner was taken. Of course, she has to show her displeasure.</i>

475
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,000
<i>- Xiaoyu Yaoyao is shameless!
- Xiaoyu Yaoyao is shameless!</i>

476
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,600
<i>She's really shameless.</i>

477
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,320
<i>Player Xiaoyu Yaoyao is shameless.</i>

478
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,070
<i>[User]108 banned for 24 hours for using uncivilized language.</i>

479
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,920
What's wrong with that Luwei Weiwei?

480
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,610
She's been dumped, yet still has the nerve to show up and cause trouble?

481
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,860
That's right, Zhenshui. How did you handle things?

482
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,120
That ugly woman must dislike Yaoyao and deliberately came to cause trouble.

483
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,070
Our Yaoyao is being bullied. You'd better give us an explanation!

484
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,250
That's right. Give us an explanation!

485
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,560
Don't blame Zhenshui. He doesn't want this, either.

486
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,700
I trust him.

487
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,010
Yaoyao, I will clear this up.

488
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,850
Weiwei, hurry up!

489
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,170
I only went to the bathroom. What did I just do...

490
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,070
for everyone to mistake me for planning to snatch the groom?

491
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,870
If I run off now,

492
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,220
the gossiping masses will surely believe that I'm heartbroken and running off in tears.

493
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,970
<i>What's going on? Weren't you cool with it yesterday?</i>

494
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,990
<i>Also, I already tried to compensate you. You didn't want it yourself.</i>

495
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,190
<i>Fellow player, I just came to join in the festivities.</i>

496
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,470
It's awkward whether I leave or stay.

497
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,610
I got it!

508
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,800

Brother Yixiao Naihe, did you called out to me?

517
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,420
What did you think of this event?

518
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,330
<i>Did the legend come here to gossip as well?</i>

519
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,510
It's very grand.

520
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,040
Would you like to have an even grander wedding ceremony?

521
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,830
Couple up with me.
