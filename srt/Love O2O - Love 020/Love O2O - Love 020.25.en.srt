<i>♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫</i>

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,620
<i>♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫</i>

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,700
<i>♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫</i>

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,540

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,020
<i>♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫</i>

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,140
<i>♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫</i>

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,960
<i>♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫</i>

20

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,390
<i>♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫</i>

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,420
<i>Hello? Weiwei, what's wrong?</i>

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,410
Nothing. Then I'll hang up first.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,220
Hello?

29
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,230
Let's take off work early today.

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,980
We will move your stuff to my apartment and move my stuff to my parents' place later.

31
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,100
I can do it on my own.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,400
Are you sure?

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,570
Absolutely.

34
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,840
They are indeed living together.

35
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,870
Luwei Weiwei, we meet again.

36
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,460
Zhenshui Wuxiang?

37
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,260
That's my gaming username. My real name is Zhen Shaoxiang.

38
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,340
You can call me "Shaoxiang."

39
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,610
Where are you going? Let me give you a lift.

40
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,540
No need. I can go on my own.

41
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,170
Don't be shy. Although we had some misunderstandings when we were in the game,

42
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,370
we are still considered acquaintances. Right?

43
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,640
It has nothing to do with the game. I don't wish to give you any hassle.

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,250
Thank you.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,470
Fine. I won't force you then.

46
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,500
By the way, what's your real name?

47
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,420
If we meet again, I can't still call you Luwei Weiwei. Right?

48
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,300
That's so awkward.

49
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,870
I think we probably won't meet again.

50
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,000
I think we will.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Actually, Zhao Erxi told me what your real name is.

52
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,670
If not, how would I know that you were living here?

53
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,290
Did she tell you that my family name is Lu?

54
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,650
<i>So, your family name is Lu.</i>

55
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,990
Of course.

56
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,720
What are you laughing at?

57
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,020
Let me give you a lift. It will take a long time for you to walk.

58
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,000
No need. I'm going to my boyfriend's place.

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,200
I fear it's not convenient for you to give me a lift there.

60
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,160
Your boyfriend? Xiao Nai?

61
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,690
A while ago, he came to my company to seek funding,

62
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,090
but it's an unseasoned team made up of students after all.

63
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,450
If I remember correctly,

64
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,670
your company is Zhen Yi Technology. Right?

65
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,830
Mr. Zhen,

66
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,120
if we are discussing from the perspective of a company, Zhi Yi Technology and Zhen Yi Technology

67
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,240
are both competing for the development rights of "A New Chinese Ghost Story."

68
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,350
This means both companies are on equal footing.

69
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,260
In terms of individual standpoint,

70
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,730
my boyfriend is the main programmer and decision maker at Zhi Yi Technology.

71
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,010
I wonder what Mr. Zhen's position in Zhen Yi Technology is.

72
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,980
On behalf of my boyfriend,

73
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,830
I thank you for not investing in them back then.

74
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,520
She has the same temperament as when she's in the game. How Interesting!

75
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,220
I cleared half of my wardrobe for you.

76
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,070
Hang up your stuff as you please.

77
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,330
I will wait for you to pack first before I unpack.

78
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,510
Are you really letting me have your apartment?

79
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,920
I don't have any confidence in my self-control.

80
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,480
Fortunately, I can still go to my parents' place.

81
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,190
If not, I would have to sleep on the floor in the office.

82
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,300
Help me with the clean-up.

83
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,250
I'm going to get a mop.

84
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,130
Okay, thanks. I know.

85
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,140
The maintenance guy will be here tomorrow.

86
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,670
Fortunately, this chest is fine.

87
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,270
Or else, Professor Xiao would be hugging this and crying for three days.

88
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,100
I think with the way you talk about your father,

89
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,160
Professor Xiao will cry for three days.

90
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,880
What will you do with this then?

91
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,770
Pack it and keep it at my place.

92
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,130
These are manuscripts. Find a bag to keep them in.

93
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,460
Don't worry. Your paintings of Wu Guanzhong are fine.

94
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,670
Xu Beihong's are fine, too.

95
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,260
I have packed them.

96
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,450
I will keep them at my apartment off campus for the time being.

97
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,960
Okay.

98
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,620
Where should we place these?

99
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,890
There aren't any suitable places.

100
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,850
Leave them in the wardrobe first.

101
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,870
You said that you weren't staying at your parents' place, you

102
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,650
would have to sleep on the floor in the office.

103
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,020
So, where are you staying tonight?

104
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,030
I don't mind sleeping on the floor in the office,

105
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,200
but these paintings have been collected by my parents for many years.

106
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,090
Nothing must happen to them.

107
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,230
If you are here alone, I will worry.

108
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,250
And so?

109
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,420
I will stay here and keep watch over them.

110
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,800

<i>♫ I want to give you a hug and make the whole world know♫</i>

121

<i>Just a little lethargic and staring out of the window all the time.</i>

122
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,300
<i>She probably misses you.</i>

123
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,800
<i>Hehehe, I have succeeded in winning over Coffee's heart.</i>

124

<i>"I will dismiss you with my gas."</i>

128
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,940
<i>Are you still angry with me?</i>

129
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,910
<i>It was my fault before.</i>

130
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,180
<i>I will wait for you at the same old place in the game.</i>

131
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,120
<i>I will let you kill me a hundred times. Won't this do?</i>

132
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,340
<i>Are you still angry with me?</i>

133

<i>It was my fault before.</i>

<i>I will let you kill me a hundred times. Won't this do?</i>

136
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,110
Coffee, Coffee.

137
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,420
Your poop scooper is really ditching us.

138
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,970
Women are such a hassle.

139
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,900
That's right.

140
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,810
I haven't settled the score with someone. I almost forgot.

141
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,140
Yiran, about the video in my cellphone,

142
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,810
did you delete it?

143
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,050
I didn't. What's wrong?

144
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,960
This is strange. Why did the video in my cellphone suddenly go missing?

145
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,020
By the way, what was Xiao Nai's reaction after he saw it?

146
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,720
- I don't know either.
- You don't?

147
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,700
That's right. He asked me where the video was shot

148
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,830
and when it was shot. So I told him everything.

149
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,920
He wanted me to delete the video in my cellphone.

150
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,830
That's it?

151
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,890
Yes, that's it.

152
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,540
What's Xiao Nai's reaction then?

153
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,450
Did he see Bei Weiwei's true colors?

154
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,870
This is not right. All the copies of the video are gone from our cellphones.

155
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,760
It's fine since he saw it. He should understand.

156
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,730
Perhaps, they are having a row about breaking up.

157
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,700
Why did Cao Guang call me?

158
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,840
Hello, Cao Guang. What's up?

159
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,920
You and Meng Yiran meet me at the south gate of the school tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. I have to talk to you about something.

160
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,960
What's with your attitude? You think you can order us to go. Who do you think you are?

161
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,980
You secretly filmed me and distributed the video

162
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,320
<i>to slander a student. Who do you think you are?</i>

163
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,230
If I don't see you tomorrow, you will live with the consequence yourself.

164
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,230
You!

165
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,630
Hello? Hello?

166
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,250
Yiran, what should we do?

167
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,660
I heard Cao Guang's family is quite powerful.

168
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,870
Is he going to settle a score with us?

169
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,920
It was wrong of you to secretly film him

170
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,150
but your intention wasn't bad.

171
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,180
If he's a reasonable person,

172
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,360
he probably wouldn't give you a hard time.

173
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,920
How did Cao Guang know that I shot the video?

174
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,080
Did Xiao Nai tell him?

175
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,920
That's right. Why didn't I think of this?

176
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,250
Xiao Nai must have been looking for confirmation from Cao Guang.

177
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,970
Na Na, he believed me.

178
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,230
There is this mounting evidence. How could he not believe it?

179
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,110
I wonder what love potion Bei Weiwei made him take.

180
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,760
It took me so long to think of this. I'm so stupid.

181
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,490
Is Cao Guang looking for us because he found it embarrassing?

182
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,960
He was dumped by her and his love rival even went to see him.

183
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,560
He must have been totally humiliated.

184
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,860
Probably so.

185
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,710
Everything's fine. When he's here,

186
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,030
just apologize and everything should be fine.

187
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,780
Cao Guang, you asked us here,

188
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,420
but you are late yourself.

189
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,000
We waited a long time for you under the harsh sun.

190
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,380
Aren't you too cruel?

191
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,340
You probably know that I'm here to settle the score with you.

192
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,130
Stop talking to me in this manner.

193
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,790
This is how I usually talk.

194
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,040
It was my fault for secretly filming you

195
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,540
but I didn't do it on purpose.

196
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,000
I just happened to film it.

197
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,860
Fine, I will apologize to you. Okay?

198
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,790
As a person of respect and stature, please forgive me.

199
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,260
Cao Guang, Na Na's action was wrong

200
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,400
but her intention was good.

201
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,430
She didn't want you and Xiao Nai to be deceived.

202
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,170
Meng Yiran, you like Xiao Nai, right?

203
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,110
You are trying to snatch Xiao Nai from Bei Weiwei.

204
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,750
It has nothing to do with whether I like him or not.

205
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,460
I merely didn't want you and schoolmates to be deceived.

206
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,780
Stop trying to give these dignified justifications.

207
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,800
You clearly know why you did it.

208
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,640
Also, no matter how hard you work,

209
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,030
Xiao Nai won't think highly of stupid people like you.

210
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,940
How could you talk to girls this way?

211
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,830
You should be grateful that you are girls.

212
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,140
If not, do you think I would let you off that easily?

213
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,350
Na Na, this matter ends here.

214
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,610
I won't pursue it any further.

215
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm warning you. Watch your mouths.

216
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,360
If I hear any more negative rumors about Bei Weiwei,

217
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,850
whether the source is from you or not, I will hold you responsible.

218
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,770
In the end, it's still about Bei Weiwei.

219
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,910
I didn't expect a talented scholar like you

220
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,600
would turn out to be a sex-crazed silly fool.

221
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,430
Just because of a two-timing girl, you went all out to protect her!

222
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,280
Didn't you hear what I just said?

223
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,390
You were the one who said two-timing.

224
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,870
I didn't say that.

225
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,890
I got the wrong person!

226
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,170
Got the wrong person?

227
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,830
Wasn't it Bei Weiwei?

228
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,120
Who was it then?

229
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,630
No matter who it was, it doesn't concern you!

230
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,430
Remember this. Watch what you say.

231
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,170
Otherwise, don't fault me for not being nice to you.

232
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,230
You!

233
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,190
Let me wish you good luck.

234
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,350
Also, in the future, you can go after guys,

235
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,170
but by using this kind of despicable tactic repeatedly, aren't you becoming too unseemly?

236
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,190
Don't you need to go to work in the afternoon, either?

237
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,240
The progress for the game is going well. So, there's no need to work overtime.

238
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,930
Are you trying to kick me out?

239
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,320
How could I? I was afraid that by walking around, I would disturb your work.

240
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,780
Bring your laptop

241
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,830
and sit next to me for a while.

242
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,450
<i>I didn't expect to meet again today.</i>

243
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,080
<i>Luwei, do you still remember this place?</i>

244
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,400
<i>When we fought that boss together after we first became a couple,</i>

245
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,470
<i>it seemed to be this place.</i>

246
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,070
<i>We didn't have enough people then and could have been eliminated.</i>

247
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,560
<i>In the end, thanks to your strike, you saved the whole team.</i>

248
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,280
<i>Every time when we entered a dungeon, you were always in front.</i>

249
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,410
<i>You have never needed anyone to take care of you.</i>

250
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,820
<i>I really miss those times when we fought together.</i>

251
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,920
<i>Thinking about it now, only with you, we</i>

252
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,560
<i>were the couple with the best tacit understanding.</i>

253
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,700
<i>If it wasn't in the game,</i>

254
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,760
<i>I couldn't say these words face-to-face.</i>

255
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,060
<i>Weiwei, are you there?</i>

256
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,990
<i>Are you disconnected?</i>

257
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,360
<i>Luwei Weiwei, in the past, I was ignorant.</i>

258
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,960
<i>After going in a circle, I finally understood</i>

259
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,970
<i>what kind of person is most suitable for me.</i>

260
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,040
<i>Every person makes mistakes. I have made many mistakes.</i>

261
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,800
<i>If it was possible, I really would hope that all these things didn't happen</i>

262
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,660
<i>but it's probably not too late now.</i>

263
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,110
<i>Give me another chance to start over.</i>

264
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,350
<i>Answer me, okay?</i>

265
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,650
<i>I'm Yixiao Naihe.</i>

266
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,390
What's going on?

267
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,260
Reminiscing about the past.

268
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,420
I think Zhenshui Wuxiang must be very angry with you.

269
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,900
Did you bump into him yesterday?

270
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,810
That's right. I wonder how he tricked Erxi into giving him the address.

271
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,400
He waited at the entrance for me and even lied that he knew my name.

272
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,960
I know Erxi.

273
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,910
No matter how angry she is, she will never betray me.

274
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,180
So I tricked him into exposing himself.

275
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,140
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,940
It was too easy to handle and I forgot about it.

277
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,130
The missus indeed has been getting confessions growing up.

278
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,140
Remember to brief me in the future.

279
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,590
For the sake of equality, you must do the same.

280
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,370
It's true that it's easy to forget. Never mind.

281
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,930
Why do I feel that I'm that kind of legendary

282
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,480
femme fatale? I always run into lousy romances.

283
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,170
Fortunately, I got you.

284
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,920
So, Yixiao Naihe is Xiao Nai.

285
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,660
Main programmer and decision maker of Zhi Yi Technology?

286
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,270
So you think you are that great?

287
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,280
In my eyes, you are nothing!

288
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,480
Did you read the documents I gave you last time?

289
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,490
You should know that if we use these documents to sue your friend,

290
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,900
your friend's future will be destroyed.

291
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,300
I fear he may be imprisoned, too.

292
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,310
What do you want?

293
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,370
As long as you work with us

294
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,470
and obtain what we want,

295
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,010
we won't sue you.

296
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,420
You are thinking too highly of me.

297
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,390
All of Xiao Nai's critical codes

298
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,790
have been encrypted with a 128-bit key.

299
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,690
With my ability, I can't break the code.

300
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,450
If there is any other information about him,

301
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,890
we will happily accept it, too.

302
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,940
How can you guarantee that Zhen Yi won't sue?

303
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,310
Other than this, you don't have any other choice.

304
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,370
Okay.

305
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
But even if you know,

306
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,730
you have a slim chance of winning.

307
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,940
People make things happen.

308
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,880
What's the situation with Zhi Yi?

309
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,390
That person said there's currently a fatal flaw with the game.

310
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,640
The game consumes a lot of memory during the execution of the game,

311
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,090
but Xiao Nai is working on a tool to optimize it.

312
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,590
As soon as its development is finished, it can be applied to the game

313
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,670
and reduce the usage of memory tremendously.

314
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,240
Can he succeed?

315
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,180
They seem to be quite confident.

316
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,260
They said it will be completed by September 15.

317
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,260
Then, we must not let them succeed.

318
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,120
But our guy is not in a key position.

319
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,910
He may not be able to sabotage it.

320
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,720
It's impossible on the side of Zhi Yi Technology.

321
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,250
Then, what if the demo date at Feng Teng Technologies is moved forward?

322
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,650
That's right. In any case, we have completed our demo.

323
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,180
I will give it a try, President Zhen.

324
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,080
Manager Zhen.

325
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,070
Dad, is the company competing for the development rights for "A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

326
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,640
Go back to work.

327
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,430
Today is the weekend.

328
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,460
Young Master Zhen, why are you in the mood to come into the office today?

329
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,640
Dad, I'm serious.

330
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,500
Is the company competing for the development rights for "A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

331
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,850
How long have you been with the company?

332
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,260
And you only think about this issue now?

333
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,010
I want to ask you. When will you really settle down,

334
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,060
and truly pay attention to the company for me?

335
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,780
Now's the time.

336
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,890
Dad, I want to join this project.

337
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,160
I guarantee we can outdo Zhi Yi Technology

338
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,630
and obtain the development rights for this game.

339
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,360
You? Just don't make troubles for me.

340
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
Dad, why are you like this?

341
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,080
I'm a player of the elite level in "A Chinese Ghost Story."

342
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,260
Moreover, who in this company knows the game better than I do?

343
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,480
I must take part in this project.

344
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,180
I will definitely beat Xiao Nai to a pulp!

345
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,390
Are you being serious?

346
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,840
I can't be more serious than this, Dad.

347
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,290
Okay.

348
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,270
My son has finally grown up.

349
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,210
The company spent so much money to hire you

350
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,770
and you only did this?

351
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,620
Manager, do you feel that we should make some improvements?

352
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,820
Have you guys played the "A Chinese Ghost Story" game?

353
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,270
- Yes.
- How long have you been playing?

354
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,700
A little more than a year.

355
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,730
A year or so? How did you play?

356
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,870
Did you just wander around in the game for a while every day and then leave?

357
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,160
As a veteran player of "A Chinese Ghost Player," let me tell you,

358
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,550
your demo doesn't appeal to me at all.

359
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,170
Let's not even mention the many players out there.

360
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,780
The appearance of the characters is mediocre. The character's skills are indistinct.

361
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,260
The scenery is way too crude.

362
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,390
Creativity? I didn't even see it.

363
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,110
Manager, are you saying that...

364
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,380
I have been playing this game for many years.

365
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,020
I have my own thoughts and ideas.

366
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,500
Just revise according to what I say.

367
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,210
Manager, we only have a mere month more before the bid.

368
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,200
If we make the modifications now, I fear we will not make it on time.

369
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,970
I don't want to hear this phrase, "We will not make it on time."

370
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,610
Your overtime will pay five times your regular rate. If there isn't enough manpower,

371
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,590
recruit people now.

372
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,020
All of our players are very young.

373
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,000
Is this a drawing of a ghost?

374
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,190
Young Master is an expert hiding behind the scenes.

375
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,640
Young Master's demeanor now is showing strong resemblance with you, President Zhen.

376
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,520
President Zhen, you have taught him well.

377
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,890
Young Master will accomplish great feats in the future.

378
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,890
What's the status of that task?

379
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,450
There was a great opportunity, and we took advantage of it. No one will be able to tell.

380
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
Well done.

381
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,480
But Young Master's plan may not be implemented on time.

382
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,900
He will have plenty of opportunities to demonstrate his potential. Once we get this project,

383
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,440
he will have all the time he wants for development.

384
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,020
But... regarding our plan,

385
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,100
don't tell him. I'm afraid it might affect his feelings.

386
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,130
Yes, I understand.

387
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,560
Okay.

388
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,890
Why isn't Third Brother back yet?

389
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,290
Hey, Third Brother is getting food for me and he's not back yet. I'm starving.

390
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,840
Do you have anything to eat?

391
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,030
- In my drawer, there are things which squirrels love to eat. Help yourself. <i>(Note: referring to snack logo of a squirrel)</i>
- Thank you.

392
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,070
<i>[Home Purchase Contract]</i>

393
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,370
What are you doing?

394
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,410
What is this?

395
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,670
Home Purchase Contract? There are even two.

396
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,430
And paid off in one lump sum.

397
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,080
What are you doing?

398
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,950
What is this?

399
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,990
It's mine. Give it back to me.

400
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,060
Everyone, come and look at this scheming boy!

401
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,320
Hao Mei has something to tell everyone.

402
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,840
What is this?

403
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,880
There are even two sets.

404
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,390
It's two sets.

405
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,490
Scheming boy.

406
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,770
Why didn't you tell me when you went to rob a bank?

407
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,630
That's right, Brother Hao. How much balance do you still have left from your lottery winnings?

408
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,240
Why don't you buy houses for everyone here?

409
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,330
Brother Mei, you're a real estate mogul, yet you've been hiding among us proletarians for all this time.

410
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,240
What for?

411
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,220
Brothers, this is a harmonious society.

412
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,040
We should talk in a civilized manner.

413
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,450
You must not get violent!

414
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,920
K.O., help me!

415
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,660
Come out.

416
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,020
K.O., we are from the same rank.

417
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,960
You shouldn't be an enemy of the people.

418
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,370
What are they doing? Are they bullying Mr. Beauty?

419
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,130
Let's take a look.

420
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,760
Get him out from there. Come here.

421
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,270
Darn Beauty!

422
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,270
Hao Mei, how can you forsake us?

423
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,130
When we were in school, why did a mogul like you borrow money from a poor student like me?

424
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,400
Each time you borrowed so much! Have you paid any of it back?

425
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,430
Do you think I wanted to do that? I was poor then.

426
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,470
Thinking about when I applied for Tsinghua University behind my father's back,

427
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,140
I only got ¥600 per month.

428
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,410
Had I known Beijing had Third Brother and sandstorms, I never would have come here!

429
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,290
Who cares whether you would come or not? Catch him!

430
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,560
- Catch him!
- I will treat you guys to a meal!

431
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,610
Senior Hao Mei really thinks so highly of you. He even put you in the same category as sandstorms.

432
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:45,050
Give this to Yugong. Also, tell Hao Mei casually that I'll remember this.

433
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,580
<i>[Notification of New Demo Meeting Time]</i>

434
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,370
Buddies, I found a great hotpot place nearby.

435
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,880
Its food is really tasty and the price inexpensive, too.

436
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,850
I spit on it. Eating this kind of inexpensive hotpot

437
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,810
is an insult to our Brother Mei's two homes.

438
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,570
- That's right.
- We should go for the most expensive food.

439
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,570
The most expensive one.

440
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,080
Junior Sister Weiwei,

441
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,330
what would you like to eat?

442
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,790
It's fine as long as it's expensive.

443
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,370
You... not one of you is a decent person.

444
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,050
Let's go for seafood then. Seafood is the most expensive. It's several thousands when you order a regular meal.

445
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,280
<i>It completely suits the stature of our Mogul Brother.</i>

446
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,250
It's seafood then. How about the seafood night stall?

447
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,340
You guys think in such lowly terms.

448
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,820
What is considered high end?

449
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,070
Is a seafood stall good enough? Isn't that right, Brother Mei?

450
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,600
<i>- It's not.
- That's right.</i>

451
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,240
Yes.

452
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,900
Third Brother, you have been to many places.

453
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,350
Choose one and let's go with Brother Mei.

454
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,000
Meet in the conference room in five minutes.
