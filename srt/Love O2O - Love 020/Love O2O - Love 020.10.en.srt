So how about it? I picked this one for Weiwei.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,300
I have good taste, right?

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,390
Nice. Let me take a picture.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,900
Hurry up. Come on.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,100
<i>1...2...3. Yay!</i>

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Xiao Ling, couldn't you help me pick one

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
more suitable for a good woman from a nice family?

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,100
Attendant, do you have anything else which is more suitable for a good woman from a nice family?

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
How is our dress not suitable for a good woman?

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,600
It's just that... this lady has a nice figure. When she wears this, it's...

36
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,990
Let me see!

37
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,970
- Stop fooling around.
- Let me see!

38
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,800
Why do you suddenly want to buy new clothes?

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Because the clothes that I bought last year are showing pills.
<i>(Pills: (of knitted fabric) form small balls of fluff on its surface)</i>

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,030
But didn't I tell you about this problem quite a while ago?

41
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,230
You were pretty content in wearing them.

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,620
Moreover, you didn't need to come out now to buy new clothes.

43
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,670
You have an exam tomorrow.

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,970
I have an important interview tomorrow.

45
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,350
Which psycho company conducts interviews on Saturdays?

46
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,570
Furthermore, it will be after 11:00 a.m. when we finish our exam tomorrow.

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,800
Here. This is the type for a good woman.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,350
- Thank you.
- Go and try it.

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,770
<i>This is not considered as lying. The interview tomorrow</i>

50
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,670
<i>can change my life.</i>

51
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,830
How about it?

52
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,200
Applause!

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,620
You finally succeeded in your disguise as a good woman from a nice family.

54
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,000
Weiwei, do you need to be so formal?

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,900
It's just an interview.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,620
Moreover, have you not always emphasized about inner qualities?

57
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,270
This is my first interview.

58
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,920
Inner qualities are just like the fleeting cloud.

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,830
Such a top weapon

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,830
would be better saved to be my trump card.

61
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,380
Awesome.

62
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,750
Shoes.

63
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,200
What's wrong with your shoes?

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
Your shoes look nice.

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,620
Just change the color and it will complement well.

66
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,310
This is my size.

67
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,490
No. This doesn't go with your dress. You should wear high heels.

68
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,030
They are too high. I'm already 169 cm (5.5 ft).

69
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,960
If I wear this, I will be at least 175 cm tall (5.7 ft).

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,330
Flat shoes are still better. Let me try this.

71
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,030
I really can't stand you.

72
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,980
It's just an interview. What are you worried about?

73
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,560
Are you afraid that you would be taller than the interviewer?

74
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,610
Your guess is right.

75
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,220
<i>If Naihe is not that tall, what should I do?</i>

76
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,020
Her dress is too conservative.

77
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,960
Her dress is refreshing and neat.

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,910
It suits her well.

79
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,900
For an interview, it also makes sense to dress like a student.

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,130
Come with me to change my dress.

81
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,070
<i>Am I the only one who thinks it's more seductive to be totally buttoned up?</i>

82
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,430
<i>What is the taboo beauty? This is it!</i>

83
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,330
Weiwei, you are great at bargaining. You bought the entire set at such a great price.

84
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,870
My bargaining skill is so good that I'm lonely.

85
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,660
Weiwei, why do I feel that you picked up some bad influence? You are becoming more and more narcissistic.

86
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,980
Yes, I seem to have gotten some bad influence indeed.

87
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,480
This is called "Getting stained when you are close to the black ink."

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,580
Nope, it should be "Hued scarlet when you come near the vermilion paint."
<i>(Note: Positive instead of bad influence)</i>

89
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,810
- She's talking about you!
- Am I the pig?
<i>(Note: Vermilion and pig are pronounced the same.)</i>

90
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,520
Yiran, isn't that Bei Weiwei?

91
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,000
The boutique where she shopped seems pretty nice.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,650
Let's go in and take a look.

93
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,370
No. When you look closely at the dresses in that little shop, you will find out that they aren't that good.

94
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,700
Furthermore, the cost of the dress shows how much you are worth.

95
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,260
Buying her dress there really reveals her class.

96
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,580
Yiran!

97
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,630
What's wrong with you all? Why do we need to wear a dress when you take an exam?

98
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,100
- I'm going directly there after the exam.
- Huh?

99
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,630
The interview.

100
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,760
It's rare for Weiwei to wear a dress. Let's coordinate a little for her.

101
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,740
We are not even in the same exam room. Why must we try to coordinate?

102
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,020
This is really a distraction to my focus on the exam.

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm afraid that when I take the test, I will start to admire myself.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,660
Oh my...

105
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,600
I can't stand you.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,720
Did Weiwei infect you with her narcissism?

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,300
- Who are you talking about?
- You!

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,310
She's talking about you!

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,070
We are going to be late. Let's hurry.

110
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,130
Let's go now.

111
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,030
<i>[Follow the exam rules strictly and stay relaxed in taking the exam] </i>

112
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,710
Isn't that Bei Weiwei?

113
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,700
She seems to be really pretty.

114
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,400
But why does she need to dress up like this for the exam?

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,030
How did she dress up?

116
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,860
- She didn't even put make-up on.
- When you are pretty, you look good no matter what.

117
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,170

<i>Master should be on his way to Tsinghua University.</i>

121
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>Will he be as nervous as me?</i>

122

<i>Is that person standing under the willow tree Xiao Nai?</i>

<i>It's really Xiao Nai.</i>

126
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,330
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

127
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,800
<i>It seems that he's waiting for someone, too.</i>

128
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,490
<i>Who's good enough</i>

129
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,160
<i>to make Master Xiao wait like this? </i>

130
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,280
<i>Why do I get the feeling that this looks somewhat familiar?</i>

131
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>I must be mistaken.</i>

132
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,680
<i>Why does he keep staring at me?</i>

133
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,210
<i>Could it be Master Xiao knows I'm in the Computer Science Department?</i>

134
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,970
<i>That's why he looked at me a few more times.</i>

135
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,220
<i>This sounds more logical.</i>

136
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,110
<i>Then, should I say hello to him?</i>

137
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,770
<i>After all, he's my senior in the same department.</i>

138
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,990
<i>But by doing this, would he think that I'm trying to hit on him?</i>

139
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,230
Senior Xiao, what a coincidence!

140
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,650
<i>Why didn't I restrain myself? I should have just walked past him. Why did I greet him?</i>

141
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,840
<i>He is now ignoring me, right?</i>

142
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,900
It isn't a coincidence. I have been waiting for you.

143
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,040
Me?

144
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,160
You are Naihe?

It's me.

<i>Fortunately, I didn't buy the pair of high heels.</i>

<i>Or I would have ruined them from the shock.</i>

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,070
<i>Naihe, Xiao Nai? Xiao Nai, Naihe?</i>

149
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,890
<i>If Naihe is really Xiao Nai,</i>

150
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,360
<i>how can Naihe be Xiao Nai then?</i>

151
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,330
You handed in your exam paper early.

152
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,600
If I came later, I would have made you wait.

153
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,690
Are you talking about the final?

154
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,440
It's okay.

155
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,400
<i>Is he really Naihe?</i>

156
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Let's go. I will treat you to a meal.

157
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,370
<i>Will another Naihe show up later?</i>

158
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,000
<i>If Xiao Nai is Naihe,</i>

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,170
<i>the whole thing is too unreal.</i>

160
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,100
Weiwei.

161
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,430
Do you eat fish?

162
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,690
Weiwei?

163
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,200
Thank you, Senior.

164
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,140
<i>[Okay] </i>

165
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,370
Aunt Jiang can't talk but the food she cooks is really delicious.

166
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,300
My parents aren't good at cooking. When I was young,

167
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,990
if I didn't eat at the cafeteria, I would be eating here.

168
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,110
When you were young?

169
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,180
Is there anything else you want to eat?

170
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,300
No need. It's such a big bowl of soup.

171
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,870
It won't be easy to just finish it.

172
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,730
Are there any Chinese medicinal herbs in this soup?

173
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,150
After the car accident,

174
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,370
my father ordered half a month's worth of fish head soup with Szechuan lovage and gastrodia elata here, to help my head heal.

175
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,480
Professor Xiao? I took his class.

176
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,260
Do you fall asleep?

177
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,800
Although his course is a bit too academic, it's still pretty good.

178
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,100
Actually, he talks about some of his archaeology experiences

179
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,300
which are pretty interesting.

180
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,090
I've taken his class, too.

181
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,470
You don't need to say nice things about him.

182
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,330
That's right. I sat next to you once.

183
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,100
I know.

184
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,950
<i>You know? What does that mean?</i>

185
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,870
<i>In Master's eyes, we common earthlings really don't exist.</i>

186
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,700
<i>Could it be that Master has had too much to eat</i>

187
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,180
<i>and has invited me to help him eat?</i>

188
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,270
<i>That's not right. Why would Master do something sinister like that?</i>

189
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,670
<i>He definitely wouldn't.</i>

190
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,810
<i>It's so quiet. Should I say something?</i>

191
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,830
<i>Xiao Nai seems so different when he's Naihe online.</i>

192
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,110
<i>He's totally different. He seems more distant.</i>

193
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,910
<i>Forget it.</i>

194
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,210
<i>I heard that Xiao Nai's parents are both from a scholarly family.</i>

195
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,590
<i>Maybe, they have a rule to stay quiet during meals.</i>

196
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:09,500
<i>The more you say, the more you get wrong. I should save my strength for the future.</i>

197
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,400
<i>That's right. Safety first.</i>

198
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,630
<i>I should just eat the fish.</i>

199
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,070
Drink more.

<i>Does he miss the days when he was kidnapped?</i>

203
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,300
Third Brother, where are you?

204
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,220
It's the final game today. Aren't you coming?

205
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,360
Isn't it at 7:00 p.m.? It's still early.

206
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,530
Come here early. Everyone's waiting for you for warm-up.

207
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,810
What are you doing today?

208
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,030
<i>Come immediately.</i>

209
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,350
- I am busy.
- Busy?

210
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,740
What is it? Didn't you already complete your work?

211
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,930
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

212
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,470
On a date.

213
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,100
Date?

214
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,940
Third Brother, are you on a date?

215
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,500
<i>Bring her along.</i>

216
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,620
I will ask her if she's willing.

217
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,120
Do you want to come to watch the farewell basketball game for us seniors?

218
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,100
I will bring her later.

00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,620
Are they coming?

220
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,660
Have some more. Don't rush.

221
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,600
I will return to get my bike later. We can go there together.

<i>he looks good on a bike, too.</i>

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,050
Wait. Well...

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,710
Well... are you giving me a ride?

229
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,770
Yes. It's some distance away. How can we walk there?

230
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,140
You are taking me to a basketball gym. Is this appropriate?

231
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,510
When people see us, they will misunderstand.

232
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,080
Misunderstand?

233
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,420
Misunderstand that... we are in this kind of relationship.

234
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,890
Since when were we not in this kind of relationship?

<i>Since when... were we in this kind of relationship?</i>

<i>Although I want to be in this kind of relationship,</i>

238
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,510
<i>I don't want to start like this.</i>

239

<i>But come to think of it...</i>

240
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,550
<i>I came with the intention of sealing the deal with Master.</i>

241

<i>Now that this upgraded Master said something like this,</i>

<i>if I don't accept, wouldn't I lose my opportunity?</i>

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,630
<i>I will lose whether I accept or not.</i>

<i>What's going on? Stop, stop, stop!</i>

245
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,760
<i>Stop thinking. Don't be swayed by his words. There won't be a way out.</i>

246
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,890
<i>Just pretend that I didn't hear that. I will treat him as a virus and keep my distance from him.</i>

<i>That's right. Just get on the bike.</i>

248

<i>If we walk, we might run into more people.</i>

249

<i>The bike is faster.</i>

<i>Maybe before anyone could find out it's me,</i>

<i>I would have just blown by them.</i>

252

Frankly, my biking skill is not bad.

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,450
Hence, your facial expression doesn't need to look as if

<i>So what if he's Xiao Nai?</i>

<i>In the future, he will be Xiao Nai.</i>

<i>He's just Naihe. That's why I like him.</i>

Wait for me.

286

<i>There's a time and place to be courageous.</i>

287

<i>The courage now doesn't include</i>

<i>walking into the basketball gym with Xiao Nai under so many watchful eyes.</i>

289
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,860
Well... I'm going to watch the game with my roommates. Catch up with you later on the internet.

Weiwei!

291
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,330
Hurry and go warm up. Give your seat to Weiwei.

292
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,740
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

293
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,110
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

294
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,170
Come here, Weiwei.

295
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,650
Weiwei, it's going to be fun today.

296
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,980
- How so?
- A lot of beautiful girls came today,

297
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,220
like Jiang Ruru from the Foreign Language Department, Li Hanyu from the Chemistry Department.

298
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,980
The school beauty queen is here, too. She's sitting over there.

299
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,760
Is this the first time that the top two beauty queens of our school appeared at the same venue together?

300
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,340
It seems so.

301
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,050
If we knew that Meng Yiran would be here, Weiwei should have worn that red dress.

302
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,790
- You would roll over her and clean her clock.
- That's right.

303
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,660
Meng Yiran's figure really can't compare to our Weiwei's.

304
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,560
Frankly, our Weiwei's look is much prettier than hers.

305
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,610
<i>Just who sneakily took that photo of Weiwei in the contest last year?</i>

306
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,720
<i>It was such an awful picture.</i>

307
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,330
<i>Compared to Meng Yiran's glamour shot, she was really at a disadvantage.</i>

308
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,140
That's right. Yet Weiwei didn't allow us to send in better-looking photos.

309
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,960
- She should have taken a few more.
- That's right.

310
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,770
Eat something. Eat something.

311
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,420
Wow! Weiwei, did you strike it rich? You bought so many tasty snacks. How much did these cost?

312
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,040
I want to eat this.

313
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,050
Wow, my favorite dried mangoes.

314
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,580
There're also roasted cashews.

315
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,650
Weiwei, why didn't you buy my favorite pecans?

316
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,960
- I brought snacks and yet you are still so picky?
- I will eat. I was wrong.

317
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,040
<i>Master bought all these in three minutes</i>

318
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,010
<i>and you still expect him to be picky?</i>

319
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,120
Weiwei, didn't you go for the interview?

320
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,850
Is that why you bought these to celebrate?

321
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,500
You can consider it so.

322
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,440
You went for the interview. How was it?

323
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,780
Well... the process was a failure but the result was unexpected.

324
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,160
Who cares about that? Anyway, it's good that you passed.

325
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,760
That's right. What's most important is that...

326
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,630
Master Xiao Nai will be here today!

327
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,260
<i>Of course, I know he will be here.</i>

328
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,510
<i>He bought the snacks that you are eating now.</i>

329
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,340
I say, today's match is between the Computer Science Department and the Architecture Department.

330
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,150
Meng Yiran is not from our department. What is she doing here?

331
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,200
Si Si, you are wrong if you think this way.

332
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Good looking guys are resources to be shared by the entire universe.

333
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,360
You must not have any partisan view.

334
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,300
Look.

335
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,220
What did I say? Bei Weiwei will definitely be here today.

336
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,880
How could a girl like her give up such an opportunity?

337
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,650
These cashews taste great.

338
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,880
Give me some. Don't finish everything by yourself.

339
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,950
- You ate them so fast.
- How annoying!

340
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,030
<i>[Master, I love you]</i>

341
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,790
Students, go back to your seats!

342
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,170
Move it. Go!

343
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,410
Third Brother, what are you doing here?

344
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,080
Where is she?

345
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,550
Where's the person you were on a date with?

346
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,870
That's right. I texted Hao Mei to rush here.

347
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,730
- She fled.
- Huh? Fled?

348
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,810
She was scared off by you guys.

349
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm so adorable. Would I scare anyone?

350
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,630
<i>These guys should be the two on the phone.</i>

351
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,960
<i>Could they be Yugong and Houzi Jiu?</i>

352
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,480
Okay, I'm going to change.

353
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,180
Yiran, Xiao Nai was looking at you just now.

354
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,160
It can't be. There are so many people here.

355
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,570
For goodness sake. Everyone here is just a wallpaper for you.

356
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,460
Moreover, didn't you meet Xiao Nai at your uncle's company?

357
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,770
He definitely remembers you.

358
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,010
Didn't Bei Weiwei sit in the same class as him

359
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,390
and not talk to him at all? Isn't that so?

360
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,610
- Who do you think Xiao Nai was looking at just now?
- Meng Yiran?

361
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,860
Not necessarily so. There are many beautiful girls here today.

362
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,140
But he was looking in our direction just now.

363
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,190
There's only Meng Yiran there.

364
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,910
I remember now.

365
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,570
Xiao Nai and Meng Yiran probably know each other.

366
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,550
The only time Xiao Nai joined the school party, Meng Yiran was on stage.

367
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,910
Although they didn't perform in the same program,

368
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,550
they both were playing traditional instruments.

369
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,270
Perhaps, they might have had some exchange.

370
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,930
Xiao Nai might not be looking at girls, okay?

371
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,530
Why are you making him seem so vulgar?

372
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,860
Please, stop being so naive.

373
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,680
When did Xiao Nai ever look at the spectator stand? He always acts like he's alone.

374
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,170
His target is definitely...

375
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,060
There's only one.

376
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,550
He was looking at...

377
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,940
me.

378
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,370
- Let's go.
- Coming.

379
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,920
<i>- Do your best. - Do your best.</i>

380
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,300
Brother Hou, I just saw Third Brother take a look at the spectator stand.

381
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,900
There's definitely a problem.

382
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,740
This is the first time I saw nothing wrong in your logic.

383
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,330
I say, Third Brother. Never mind that she has a pretty face,

384
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,210
her figure is also not bad.

385
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,620
Stop changing the topic.

386
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,730
Third Brother, tell us who you were looking at.

387
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,290
Which beautiful girl were you looking at?

388
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,020
I discovered that our school beauty queen was in that direction.

389
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,060
Also, the beauty queen of our department with a special connection to me.

390
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,790
I already told you that it's none of your business.

391
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,990
You'd better give us some clarification.

392
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,720
By the way, your head was just healed. Will you be okay playing today?

393
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,040
Don't worry. I'm fine.

394
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,350
Hurry up. Let's get changed.

395
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,160
Weiwei, don't you know that you and Xiao Nai are known schoolwide

396
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,960
as the most unlikely couple?

397
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
What's this "the most unlikely?"

398
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,910
It's in a popular gossip forum about the school campus.

399
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,630
They paired up the most popular single students.

400
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,660
You and Xiao Nai are the least compatible.

401
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Why are there discussions like that? People in school really have nothing to do.

402
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,930
Xiao Ling, I suddenly remember that I still have a homework assignment to finish. Have you done it? Let me borrow it.

403
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,290
- Okay.
- How are we not compatible?

404
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,210
Weiwei, why are you taking something meaningless so seriously?

405
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,720
Those people in the forum are merely talking about...

406
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,870
appearance, professions...

407
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,610
What else did they say? Let me think. I remember now.

408
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:17,890
They say one is graceful and elegant like the Chinese ink drawing.

409
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,510
The other one is striking and colorful like an oil painting.

410
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,890
One is a saintly immortal in Heaven; and the other, a beauty with fortune and stature on earth.

411
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,590
What's with that expression of yours?

412
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,290
I'm getting goosebumps from hearing this.

413
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,620
Also, I'm not oily at all. Okay?

414
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,290
What a lame joke!

415
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,830
How can our professions not be compatible? We are both in the Computer Science Department.

416
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,800
A couple of IT heroes.

417
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,460
What are you laughing at?

418
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,130
Can you come up with an even worse nickname?

419
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,950
There wouldn't be any motivation to idolize when you are in the same profession, okay?

420
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,020
Moreover, Computer Science is but one of many of Xiao Nai's areas of expertise.

421
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,860
Then let me ask you this. Who do they say is compatible with Xiao Nai?

422
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,480
I don't think there is anyone. Everybody has some people opposing the idea.

423
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,720
That's right then.

424
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,730
<i>Hurray!</i>

425
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,540
Xiao Nai is really everyone's idol.

426
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,870
They say Xiao Nai is even better at swimming than basketball.

427
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,350
I wonder how he is in a swimming competition.

428
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,150
Weiwei, why are you so hot?

429
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,160
- You are such a pervert.
- What? Me?

430
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,780
- You are such a pervert!
- You are such a pervert!

431
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,940
- I think I'm innocent.
- You too.

432
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,020
- You are a pervert, too.
- Who says so?

433

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,910
Everyone did well.

446
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,410
- Later...
- What?

447
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,820
I think we can up our speed.

448
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,650
- Da Zhong, your rebounding...
- Okay, leave it to me.

449
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,480
Houzi, In terms of covering the open spots, especially on defense, I think you can do better.

450
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,070
Xiao Nai was so cool when he changed direction in the air.

451
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,330
When I go back, I'm going to tell Da Zhong to practice that.

452
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,560
This seems quite demanding of the body.

453
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,470
I don't know.

454
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,960
Xiao Nai is really talented at everything.

455
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,840
<i> This person is too extraordinary. </i>

456

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,830
<i>Quick.</i>

461
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,810
Replace me later.

462
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,410
Okay.

463
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,220
Da Zhong is indeed right.

464
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,010
Senior Xiao Nai is only playing half of the game today.

465
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,860
Why?

466
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,440
It's a farewell game. Moreover, the reserve players who are seniors will also take the court.

467
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,350
I also heard that

468
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,090
Xiao Nai got into a car accident recently.

469
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,220
A car accident?

470
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,270
It's not very good for his body to exercise for too long, right?

471
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,170
Why did I forget about that?

472
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,430
Why is he still playing?

473
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,720
What did you forget?

474
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,310
Nothing.

475
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,620
We are going out later. I may not go online tonight.

476
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,750
What do you plan to do tomorrow?

477
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,680
- Studying.
- Okay, I will go with you.

478
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,640
Okay, I'll save you a seat.

479
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,520
There's an empty spot over there. Do you all mind scooting over?

480
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,650
<i>What's going on?</i>

481
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,710
<i>What's going on? Are they together?</i>

482
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:36,040
