Go and clean the kitchen.

Don't come out until it's cleaned.

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,260
Thanks for the juice.

29

Thanks for your hard work!

Get cleaned up. I'll treat you for a meal.

Hurry up.

32

I'm concerned that you'll catch a cold.

33
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,540
Concerned that I'll catch a cold?

34
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,480
By the way, isn't your staff taking two weeks off?

35
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,410
You forced them to take leave but why didn't Yugong take time off?

36
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,180
He has to meet with the director of the music studio to discuss the soundtrack.

37

For the demo of "A New Chinese Ghost Story?"

The rain stopped. We can go now.

Why are you grinning?

40

Nothing.

41
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,030
I just think that as soon as you got here,

42
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,310
the weather has improved, too.

43

<i>Do I need to?</i>

Okay.

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,810
Weiwei, why did you come and see me out of the blue?

59
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,750
I'm here for my internship.

60
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,600
I couldn't find any suitable job back at home.

61
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,030
Is your company taking interns?

62
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,850
The standard for hiring at our company is very high.

63
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,280
I only want to be an intern. I won't ask for pay.

64
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,230
For free labor, we have to be even more careful.

65
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,180
Then just what do you want?

66
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,380
Bribe me.

67
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,920
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

68
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,310
Sorry, but other than your beauty,

69
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,890
I don't accept any other form of bribe.

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,800
<i>Director, why is she seducing him for a position as an intern?</i>

74
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,340
<i>Isn't that a bit illogical?</i>

75
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,230
<i>Weiwei, who cares if it is illogical?</i>

76
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,250
<i>It's written that way in the original work.</i>

<i>Our production will be a hit! Get to the key scene in ten minutes.</i>

<i>Action!</i>

<i>President Xiao,</i>

<i>I hear your company is hiring interns.</i>

<i>Don't you think I'm a good fit?</i>

89
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,510
<i>I'll have to have a try to find out.</i>

90
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,150
<i>Cut!</i>

91
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,550
<i>Nice Kiss. Again, from a different angle.</i>

92
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,430
How could I have such a shameful dream?

93
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,340
Forget it quickly! Forget it quickly!

94
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,350
What should I wear to work?

95
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,530
Fortunately, when I went home, Mom and I picked out some new clothes.

96
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,310
<i>Weiwei, are you already in the capital city?</i>

97
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,780
Yes, I got here last night.

98
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,300
<i>You came back to the capital city so suddenly to be an intern.</i>

99
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,700
<i>Is it because you couldn't bear the loneliness in staying away from your boyfriend?</i>

100
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,790
That's right. So don't come over and be the third wheel.

101
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,610
<i>How can you be like that? You favor your boyfriend over your friend?</i>

102
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm just kidding.

103

<i> I'm just kidding, too, Weiwei. </i>

104
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,070
<i>You're such a kind and understanding person. You must have already thoroughly cleaned Xiao Ling's place, right?</i>

105
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,460
<i>Can I just take my luggage and move in?</i>

106
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,350
Yeah, but what should we do? I forgot to clean your room.

107
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,270
<i> No way! Weiwei, how can you be so indecent? </i>

108
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,690
I'm just kidding.

109
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,180
It's all clean. Come quickly.

110
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,950
<i> Not bad, not bad. Then I'll come back a little sooner. </i>

111
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,090
<i>We'll live our own little married life and I'll work at my internship.</i>

112
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,110
Tell me when you get here. I'll pick you up at the station.

113
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,020
I'm going to hang up now and head to work.

114
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,950
<i> Why does it look like a couple's outfit? </i>

115
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,800
What a coincidence! Should I get changed?

116
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,790
Others will think we did it on purpose.

117
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,980
It's fine. Let's let them think so.

118
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,420
Let's go.

119
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,590
What will I do once I get there?

120
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,730
What do you like to do?

121
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,180
I don't know either.

122
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,240
It's fine as long as I have something to do.

123
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,070
Lately, we've been running tests on our mobile app.

124
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,670
You can work on that for a few days. After you become familiar with the company, I'll arrange other things for you to do.

125
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,520
Yugong happens to have work in both departments

126
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,310
You can follow him.

127
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,240
Yes, Boss!

128
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,340
You go in first.

129
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,900
I'll find Yugong by myself in a bit.

130
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,810
Why?

131
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,050
No reason. I'm shy.

132
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,220
I understand now.

133
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,090
Understand what?

134
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,220
What "shooting yourself in the foot" means.

135
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,400
Boss, this can't be our new employee, right?

136
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,290
She's an intern.

137
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
<i> Boss? </i>

138
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,660
<i> Is this what they call him at the company? </i>

139
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,840
Boss, are you guys...

140
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,820
Is this how you communicate in your company?

141
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,490
He's in the Programming Department.

142
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,910
Try to keep your distance from him.

143
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,200
Ah Shuang was afraid of women before,

144
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,920
but in front of you, he seemed to be immune.

145
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,920
With such exaggerated acting,

146
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,480
he must be in the Acting Department.

147
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,700
Boss brought the future boss lady to work.

148
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,490
Really?

149
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,310
Has Boss been taken for life?

150
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,860
I was going to marry my sister off to him.

151
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,940
You can introduce your sister to me. I'm single.

152
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,580
I can't marry my sister off to a good man,

153
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,350
but I can't push her into the flaming pit. Right?

154
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,640
Have you ever seen a flaming pit this handsome?

155
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,290
Boss is already at the entrance.

156
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,670
Weiwei, are you reporting for work right after returning from home?

157
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,620
You're truly our role model.

158
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,700
You take Weiwei on a tour of the company. I have a teleconference.

159
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,330
- Go with him. Complete your newbie village quest.
- Okay.

160
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,620
Third Brother, then am I the mayor of the newbie village?

161
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,950
Mayor, she's all yours.

162
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,370
Junior Weiwei, follow your mayor.

163
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,430
I'll help you get acclimated with the environment of our office.

164
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,720
Our company mainly focuses on development, so the structure is fairly simple.

165
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,030
It's divided into five departments.

166
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,010
Programming, planning, testing, art, and administration.

167
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,320
This is our Art Department.

168
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,140
They have the most people and are also the most cunning.

169
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,120
They're developing the prototype for NPCs.

170
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,600
They would even consider my looks.

171
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
Are you saying that they're using you for an NPC prototype?

172
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,610
Oh, it sounds like fun!

173
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,730
Well... this NPC prototype is the owner for Hospitable Spring Pavilion.
<i>(Note: Common name for a brothel)</i>

174
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,910
And her name is Ru Hua.
<i>(Note: Ru Hua means flower-like)</i>

175
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,350
Lately, they have been making the NPC prototypes for the Hospitable Spring Pavilion.

176
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,190
That is to say...

177
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll definitely stay away from them.

178
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,920
This is the Planning Department. Your husband is in charge.

179
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,530
It also includes the functions of plot planning and data planning.

180
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,790
The rest of the staff are his brothers.

181
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,310
What is it?

182
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,210
Nothing.

183
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,430
It can't be, you... I just said "husband."

184
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,460
- Isn't it just "husband"?
- Eh, Senior, I was just thinking,

185
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,060
in the future, should we tell your future wife

186
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,320
that you want to marry a rich lady?

187
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,710
You are not behaving like a cute girl anymore.

188
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,650
Why did I hear someone address Master as "Boss" just a moment ago?

189
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,950
That's right. There are also those who call him "Brother Xiao."

190
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,810
Like a crime syndicate?

191
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,980
Actually, for us working in internet communications, it is pretty similar to a crime syndicate.

192
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,240
Every day it's from dawn to dusk.

193
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,340
Furthermore, have a look.

194
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,720
All of us are young people, right?

195
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,690
If we called Third Brother something like General Manager,

196
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,090
or CEO Xiao, how lame would that be?

197
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,230
That's right. Here is the Programming Department. I need to introduce it to you in detail,

198
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,930
because this is our company's most awesome department.

199
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,280
Team A is nicknamed the "Hands of Three Masters."

200
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,180
Master?

201
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,930
Your husband doesn't count.

202
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,090
Other than him, Team A has 3 other people.

203
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,510
Do you see that guy? The guy with the crew cut.

204
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,650
That guy... isn't he Senior Hao Mei's friend, the chef who cooks really tasty food?

205
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,310
Yes. But he has another identity.

206
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,710
The famous hacker, K.O. Do you know of him?

207
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,200
Of course, I know of him. He's one of the best hackers in China.

208
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,420
Could it be?

209
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,310
It's him.

210
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,330
You're lying, right?

211
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,860
If I'm lying, I'm this.
<i>(Note: His hand shape means "wangbadan" which is a jerk)</i>

212
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,670
This guy was recruited by Third Brother.

213
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,870
I heard that they PK'ed a few times.

214
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,400
Anyhow, now he's a part of our company.

215
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,870
However, not many people know he's K.O.

216
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,550
I only told you because you're family. You have to keep it a secret.

217
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,610
- Actually, you probably told many people, right?
- Impossible.

218
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,020
I'm very good at keeping secrets.

219
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,450
However, even to this day, I still don't know what his name is.

220
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,480
Even his wage is given to him privately by Third Brother.

221
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm very certain that the reason he doesn't say his real name

222
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,330
is because his name is too lame.

223
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,060
Let me introduce you to another expert.

224
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,180
Him. In the future, when you see him, you must go around him.

225
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,730
No matter what you do, don't linger around him.

226
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,460
Why?

227
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,040
Junior Weiwei,

228
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,970
look around. Our entire company is like a monastery.

229
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,220
It's all because of him.

230
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,820
This... This fellow,

231
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,850
if he sees women, he can't write any code.

232
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,690
That serious?

233
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,440
However, don't think he's a good guy.

234
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,600
If you ask me, he must be too lecherous.

235
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,430
Then, with poor self-control, as soon as he sees women, he's unable to keep going.

236
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,910
Therefore, it's better if he doesn't see women at all.

237
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,600
<i>Why do I feel as though I'm in the realm of Jianghu?</i>

238
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,050
<i>These people are experts in Jianghu with weird quirks.</i>

239
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,230
Didn't you say there were Hands of Three Masters? Where's the other one?

240
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,990
The other one... is that pretty face.

241
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,210
Mr. Beauty Senior?

242
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,610
It feels as if the picture's not quite right.

243
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,110
Right? Aren't you suddenly disillusioned?

244
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,340
Still, it's not bad.

245
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,420
Actually, Mr. Beauty Senior's personality is pretty good.

246
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,250
That's true. Sometimes, having no personality at all is still a type of personality.

247
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,570
That's right, Weiwei. In the company, in the future, you can call me Senior Yugong;

248
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,580
however, don't call him Mo Zhata.

249
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,890
Then what should I call him?

250
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,470
Per the protocol in Jianghu, we call him Brother Mei.

251
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,740
What's wrong?

252
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,080
It's nothing...

253
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,180
I just suddenly want to perform crushing rocks on my chest.
<i>(Note: "Xiong kou sui da shi" is where you lie with a slab of rock on your chest and someone breaks it with a hammer)</i>

254
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,180
Hey, Junior. Have a drink to calm your nerves.

255
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,740
Finally, there is our Administrative Department.

256
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,850
There's actually not much to say about the Administrative Department.

257
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,330
You need to remember one point: you must be nice to them

258
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,950
because they are the ones who decide

259
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,080
whether your meal include three dishes with meat and one vegetarian plus drinks, or three vegetarian and one with meat, but no drinks.

260
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,170
The orientation is done.

261
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,330
Now I have to think about what first task I should assign to you.

262
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,250
I've got it. Recently, in testing the mobile game, Ah Shuang is responsible for following up on it.

263
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,220
You can work with Ah Shuang.

264
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,590
Ah Shuang. Ah Shuang!

265
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,290
A new person. I'm giving her to you. Please get along well.

266
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,530
Weiwei, I believe in you!

267
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,860
Hey, wait. Wait! Wait! Don't leave!

268
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,060
Wait. Don't leave!

269
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,400
Hello, I'm Bei Weiwei.

270
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,550
Can I call you Senior Ah Shuang?

271
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,770
I-I-I know. D-Don't come closer.

272
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,170
D-Don't call me that... Anyway, I'm not in charge of you.

273
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,250
Okay, okay.

274
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,030
However, Yugong told me to work with you.

275
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,220
Then go to tell Boss. I-I-I'm not training you.

276
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,020
He's busy right now. Don't be nervous.

277
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,210
Why don't I head over there?

278
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,160
If you need anything, just call me.

279
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,980
They sent a woman over.

280
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,440
What are they doing? A woman in IT just makes things worse.

281
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,860
You've never seen me work.

282
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,290
How could you know if I will cause a mess?

283
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,910
That's right. You haven't given her any task.

284
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,000
How would you know if she'll cause a mess?

285
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,470
Don't you think that I'm afraid of beating you up because K.O. is protecting you?

286
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,260
Come on. Come on.

287
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,120
What's wrong with K.O. helping me? Right, K.O.?

288
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,030
- Hmm.
- Hmm!

289
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,450
Then...

290
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,740
Then you try to solve this problem.

291
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,010
Cell phone testing report?

292
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,340
Th-The 20th page.

293
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,040
Cell phone testing on the issue of compatibility.

294
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
T-There are a few models of cell phones that are incompatible.

295
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,320
G-Go and find all of them.

296
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,110
A-Analyze further and m-make a report.

297
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,910
Is there a budget for finding these phones?

298
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,310
At most ¥600.

299
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,640
No reimbursement for anything above that.

300
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,470
Also, you'd best finish it before tomorrow afternoon.

301
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,350
Find on your own an empty spot around here as your work desk.

302
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,510
All right.

303
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,010
Also!

304
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,380
Don't look for me if you can't finish.

305
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,510
It would be best not to come to the company.

306
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,950
I will try my best.

307
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,710
Good luck!

308
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,750
Good luck! I believe in you.

309
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,440
Why have I never heard of these phones?

310
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,020
GESO.

311
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,820
Nothing.

312
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,120
Such unpopular phones.

313
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,150
Is there really a need to test them?

314
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,980
Let's try this.

315
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,210
X-f-l-e-x.

316
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,510
What a tongue twister!

317
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,300
¥1,200?

318
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,150
<i> It's impractical to buy this.</i>

319
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,820
<i> If I borrow it... School hasn't started and no classmates are here. </i>

320
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,050
<i> This is quite challenging. How should I solve it? </i>

321
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,960
<i> Forget it. I'll look over the report first. </i>

322
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,710
<i>I should understand the cell phone test first.</i>

323
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,860
Third Brother,

324
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,600
is the teleconference done?

325
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,770
First off, I'm not here to badmouth someone.

326
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,830
Banshan... I don't know whether his brain is cramping today, or he took the wrong medicine.

327
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,560
He put Weiwei under Ah Shuang.

328
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,720
Who doesn't know what Ah Shuang is like?

329
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,630
Now that Third Sister-in-Law has fallen under Ah Shuang's control...

330
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,410
Did you finish the optimization task I told you about?

331
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,190
Let's put work aside for a moment! I'm fired up!

332
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,890
I'm worrying for Third Sister-in-Law's well-being and reporting to you. Look at you...

333
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,020
Right, you probably don't know the latest news.

334
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,580
Do you remember that a couple of phone models are incompatible with our mobile game?

335
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,700
Ah Shuang wants Weiwei

336
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,350
to find all the incompatible phones and do more in-depth testing.

337
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,570
Is that necessary?

338
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,090
In my opinion, it's a waste of people and resources.

339
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,830
From what I can see, Ah Shuang is purposely making it hard for her.

340
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,400
Oh.

341
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,510
Is that it?

342
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,010
Go back to work if there's nothing else.

343
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,190
Even a tiger won't eat its own cubs.

344
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,680
Are you're really okay allowing others to bully her?

345
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,060
We'll regard it as a quest in the newbie village.

346
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,730
If she works under me, it will be even more difficult.

347
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,770
You win. You win. It's really a case of "A great man needs to be ruthless," right?

348
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,180
I have an appointment at noon. Go to have lunch with Yugong and the others.

349
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,680
Okay. I'll eat with... the mayor of the newbie village.

350
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,950
- Your drinks.
- Thanks.

351
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,800
I don't understand.

352
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,760
You assigned Weiwei to Ah Shuang.

353
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,350
When Third Sister-in-Law showed up at the office, Ah Shuang was already very displeased.
<i>(Note: Ah Shuang means very pleased. This is a pun.)</i>

354
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,830
And yet you let him train her?

355
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,660
Is it appropriate?

356
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm fighting fire with fire.

357
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
Look at our company. We're all lonely young men, one after another.

358
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,450
The only woman, comrade Weiwei, is already taken.

359
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,990
If I don't take action, what are we bachelors going to do in the future?

360
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,080
Seeing how tough our Third Sister-in-Law is,

361
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,540
she can definitely cure Ah Shuang.

362
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,840
At that time, we can...

363
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,610
find girls.

364
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,740
You make it sound as if someone would want you just because there are girls there.

365
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,270
It increases the odds.

366
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,490
Third Sister-in-Law, what task did Ah Shuang assign to you this morning?

367
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,430
Finding phones.

368
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,450
- What kind of phones?
- How dare you to ask?

369
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,750
Before tomorrow afternoon, Ah Shuang wants Third Sister-in-Law to

370
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,800
finish the phone incompatibility report.

371
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,750
Is there a need for such urgency?

372
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,920
Besides, those incompatible phones are probably already gone from the market.

373
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,950
That's right. It's apparent that he is giving her a hard time on purpose.

374
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,630
Third Sister-in-Law, don't worry. I'll help you beat him up.

375
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,810
No, no. I'll let Xiao Nai deal with him.

376
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,830
No need. Don't trouble Xiao Nai with something minor like this.

377
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,760
Also, I feel that

378
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,510
Ah Shuang looks down on women in IT.

379
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,800
If I go to Xiao Nai, doesn't that prove his point?

380
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,170
Is there something like that, too?

381
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,580
Yes, yes. I heard it, too. He said,

382
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,710
"Women in IT will just cause trouble."

383
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,080
But I've already thought of a solution

384
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,670
to make Ah Shuang change his views about women in IT.

385
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,570
What solution?

386
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,950
It's a secret.

387
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>Today, you ate the most. Let me tell you.</i>

388
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,490
<i>- It's you who eats the most, you glutton.
- Hey.</i>

389
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,780
Hey, Third Brother, why are you just leaving now?

390
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,880
I made an appointment for 1 o'clock.

391
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,510
I saw your bicycle over there. Let me borrow your key for a bit.

392
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,450
It's the office key.

393
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,780
The key to the bicycle is in a drawer in my office. Get it yourself.

394
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,720
The office key?

395
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm leaving now. Be careful.

396
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,910
Bye-bye.

397
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,810
I definitely need to talk to him.

398
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,310
How could he give the keys to the office so casually to someone?

399
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,800
In case Third Sister-in-Law is a mole, what should we do if she steals the code?

400
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,720
Such thoughtless behavior!

401
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,460
Hey, Brother, do you believe you can steal the code simply by having keys?

402
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,260
How shrewd is Third Brother? Each code has a 128-bit encryption.

403
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,170
It's an encryption code with an asymmetric combination.

404
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,760
That is to say that, not only would you fail to crack it, it would also destroy the computer.

405
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,540
So, Third Sister-in-Law plus keys

406
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,950
- is still of no use.
- It's an issue of principles.

407
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,880
What are you coughing–

408
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,350
If I were a mole,

409
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,300
I would sell you two off first.

410
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,480
Everyone's off work so early today.

411
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,200
Everyone left?

412
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,890
They went to have dinner.

413
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,450
Then, are you waiting for me?

414
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,550
I also got back late and didn't make it in time.

415
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,110
What are we eating tonight?

416
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,080
I ordered take-out. My lady will have to make do with eating together with me.

417
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,180
What task did Ah Shuang give you?

418
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,610
There are a few phones that are incompatible with the app version of the mobile game.

419
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,830
Ah Shuang wants me to give an analysis report by noon tomorrow.

420
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,310
Noon tomorrow? Did you solve it?

421
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,550
I have a preliminary solution.

422
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,870
I've found all the phones. I just need to test them,

423
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,850
and then can I finish the report.

424
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,300
I saved the company a lot of money.

425
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,230
I bought all the cell phones and still have about ¥500 left.
<i>(Note: Approx. $75 USD)</i>

426
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,100
My lady, are you showing your achievements right now?

427
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,610
Yes, I'm asking for praise.

428
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,610
Nothing to praise. Of the leftover money,

429
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,760
a portion of it is yours.

430
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,420
What?

431
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,710
According to my stock calculations, about 250 belongs to you.
<i>(Note: Calling someone 250 means they're dimwitted)</i>

432
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,160
It's you who's 250.

433
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,680
You like eating this.

434
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,660
It's discourteous not to reciprocate.

435
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,070
Right, I have to thank you.

436
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,700
Thank me for what?

437
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,600
Thank you for assigning me to Ah Shuang.

438
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,560
Actually, I was afraid you would be in charge of me from the start.

439
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,700
That'd be so awkward.

440
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,100
Anyway, it's great like this.

441
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,180
I'm really looking forward to what Ah Shuang will have me do next.

442
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,140
My lady, you put too much thought into the decision.

443
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:17,180
Letting Yugong take care of you was just to save myself the trouble.

444
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,980
You're lying to me again! Don't eat the ribs anymore.

445
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,010
I'm taking them all.

446
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:59,490
GESO, the second generation.

447
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,470
During the game,

448
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,870
there's a problem with the screen flickering.

449
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,090
The problem probably lies within the video card.

450
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,710
<i>With the X-Flex, a frequent recurring issue</i>

451
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,950
<i>was its crashing upon startup.</i>

452

Senior Ah Shuang, this is the detailed report.

481
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,880
I have included in it all the phone models, their respective issues, and the associated assessment.

482
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,030
I've also added some early suggestions, just for your reference.

483
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,350
W-W-What is this?

484
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,050
These are all the incompatible phones.

485
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:02,010
But I didn't go over budget. I only spent ¥150.

486
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,660
I found some used phone shops and websites that repair old phones.

487
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,390
I rented each phone at the price of ¥15 a day.
<i>(Note: Approx. $2 USD)</i>

488
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,090
I only need to return them today.

489
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,470
Senior Ah Shuang, I've completed the report based on your time and budget requirements.

490
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,830
If you are satisfied with my work so far,

491
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,160
you can assign me other tasks.

492
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,660
I...

493
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,930
You go first. I'll look at the report.

494
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
All right.

495
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,000

501
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,070
Hello? What do you need me for?

502
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,830
Okay. I'll see you later.

503
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,020
Erxi!

504
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,070
- Weiwei!
- Let me take it.

505
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,160
How are you?

506
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,150
It's pretty heavy!

507
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,640
I missed you so much!
