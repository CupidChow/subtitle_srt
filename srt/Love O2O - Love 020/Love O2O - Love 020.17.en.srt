Could it have been done by someone who knows us?

Last time you came here, you said you were going to throw this blanket away.

72
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,440
I felt that it was still in decent shape, so I kept it.

Coding in front of a computer all day

84
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,380
is definitely more than twice as tiring as you cooking all day.

No way! It's a company my buddies and I started together.

90
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,270
If I just quit, it would be too inconsiderate of me.

Not exactly.

The work our Third Brother takes on is twice of mine.

94
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,480
If I think in those terms, I feel a little better.

95

Your Third Brother?

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,380
That's right.

97

He was here last time, too. He's quite good looking.

The one who sat to my right. He's the one with his girlfriend.

99

I didn't notice.

100
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,510
Of course not. He was probably overshadowed by my dazzling looks.

Yep.

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560

Five minutes? Did you hack China Mobile?

121
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,650
No, I told China Mobile that I was being harassed by an unknown caller.

122

Its customer service is good.

<i> Then why didn't you call me?</i>

124
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,240

However, a good hacker isn't necessarily a good programmer.

Isn't he afraid of being beaten to death?

161
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,980
Normally, these kind of experts

162
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,750
like to be free and unconstrained.

163
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,900
How could he like working at our company?

164
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,760
What exactly did you do to him?

165
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,590
It's not that I did anything, it's what he wants to do.

166
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,490
Bro, can you speak our language? I don't understand.

167
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,380
This person is pretty weird; coming to work at night.

168
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,200
It won't be dangerous to us, right?

169
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,120
Big Brother, are you afraid?

170
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,070
- Don't you think the four of us couldn't overcome one guy? What is there to be afraid of?
- Right.

171
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,920
Where's Brother Mei?

172
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,620
Big Brother, what's that for?

173
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,440
Do you know what this is? This is the mop we use in the bathroom.

174
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,930
When he arrives, I'm going to kill him with it.

175
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,800
If I can't beat him to death with it, this will stink him to death.

176
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,770
Why is it you?

177
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,000
Did you get takeout?

178
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,410
So it is you.

179
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,770
It's me.

180
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,060
According to our agreement, I lost.

181
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,400
So I will work for free at your company for one year.

182
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,870
No need to skip the salary.

183
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,140
Welcome to Zhi Yi. I still haven't asked for your name.

184
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,380
You know it. It's K.O.

185
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,310
K.O.? Why does it sound so familiar?

186
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,270
I remember now!

187
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,770
You can't be that super awesome, super famous hacker, can you?

188
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,520
- The one who in 2011...
- Right.

189
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,230
Third Brother, he can't be...

190
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,160
Y-Y-You...

191
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,950
It's me.

192
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,500
Also, we agreed on no salary, so no salary.

193
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,130
I won't go back on my word.

194
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Then I'll put you under Hao Mei.

195
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,550
Hao Mei, you found K.O. You will take responsibility.

196
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,690
Me?

197
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,500
This will be your desk from now on.

198
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,820
Third Brother had someone especially clean it for you.

199
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,980
I say that you really have it good.

200
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,470
Our CEO Xiao permits you to work from home as an exception.

201
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,520
Not like us, toiling all day here to be whipped around by him.

202
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,230
Are you not mad anymore?

203
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,760
I was still angry just now.

204
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,230
You dared to lie to me and even hacked my computer,

205
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,980
but later I felt some excitement.

206
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,910
Think about it. I went to a food stand for a late night snack,

207
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,240
got to know a cook, and he turned out to be

208
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,450
the renown hacker, K.O.

209
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,730
It feels like seeing that... floor-sweeping monk.

210
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,440
What's a floor-sweeping monk?

211
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,110
Don't you know what the floor-sweeping monk is?

212
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,510
I'll explain it to you next time.

213
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,940
But I only have one question.

214
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,640
What is it?

215
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,520
Why did you switch my goddess on my desktop

216
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,960
to a temple?

217
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,990
She's not good looking.

218
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm telling you. You can insult me,

219
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,040
but if you insult my goddess, I will have an issue with you.

220
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,260
No, I've thought of a question even more serious.

221
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,630
You'll be my co-worker from now on.

222
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,970
Then the issue with my meals...

223
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,950
How am I going to resolve this?

224
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,740
Meeting dismissed.

225
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,170
We're about to get paid soon. When are you treating us to dinner?

226
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,310
- Your treat?
- You're so cheap!

227
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,390
That K.O. is really good. Since he got here

228
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,770
Hao Mei no longer makes a fuss here. His face has returned to its bright and soft state.

229
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,760
That's all due to their friendship.

230
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,070
Oh, right. Are you and Weiwei still living in separate places?

231
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,260
How else? Without the proper relationship, it's unbecoming.

232
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,120
It's only been so long. What do you want me to do?

233
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,530
Listen. These words,

234
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,690
this tone,

235
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,580
your time has finally come.

236
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,580
Third Brother, actually I really feel for you.

237
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,900
Since we are both in the disheartened group, why don't we tonight...

238
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,260
Are you leaving so early today? Where are you going?

239
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,310
Getting married and having children.

<i>[Stone of Three Lives]</i>

The marriage is fated to take place in spite of distance. Even Majestic Beasts have fated lovers.

242
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,220
I am the matchmaker in the world of Majestic Beasts. Today, you two have asked me to be here.

243
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,920
Which pair of divine pets are waiting for me to bestow my blessing?

244
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,830
Wonderful, wonderful. These are a pair of cultivated Majestic Beasts rarely seen in this world.

245
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,020
You can see that the owners have trained them very thoughtfully.

246

You have great taste. This phone has a great battery capacity and charges quickly.

278
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,150
You can talk for two hours after just charging for five minutes.

All right, I'll take this one.

315
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,920
<i> What is this? </i>

316
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,110
<i>Hello, Bei Weiwei. Through the Bank of China's online banking service, Xiao Nai</i>

317
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,540
<i>has transferred ¥1,000 to your card, ending in the numbers 2540.</i>

318
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm going to make a phone call. You guys eat.

319
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,450
You actually transferred me the money? It was a prank!

320
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,500
I know it was a prank from you.

321
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,240
How did you know it was me?

322
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,040
I checked the location of the phone. It happened to be in the same city as you.

323
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,100
What?

324
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,180
Could it be that every time you get spam,

325
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
you look up the address?

326
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,120
That's not it. It's just that the bank account you gave looked familiar, so I checked it.

327
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,740
Weiwei, your trickery isn't professional enough.

328
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,270
For the transfer, you didn't even include the recipient's name.

329
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,770
My bank card... in your presence, I think it only appeared once,

330
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,350
yet you remembered it?

331
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,130
That's too amazing!

332
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,250
Miss Bei, you think too much of me.

333
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,940
You don't even include the recipient's name for a wire transfer. Your skill of trickery isn't up to par.

334
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,820
Then, you knew it was me, but still made the transfer?

335
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,390
Buy a plane ticket.

336
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,120
Weiwei, flowers are blooming on the street.

337
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,150
Enjoy the spectacle on your return.

338
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,120
You have to leave after returning for just a few days.

339
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,150
Why didn't you tell us you applied for a summer internship?

340
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,020
It's so sudden.

341
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,380
I just got the notification.

342
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,610
What company? Is it reliable?

343
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,030
The people in it... should be quite reliable.

344
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,490
Then where are you going to stay? At the school?

345
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,090
Weiwei, there's a package for you.

346
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,660
Almost done with the clothes?

347
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,270
Room and board has been settled. Xiao Ling has a house near the school, and can lend it to me. This is the key.

348
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,140
What? Are you staying in someone else's home?

349
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,610
It's not too convenient, right?

350
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,030
That's right. It's not good to stay at someone else's house, right?

351
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,300
It's fine. Xiao Ling is my good friend.

352
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,010
Okay, then.

353
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,270
But you are really... why didn't you say something sooner about this kind of plan?

354
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,650
We could have helped you prepare some necessities to bring over.

355
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,020
It's fine, Dad. I don't lack anything.

356
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,450
Also, it's very convenient around the school. I can just buy it if I need anything.

357
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,350
"Yuyang's Thoughts on Poetry." Wow.

358
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,320
When did you start reading this?

359
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,300
I... casually read it. Improving my literary knowledge.

360
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,830
Weiwei, it's so hot. Don't work too hard.

361
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,550
You have to take care of yourself.

362
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,310
If there's anything wrong, just call us.

363
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,540
Your mom is right. We're not by your side,

364
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,590
so you need to rely on yourself for everything.

365
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,220
I know. I take good care of myself. Don't worry. Why are you getting so emotional?

366
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,890
Let's go. Time to cook.

367
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,200
Hey, but your company is pretty good. It even provides plane tickets to interns.

368
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,990
<i>I didn't tell Master when I would be back.</i>

369
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,440
<i>If I show up in front of him,</i>

370
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,080
<i>I wonder if he will be surprised or shocked?</i>

371
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,830
<i> Forget it. I'm happy as long as I get to see him. </i>

372
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,000
It's fine if people have a break on the weekends.

373
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,740
But do elevators need a break, too?

374
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,200
The elevator is fixed?

375
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,850
- Hello, Director Fang.
- Hello.

376
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,960
I'm Xiao Yu. I'm sorry for asking you to make a trip on such a hot day.

377
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,930
No problem.

378
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,980
CEO Xiao and the others were originally going to greet you personally,

379
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,480
but they had to take a phone call.

380
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,260
No problem. I came at an inconvenient time.

381
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,570
The key is that the music of the scenario has been released,

382
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,670
and I wanted you guys to listen to it right away.

383
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,810
Also, your President Xiao is an expert in this field.

384
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,140
I want to ask him to give his opinion.

385
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,080
<i> What's going on? Didn't Master say that today </i>

386
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,580
<i> he was the only person in the office? </i>

387
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,530
<i> That's why I dared to come straight to his office. </i>

388
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,460
<i> What's going on? </i>

389
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,350
<i> Not only is Yugong here, </i>

390
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,940
<i> but these people seem to be here for him, too. </i>

391
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,450
<i> Why don't I just sneak out now? I'll contact him tonight. </i>

392
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,430
Is this an employee of your company as well?

393
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,500
Uh, this person is a family member of one of our employees.

394
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,280
<i>Why do I have the feeling of being caught eloping?</i>

395
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,100
<i>Director Fang, please come in.</i>

396
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,690
Okay.

397
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,270
Director Fang, this way, please.

398
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,570
Weiwei Junior, are you eloping right now?

399
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,730
Eloping? I'm clearly performing an act.

400
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,350
This performance of yours really hits people on the head.

401
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,280
- President Xiao.
- Director Fang, sorry to keep you waiting.

402
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,440
It was us who came without notice.

403
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,890
Director Fang, our audio room has the best equipment.

404
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,870
Let's watch it over there.

405
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,830
Okay, let's go.

406
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,630
Come with me.

407
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,120
<i> Master is so calm.</i>

408
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,710
<i> It didn't surprise him at all. </i>

409
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,690
<i> And he's walking so fast. </i>

410
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,050
<i> Is he in a hurry to settle me down so that he can attend to his guest? </i>

411
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,300
<i> Even though it's the right thing to do,</i>

412
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,970
<i> he should have welcomed me with a little enthusiasm. </i>

413
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,250
<i>It's all right even if just verbally.</i>

414
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,320
<i>♫ Rain drips on my jacket ♫</i>

415
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,870
<i>♫ Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes ♫</i>

416
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,420
<i>♫ The signal you gave me, a smile ♫</i>

417
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,030
<i>♫ Came at just the right time ♫</i>

418
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,620
<i>♫ As I pass by you, the tips of your hair ♫</i>

419
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,230
<i>♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫</i>

420
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,620
<i>♫ Romance is fermenting. For you, ♫</i>

421
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,380
<i>♫ I'm willing to chase away all the troubles ♫</i>

422
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,830
<i>♫ I want to take you to the ends of the earth ♫</i>

423
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,620
President Xiao, it's improper to make others wait too long in the meeting room.
<i>♫ I want to listen to your heartbeat ♫</i>

424
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,910
Okay?
<i>♫ I want to give you a hug ♫</i>

425
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,790
<i>♫ And make the whole world know ♫</i>

426
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,290
<i>♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫</i>

427
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,680
<i>♫ No one else can feel your sweetest smile ♫</i>

428
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,500
<i>♫ I don’t need to look for anyone else ♫</i>

429
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,390
The food on the plane was too awful to swallow.
<i>♫ And make the whole world know ♫</i>

430
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,630
Wait for me here.
<i>♫ Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me ♫</i>

431
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,020
<i>♫ Only we know how beautiful our love is ♫</i>

432
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,640
<i>♫ I want to be around you every minute and every second ♫</i>

433
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,160
<i>♫ You are so important to me ♫</i>

434
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,620
<i>♫ You are so important to me ♫</i>

435
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,570
<i> How could I wait for him here? </i>

436
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,030
<i> Wouldn't I be too obedient? </i>

437
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,630
No, I should run away.

438
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,660
<i> It's not good for me to run away like this, right?</i>

439
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,030
<i> This kind of thing... Isn't this kind of thing very normal? </i>

440
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,670
<i> If I run away like this, he'll laugh at me. </i>

441
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,000
Hello, are you Miss Wei?

442
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,590
This is your take-out order. I've delivered it to you.

443
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,070
Thank you for your patronage. It's exactly ¥20.
<i>(Note: Approx. $3 USD)</i>

444
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,530
<i> Take-out? Did Master order this? </i>

445
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,550
Okay.

446
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,630
This... Miss, do you have any change?

447
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,490
It's like this. I happen not to have any change.

448
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,030
Could I get some change from your colleagues?

449
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,870
Why don't we do this? I'll go back to the store with you to get change.

450
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,660
Isn't that too troubling for you?

451
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,140
It's fine. It's fine. I don't want to stay here anyway.

452
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,770
What?

453
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,650
Nothing, nothing. Wait for me here. I'm going to leave a message.

454
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,790
In fact, she could have put it on her tab. This young lady was so worried.

455
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,150
President Xiao's knowledge in the area of music

456
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,270
is even more profound than I imagined.

457
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,600
I never thought that even with something I'm personally very satisfied with,

458
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,220
you could find faults in it.

459
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,220
We all hope the product will be as perfect as possible.

460
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,250
Of course.

461
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,730
But I am confident you will be satisfied next time.

462
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,750
I'm looking forward to it.

463
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,500
Nice working with you.

464
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,790
Promise you'll be satisfied...

465
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,600
Satisfied?

466
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,960
I find that people, when confronting the unknown,

467
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,190
are filled with curiosity.

468
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,150
Hey, will you die if you don't annoy me for a day?

469
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,770
<i> Thank you for your beef rice. </i>

470
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,890
<i>However, I don't have spare change, and he couldn't put it on the tab,</i>

471
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,950
<i> so I went to pay at the store. </i>

472
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
So you ran away.

473
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,880
And you gave such a lame excuse, too.

474
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,000
Hello?

475
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,870
Where are you?

476
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,380
I'm cleaning at Xiao Ling's house.

477
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,560
I can't live at school, so I'm borrowing her place to stay for a while.

478
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,350
Address?

479
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,390
Are you coming over? Let's talk later.

480
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,590
I'm cleaning right now and it's dirty.

481
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,110
I'll come over to find you.

482
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,250
No need. You're too high-profile. I can't afford you.

483
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,660
Weiwei, are you embarrassed?

484
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,680
Bao Gui Garden, building A, 1601.

485
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,330
Bring two bottles of juice when you come.

486
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,530
Go to clean the kitchen.

487
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,350
Don't come out until it's cleaned.

488
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,140
Here.

489
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,050
Thanks for the juice.

490
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,630
Thanks for your hard work!

491
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,650
