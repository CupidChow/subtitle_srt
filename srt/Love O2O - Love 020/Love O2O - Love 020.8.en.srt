00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,540
<i>♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫</i>

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,520
<i>♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫</i>

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,580
<i>♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫</i>

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,670
<i>♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫</i>

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫</i>

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,510
<i>♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫</i>

00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,560
<i>♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫</i>

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,180
<i>♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫</i>

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,680
<i>♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫</i>

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,710
<i>♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫</i>

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,840
<i>♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫</i>

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,850
<i>♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫</i>

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,230
<i>♫ So this is what love looks like ♫</i>

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,990
<i>♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫</i>

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,210
<i>♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫</i>

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,960
<i>♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫</i>

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,260
<i>♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫</i>

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,150
<i>♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫</i>

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,210
<i>♫ I want to travel to all four corners [of the earth] with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫</i>

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,280
<i>♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫</i>

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,420
<i>♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫</i>

<i>[Episode 8]</i>

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,080
This... is...

27
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,820
Don't look.

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,720
Give it back to me.

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,910
So it's Yixiao Naihe?

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,470
Sister Weiwei, I discovered that you are really love-struck.

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,560
Last time when I brought up Xiao Nai, your eyes also lit up.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,470
You have the same reaction for Yixiao Naihe.

33
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,020
That's not the same.

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,580
Xiao Nai is the model for my career.

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,900
I admire him.

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,620
As for Yixiao Naihe...

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,530
What does Yixiao Naihe mean to you?

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,610
A good friend.

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,600
Why can't we watch the points game?

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,230
Don't tell me we single guys can only helplessly play by ourselves outside.

41
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,650
The game definitely wants to make money off the couples.

42
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,670
That's why they have such a nasty trick.

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,070
Xiaoyu Yaoyao's gang has arrived.

44
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,290
Hey, that little guy is staring at me.

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,660
I really ought to pray for Xiaoyu Yaoyao and Zhenshui Wuxiang.

46
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,110
Just whose side are you on?

47
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,250
I'm praying that they run into Third Brother in the first match.

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,250
That's more like it.

49
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,010
<i>It would be best if we don't have to battle Xiaoyu Yaoyao in the first round.</i>

50
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,200
<i>It's almost time. Let's enter the arena.</i>

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,680
<i>Okay.</i>

52
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,920
Houzi, hand me the remote control.

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,220
Yugong really could become a fortune teller or a psychic.

54
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,660
For the Couple's PK Competition, the first round begins.

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,610
You have three minutes to prepare.

56
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,480
I'll dispose of Xiaoyu Yaoyao first.

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,220
Xiaoyu Yaoyao's strength is the weakest. Her specialty is a healer.

58
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,180
If you take her on, she won't even have a chance to fight back.

59
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,040
It's clear the best way for you is to take her out. This will be the quickest way to end it.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,170
However, I wonder whether Xiaoyu's clan would use this as an excuse to raise havoc that

61
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,570
you bully a helpless woman.

62
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,050
Do I need to offer an explanation when I take her out?

63
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,660
Okay, then let's get started.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,720
We'll just do it for fun.

65
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,950
Oh, wait a second.

66
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,710
Why don't you back me up and I'll fight on my own? If I can't handle it then you can join in.

67
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,840
Did they just run away?

68
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,150
Just as you saw.

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,940
The first time we participate in the Couple's PK Competition, yet we encountered an opponent who fled!

70
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,110
Are we that frightening?

71
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,650
It's definitely my wife who is more frightening.

72
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,710
In the first match of the points game, Yixiao Naihe

73
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,510
and Luwei Weiwei win in a complete victory, receiving three points.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,630
The second match of the Couple's PK Competition is starting.

75
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,410
Preparation time is three minutes.

76
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,570
Why is it someone we know again?

77
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,040
Diemeng Weixing was the leader of my guild before.

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,620
We were good friends before,

79
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,150
but later Diemeng stopped playing.

80
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,810
She turned over the command of the guild to Zhan Tianxia.

81
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,760
Weiwei, I didn't realize I'd run into you.

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,020
Such a coincidence.

83
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,520
Diemeng, you've returned.

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,450
Yes, I'm back.

85
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,630
It's such a lively competition. Of course, I must be here.

86
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,300
The second match of the points game now officially starts.

87
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,350
In the second match of the points game, Yixiao Naihe and

88
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,270
Luwei Weiwei win in a complete victory, receiving three points.

89
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,180
Weiwei, do you have time to chat?

90
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,920
Okay.

91
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,530
<i>Do you still remember that we met here?</i>

92
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,910
<i>At that time, I had a quest to kill an elite monster, but I couldn't defeat him.</i>

93
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,810
<i>I was going to die once again.</i>

94
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,320
<i>You suddenly dropped out of the sky and joined my group.</i>

95
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,260
<i>At that time, I also needed to complete my mission.</i>

96
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,870
<i>Back then, everyone was so happy, leveling up everyday, going to dungeons and discovering new territories.</i>

97
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,750
<i>I fully understand what happened last time,</i>

98
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,490
<i>and I scolded Tianxia.</i>

99
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,910
<i>However, I still need to apologize to you.</i>

100
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,730
<i>Diemeng, that thing doesn't concern you. You don't have to apologize to me.</i>

101
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,490
<i>How could it not concern me?</i>

102
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,150
<i>After all, I was the one who turned over the guild to Tianxia.</i>

103
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,750
<i>I'm back now.</i>

104
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,850
<i>Weiwei, join the guild again. Okay?</i>

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,480
<i>I have a lot of exams coming up.</i>

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,130
<i>I don't want to use up too much energy playing games.</i>

107
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,350
<i>I just decided to take part in the Couple's PK Competition but forget about the rest.</i>

108
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,470
<i>Regarding certain matter, I heard that...</i>

109
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,610
<i>Are you talking about Xiaoyu Qingqing?</i>

110
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,930
<i>You knew?</i>

111
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,050
<i>Of course. Don't worry. I'll take care of her.</i>

112
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,330
<i>She won't be able to undermine my relationship with Tianxia.</i>

113
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,710
<i>I never told you, but in the real world, we are actually a couple.</i>

114
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>Otherwise, why would I turn the guild over to him?</i>

115
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,890
<i>I see. That's good.</i>

116
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,350
<i>In the blink of an eye, June is here already.</i>

117
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,450
<i>Soon, our seniors will be leaving the school.</i>

118
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,610
<i>They'll rush on to their next journey.</i>

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,090
The game has reached the finals of this server as well. It's today.

120
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm just such an all-around expert,

121
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,330
wise in judgment as well as skillful in fighting.

122
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,200
Bei Weiwei, I originally planned

123
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,600
to treat you to hotpot after my CET-6 Exam.
<i>(Note: College English Test level)</i>

124
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,750
Based on what I see, it appears that I can save my money now.

125
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,630
Xiao Ling... Xiao Ling, would you like something to drink?

126
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,980
Ingest some MP <i>(magic potion)</i> and become the omnipotent little Tinker Bell.

127
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,810
So nauseating. Okay, okay. Just go to finish your competition.

128
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,370
Then... is the hotpot still there?

129
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,280
Yes.

130
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,150
<i>Why haven't Diemeng Weixing and Zhan Tianxia shown up yet?</i>

131
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,380
<i>It wasn't easy to get here to see the final round.</i>

132
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,680
Could they be late?

133
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,340
It couldn't be that they are not coming, could it?

134
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,170
Could it be because they lost the points match before? Now, they're in the finals and have to fight Luwei Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe again.

135
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,430
Could it be that they are scared and dare not show up?

136
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,040
<i>It can't be.</i>

137
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,170
<i>You can lose the game but not your reputation.</i>

138
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,910
<i>Exactly.</i>

139
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,110
The Couple's PK Competition on the Stormy Capital Server is about to start.

140
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,090
Preparation time is three minutes.

141
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,100
Why aren't they here yet?

142
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,360
When the preparation time of three minutes is up, they'll be disqualified.

143
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,630
<i>Fate brings us together and drives us apart. The relationship begins at times yet ends some other times.</i>

144
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,070
<i>Diemeng Weixing and Zhan Tianxia have broken off their relationship.</i>

145
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,010
<i>They've announced to annul their relationship as a couple.</i>

146
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,410
<i>Henceforth, if they meet again, neither will have any attachment for the other.</i>

147
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,450
Well, shoot! If you were going to break up, why didn't you do it earlier?

148
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,810
We've paid to watch this!

149
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,240
For the Final of the Couple's PK Competition, Yixiao Naihe and Luwei Weiwei win,

150
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,690
receiving First Place in the Couple's PK Competition of Stormy Capital,

151
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,370
and are eligible to participate in the elimination round for the entire region.

152
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,820
They'll represent this home server,

153
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,630
and have fierce battles with winners of other servers.

154
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,850
- Let's go.
- I'm going to find Leishen Nini and ask about the situation.

155
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,640
You can go find Yugong and the others.

156
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,200
Okay.

157
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,210
Weiwei, you are here.

158
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,100
Nini, I sent a message to Diemeng but she muted me

159
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,220
- and the message can't be sent over.
- I can't send any, either.

160
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,670
I asked people in the Guild. Again, it's because of Xiaoyu Qingqing, that wench.

161
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,420
Right now, everyone in world chat is discussing this.

162
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,880
It seems to be because Guild Leader Diemeng wanted to drive Xiaoyu Qingqing out of the guild,

163
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,770
but after Zhan Tianxia didn't agree, so they got into a fight.

164
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,370
This Xiaoyu clan! Why do they always do these kinds of things?

165
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,650
Couple's PK Competition semi-finals: Yixiao Naihe

166
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,610
and Luwei Weiwei win, qualifying now for the all-server grand finals.

167
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,460
They will compete for the title of Grand Champion of the all-server final tomorrow night.

168
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,860
Bring out the rose petals. Tomorrow, you'll take the Grand Championship.

169
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,970
Third Brother will be treating us.

170
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,740
Qualifying for the finals doesn't mean you'll become the champions, right?

171
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,680
You'll definitely get it. Have some confidence in yourself, okay?

172
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,740
I've looked into it. While your opponents are pretty good,

173
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,590
their luck isn't very good. You two happen to have the skill to counter their specialty.

174
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay, then. Tomorrow, I'll eat a little more,

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,660
so I can have more energy to fight. Will that be all right then?

176
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,860
Naihe?

177
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,800
Third Brother just left to take a phone call.

178
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,170
He's back.

179
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,920
<i>Weiwei, tomorrow I have a business dinner. I may come a little later.</i>

180
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,790
<i>Okay. Then I'll come a little later, too.</i>

181
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,270
<i>7:30 p.m. at the latest.</i>

182
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,880
<i>Okay.</i>

183
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,910
They're definitely in private chat.

184
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,420
<i>Hello? Shaoxiang,</i>

185
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,510
<i>Qingqing is complaining about us again; about how we didn't fight against Luwei Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe.</i>

186
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,540
<i>Now, they've already become the server champions and are participating in the grand final.</i>

187
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,840
So what if we let them become the server champions?

188
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,870
In reality, they're still losers.

189
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,880
Don't be unhappy. Honey, I love you.

190
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,260
I'm not unhappy. It's Qingqing who's unhappy.

191
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,240
Say, that Luwei Weiwei is really something. No matter what, Qingqing is still a girl.

192
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,250
How could she treat her this way?

193
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,260
Not every woman is softhearted and kind like you.

194
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,680
Yaoyao, I'm really lucky.

195
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,610
- Call me hubby.
- Hey, annoying.

196
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,340
This weekend, I'll take you to eat Japanese. Okay?

197
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,460
Okay.

198
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,820
I also want to go shopping.

199
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,610
Shopping? Okay.

200
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,410
Then I'll buy you all the clothes and bags you like, okay?

201
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,080
Oh, Shaoxiang, there you go again. I'm not with you because of these things.

202
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,260
Fine, I understand. I was wrong.

203
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,550
Another call's come in. I'll call you in a bit.

204
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,210
Okay.

205
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,260
How is it?

206
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,050
<i>Manager, CEO Zhen is on the internal line.</i>

207
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,150
- Put him through.
<i>- Okay.</i>

208
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>Hello? Who were you calling? I've been calling your cell phone for ages.</i>

209
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,160
A young lady. Okay?

210
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,260
<i>You, you. When will you mature a little?</i>

211
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,170
<i>You've been in the office for a few days now. Have you settled in?</i>

212
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,850
Dad, you told me to come to the office every day.

213
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,720
Was it just to sign a few unimportant documents?

214
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,070
<i>Didn't I already tell you very clearly?</i>

215
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,980
<i>In the past, I let you play as you pleased.</i>

216
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,370
<i>Now, it's time to become more focused to learn how to manage a company.</i>

217
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,410
<i>Sooner or later, you will have to deal with all these one day.</i>

218
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,770
Learning to manage? I feel I come here everyday to practice my handwriting.

219
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,260
This time, the final exams are later than before.

220
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,850
I won't be able to come back until July.

221
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,610
I've bought the ticket already.

222
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,850
I ordered them myself online.

223
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,410
You don't have to come to the train station to pick me up. I can carry it myself.

224
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,770
Besides, it's not the weekend.

225
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,060
You guys have to work.

226
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,260
Okay. Bye-bye.

227
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,960
Good heavens, I received an email from Zhen Yi Technology.

228
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,790
Could it be?

229
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,360
Is this real? I've been hired!

230
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
Could there be a company willing to provide shelter for people like me?

231
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,210
Amazing.

232
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,500
Is it Zhen Yi Technology?

233
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,360
That's right. Have a look at your email inboxes.

234
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,370
I-I didn't receive it.

235
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,540
Me, neither. What about you, Weiwei?

236
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,090
Wait a second... I haven't.

237
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,640
None of you got it? Only I did?

238
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,830
This isn't rational.

239
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,440
- Refresh it again and see.
- I've already refreshed it several times.

240
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,070
Don't worry. Perhaps big companies have a delay in sending emails. We can't be sure.

241
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,390
This... Isn't it usually sent at once?

242
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,640
It's definitely sent at the same time.

243
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,680
Really only me?

244
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,740
Although it's a little unimaginable,

245
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,720
it seems this is the reality.

246
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,990
Save me. Considering what Erxi wore that day,

247
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,860
what kind of criteria does this company have for hiring?

248
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,120
I've said it before. You have to wear clothes that show your techie geek style

249
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,340
to express our deep sincerity.

250
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,670
At the time, you didn't believe me. Now, you've learned your lesson. Right?

251
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,020
Hang on. This isn't good. I don't have enough outfits of that style.

252
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,640
When I really start interning, I won't have enough to wear.

253
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,960
Come with me to buy some clothes, okay?

254
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,080
Okay. I'm also going to buy some normal clothes.

255
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,950
I'm going, too.

256
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,180
You guys go. I'm not going.

257
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,840
I have no interest in shopping for clothes.

258
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,370
- I'm going to fetch some water.
- Just treat it as exercising.

259
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,920
Staring at a computer every day isn't good for your health.

260
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,850
How do you have the nerve to talk about exercising?

261
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,050
Who is the one who asks me to help run and scan her card every morning?

262
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,470
Who is the one forgetting again to fetch water and asking me to bring it everyday?

263
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,570
Weiwei, aren't the clothes you're wearing right now from last year?

264
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,310
- Help me add some water.
- Sure.
- Why don't you buy some new ones?

265
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,490
It's fine as long as I have enough.

266
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,260
For a beauty like you saying something like that, it really is too disgraceful.

267
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,650
If you continue like this, sooner or later, you'll be kicked out of the school beauty ranking.

268
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,150
It's best to be kicked out. I always compete with others with what's inside me.

269
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,750
Stop rubbing salt in Weiwei's wounds. She never liked the beauty ranking.

270
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,370
Also, recently, they're really going over the top. They just published something like a risk ranking.

271
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,840
According to the voting, the risk index for our Weiwei stands on top,

272
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,480
making her the one most likely to cheat.

273
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,830
When did this happen?

274
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,720
Why didn't you all even tell me?

275
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,580
It's better not to know about these kind of things that you can't control yourself.

276
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,950
It's depressing. I wish I had the skill to hack and bring down the forum.

277
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,120
Enough, enough. Let's go shopping and relieve some stress.

278
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,700
I'm really not going. Tonight at 8:00 p.m. is the final for the game.

279
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,430
It's at 8:00 p.m., so what are you worrying about? It's only 5:00 p.m. right now.

280
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,150
First, we'll buy clothes and eat a meal. You can then come back and fight your battle.

281
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,940
Bei Weiwei, if you dare not come,

282
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,320
you'll get capital punishment tonight!

283
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,740
If you don't come, who'll bargain for the prices? Come, okay?

284
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,430
This is your real aim for asking me to come, right? I'll go. I'll go.

285
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,130
<i>Welcome. Please, come in.</i>

286
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,430
Why do I have to help you guys carry the bags?

287
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,850
Who told you not to buy anything yourself? You can only be our assistant.

288
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,730
Somehow, I am recently destined to be the assistant,

289
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,820
even in the game.

290
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,230
Master Naihe now likes giving me chores more and more.

291
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,120
Enough, stop grumbling.

292
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,260
Since you helped me haggle so much today,

293
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,670
as the mogul, I'll treat you guys to the Red Wine Chicken Wing at the Tianxiangju restaurant.

294
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,950
- This is fine, right?
- I've worked hard and deserved merit. I want half the chicken wings.

295
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,930
- No problem!
- I'll give them all to you. I'm not going to fight with you. I'm on a diet.

296
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,780
I can't gain weight. Let it all come to me.

297
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,280
Xiao Ling, close the door. Send Erxi to bite her!

298
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,240
Huh?

299
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,850
- Isn't that Xiao Nai?
- I'm very pleased about our chat today.

300
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,450
I hope we'll meet again next time.

301
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,550
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

302
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,790
What are they doing?

303
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,150
He's so handsome!

304
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,580
Quickly, catch up to him!

305
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,410
He's looking over here!

306
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,120
Just now, was he looking at me? Was he looking at me?

307
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,380
Did you see it? Did you see it?

308
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,880
Why didn't we come here sooner?

309
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Otherwise, perhaps we could have had dinner together with Xiao Nai.

310
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,300
Stop dreaming.

311
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,740
The folks with Senior Xiao are all business people.

312
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,280
When they discuss business, they surely would use a private room.

313
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,590
I don't care anymore. Let me tell you something.

314
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,030
Senior Xiao's company seems to have run into a problem.

315
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,160
- No way!
- I heard it from Da Zhong.

316
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,270
There is a teammate on Da Zhong's basketball team who has worked at Senior Xiao's company ever since graduation.

317
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,860
Was it the day before yesterday? He was having a drink with him.

318
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,170
He had too much to drink and it slipped out.

319
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,890
They've run into some issue with investors.

320
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,500
And it just happened in the last few days.

321
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,750
I still don't really believe it. It's Xiao Nai!

322
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,750
If you call an amazing, formidable person a bull,

323
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,740
then Xiao Nao is a definitely a rare bull.

324
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,020
A rare bull means there are few like it, and they are rarely seen!

325
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,960
Is there anything he can't resolve?

326
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,530
In terms of investors? Then it's an issue with financing.

327
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,710
I'm not sure.

328
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,660
I can't guarantee how accurate it is.

329
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,930
However, even if this is false, none of you can talk about it.

330
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,050
I promise not to tell. I'll digest it along with the food we're about to eat.

331
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,520
Let's not talk about this. I've nearly starved to death. Let's hurry and go in.

332
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,810
Let's hope we can all successfully pass our CET-6 <i>(College English Test - 6)</i> Exam,

333
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,390
and from there make our way to the peak of life!

334
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,370
- Let's go!
- Time to eat!

335
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,000
Your prediction was completely accurate.

336
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,430
They were the fox pulling the flower stem, blocking our financing.
<i>(Note: He misuses the Chinese idiom)</i>

337
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,990
They were pulling logs from beneath the kettle.
<i>(Note: Chinese idiom that refers to the tactic of weakening the enemy by removing its resources)</i>

338
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,780
Yes, that's right.

339
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,550
My use of this idiom sounded like the real thing!

340
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,580
I've improved, huh?

341
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,750
Fortunately, we have plenty of options. Third brother,

342
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,270
when are you going to Shanghai to have a chat with Feng Teng?

343
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,010
There's no rush.

344
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,330
Oh, right! The one we just saw on the other side of the street was the beauty queen of our department.

345
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,440
Don't you think I've been having pretty good luck meeting girls lately?

346
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
I've bumped into her quite a few times lately.

347
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,890
Do you think maybe something's going to happen?

348
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,910
Even if something does happen, it wouldn't have anything to do with you.

349
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,150
Can't you let me dream a little?

350
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,420
To be honest, it's all right if it's not the beauty queen of the department.

351
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,740
After all, I will be a fully contributing member of society soon.

352
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,130
I'll have on a suit and leather shoes, then going to China Joy
<i>(Note: China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference)</i>

353
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,050
to attend some lectures, and maybe I'll attract a model!

354
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,610
Watch out!

355
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,510
Gosh, Weiwei, why were you in such a hurry?

356
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,790
I'm almost late! I have a match!

357
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,300
I really can't stand you. Didn't you say it started at 8:00 p.m.?

358
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,990
We agreed to meet at 7:30 p.m. I can't be late!

359
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,430
<i>Thankfully, I made it in time!</i>

360
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,900
<i>Luwei Weiwei, you're here! Where's Yixiao Naihe?</i>

361
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,300
<i>You must win! We support you!</i>

362
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,210
<i>Weiwei! I've bought a ticket, too! I heard that if you win, you get some of the profit from ticket sales!</i>

363
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,870
I'm going to use the bathroom!

364
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,980
- No, I need it. I need it!
- Me, first!
- Rock-paper-scissors! Whoever wins, she gets to go first!

365
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,180
<i>That's right! Whether it's for our server or for making money for yourself, you have to win!</i>

366
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,010
<i> Thank you. We'll do our best.<i></i></i>

367
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,010
<i> Thanks for everyone's support. <i></i></i>

368
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,540
- What happened?
- There's been a multi-car accident.

369
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,810
A truck malfunctioned and ran into quite a few cars.

370
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,630
All the wounded have been sent to our hospital.

371
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,610
- What is the patient's heart rate?
- Heart rate is 56 bpm, blood pressure is 150/110.

372
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,930
- Send him to Room One immediately and get an MRI.
- All right!

373
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,670
- Doctor, is my classmate all right?
- Hey, mister.

374
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,000
Please be patient and wait for the examination results. We will inform you immediately once we have them.

375
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,300
We need to examine other patients as well. Can you please cooperate?

376
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,010
<i>Why is Master not here yet?</i>

377
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,340
<i>He's never been late.</i>

378
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,190
<i>Are you there?</i>

379
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,660
<i>Surely Yixiao Naihe wouldn't be late?</i>

380
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,380
<i>How can he be late to such an important match?</i>

381
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,090
<i>There are ten minutes left. What's there to worry? The top players all show up at the last minute!</i>

382
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,180
Here.

383
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,760
Here!

384
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,890
Thanks.

385
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,620
<i>- Only a few minutes left. Why isn't he here?
- Could he have decided not to come? </i>

386
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,970
<i>No way. Are we going to have a repeat of "Zhan Tianxia - Die Meng scenario?"</i>

387
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,300
<i>Is this pair going to break up, too?</i>

388
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,050
<i>What is up with the fengshui on our server?</i>

389
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,820
<i>Doesn't seem like it. If they're breaking up, why would Luwei Weiwei still be standing here?</i>

390
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,710
<i>Don't tell me Luwei Weiwei has been dumped again?</i>

391
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,050
<i>Can you stop making baseless nonsense?</i>

392
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,360
<i>Maybe something's held him up.</i>

393
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,900
<i>I'll wait for you at the NPC's entrance.</i>

394
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,770
<i>Just come directly there.</i>

395
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,120
<i>That player is not online. You are unable to refresh his status.</i>

396
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,320
<i>Weiwei, what's going on?</i>

397
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,770
<i>Why don't you give Yixiao Naihe a call?</i>

398
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,230
<i>He's not really going to miss this, is he?</i>

399
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,620
<i>It's not eight yet, Naihe will definitely be here.</i>

400
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,490
Where's our Third Brother?

401
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,170
What happened? Say something!

402
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,670
They're trying to save him in the emergency room now.

403
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,110
His life is not in danger, right?

404
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,900
I don't know.

405
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,590
Third Brother was unconscious when he went in.

406
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,100
There was blood on his face.

407
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,160
It's my fault.

408
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,080
Why was I chatting with him while driving?

409
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,480
Why didn't I see it when the big truck came at us?

410
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,270
It's all my fault.

411
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,390
Why am I not the one lying in there?

412
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,220
Calm down. There's no use doing that.

413
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,130
When he comes out...

414
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,380
he's too evil, so there is no way anything could happen to him.

415
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,990
<i>Due to Yixiao Naihe and Luwei Weiwei's forfeit,</i>

416
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,860
<i>the prize for the Couple's PK competition goes to</i>

417
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,830
<i>Gaogao Shanshang Youmeinu and Anni Ka from the Raging Golden Sands server.</i>

418
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:39,440
<i>What is this? I thought we'd see an exciting PK fight tonight. Are they toying with us?</i>

419
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,580
<i>Forget it! I'm depressed already.</i>

420
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,900
<i>Never mind that. Luwei Weiwei is pretty pitiful, too.</i>

421
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,380
<i>How is she pitiful?! Use the toilet but not pooping.</i>
<i>(Note: a vulgar analogy for leaving people in suspense)</i>

422
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,160
<i>If she wasn't going to compete, why didn't she withdraw sooner? Now, she's basically given the prize to another server.</i>

423
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,850
<i>What are you saying? Why don't you think this way?</i>

424
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,690
<i> If it wasn't for Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe, </i>

425
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,150
<i>our server may never have made it to the final.</i>

426
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,070
<i> Weiwei, don't listen to their nonsense. </i>

427
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,540
Poor Luwei Weiwei! She's like a puppy that lost her master! She ran away with her tail between her legs.

428
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,830
Let's see how she's going to show off later!

429
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,800
Hasn't she been dumped by two men now?

430
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,890
Qingqing, we'll have to call you "Goddess of Curses" from now on.

431
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,090
You've said Yixiao Naihe was going to toss Luwei Weiwei aside,

432
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,720
and it came true!

433
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,960
I almost feel some sympathy for her.

434
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,370
Wenches will have their comeuppance. I'm so happy right now.

435
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,450
The reason Yixiao Naihe didn't come

436
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,270
is probably because he saw through her true colors.

437
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,500
What true colors?

438
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,850
Zhenshui told me about it.

439
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,370
Last time, didn't she say she was rich,

440
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,120
and wouldn't sell that Seven-Colored Garment?

441
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,920
- In real life, her family's actually very poor.
- Is that right?

442
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,210
Yaoyao, how do you know?

443
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,510
She applied to Zhenshui's company and said she would like to be an intern there.

444
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,900
Zhenshui also happened to hear that her ID was Luwei Weiwei.

445
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,270
Really? How does she look?

446
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,020
I've never personally seen her,

447
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,690
but Zhenshui said, "Not very good-looking."

448
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,100
So very ugly then?

449
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,560
Yaoyao, when should we go to Zhenshui's company to check out Luwei Weiwei?

450
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,790
That's right!

451
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,250
I want to slap her face in person!

452
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,380
Huh? Sure.

453
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,140
Cheers!

454
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,630
<i>[Working. Do not open the door.]</i>

455
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,270
Doctor, how is he?

456
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,670
Why hasn't Xiao Nai come out yet?

457
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,250
It can't be! It just can't be!

458
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,870
That's right... It can't be.

459
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,820
Th-Third Brother is too evil,

460
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,300
he-he's too evil.

461
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,850
It can't be. I don't believe it.

462
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,360
I don't believe it.

463
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Weiwei, what is it? Is the competition over?

464
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,480
It can't be. That fast?

465
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,830
Could it be that your opponent ran off again?

466
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,850
I'm going to get freshened up.

467
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,300
<i>Weiwei, tomorrow, I have a business dinner. I may come a little later.</i>

468
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,730
<i>Okay. Then I'll come a little later, too.</i>

469
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,330
<i>7:30 p.m. at the latest.</i>

470
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,930
<i>Okay.</i>

471
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,220
What's with her?

472
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,840
Something doesn't feel right.

473
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,740
Could she have lost the PK?

474
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,630
It's not worth it. It's just a game.

475
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,340
Let me ask her.

476
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,770
Don't ask her. What if she really lost?

477
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,450
If you ask, she'll feel even worse.

Save me!

499
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,050
I can't run anymore!

500
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,050
Weiwei!

501
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,050
- I can't run anymore!
- Faster, faster.

502
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,600
I can't go on.

503
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,650
Weiwei! You've already run so many laps!

504
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,990
It is enough to swipe the card a hundred times.

505
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,860
She wants to kill me. What is wrong with her?

506
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,840
Is it possible because we are going to have exams soon?

507
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,100
She becomes a little monster whenever it about time for exams.

508
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,920
Normally, she is only a self-study little monster,

509
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,190
so why is she a little running monster this time?

510
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,820
Stop guessing. I think it has something to do with the game.

511
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,190
Lately, she hasn't been playing her game.

512
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,760
She never plays games before exams.

513
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,550
She is scared that if she plays her game, she will lose her scholarship.

514
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,720
Without the scholarship, she won't have the money to buy the practice exams for the CET-6 Exam in the next semester.

515
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,610
Sounds about right. I can't take it anymore.

516
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,580
I am not going to be her running buddy anymore.

517
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,270
I am going to the dining hall. Anyone else want to come?

518
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,820
- I will go.
- I will go.

519
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,850
Let go.

520
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,510
Old Xiao!

521
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,510
Third Brother, you are finally awake. If you didn't wake up, I was about to jump off the building.

522
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,360
You almost scared us to death this time.

523
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,070
Third Brother, now I realize what it's like to be scared witless.

524
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,990
On the day when you were being examined,

525
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,290
a doctor came out and shook his head towards us.

526
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,350
At that moment, my mind went blank from fear.

527
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:59,280
Why was it so serious when you didn't even go into the operating room?

528
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,560
Why did he keep shaking his head when everything was fine?

529
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,070
It is fine that you are awake.

530
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,010
The doctor said that as long as you wake up, then all will be fine.

531
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,300
How do you feel?

532
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,280
Oh, yeah. I will go to find the doctor now.

533
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,170
I'm fine. I don't feel any discomfort.

534
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,790
You don't have to worry.

535
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,240
How can we not worry? Why weren't you more careful when driving?

536
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,420
Auntie and Uncle, I am sorry.

537
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,770
I was the one driving the car.

538
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,290
And... when the accident happened, Third Brother even gave me a push.

539
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,240
Otherwise, I would have been the one laying here.

540
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,460
Kid, don't worry about it so much.

541
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,170
Nobody could have anticipated something like this.

542
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,530
Since he is awake now,

543
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,070
<i>One is bound to have good fortune after surviving a disaster.</i>

544
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,300
That's right.

545
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,250
I am going to call our relatives. They are all waiting on updates.

546
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,880
Hurry up and go.

547
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,040
Just stay in bed. Don't move.

548
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,630
Third Brother, are you really okay now?

549
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,960
Do you feel any dizziness? Are you all right everywhere else?

550
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,120
Let's do this. Look at me. Look at me!

551
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,510
What is one plus one?

552
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,360
249.

553
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,170
Huh? Something's wrong! I'll find the doctor!

554
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,670
Enough already. Calm down a bit.

555
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,980
The way Third Brother is acting means that he is fine now.

556
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,340
He knows that you're not even a "250."
<i>(Note: 250 is slang for a dummy)</i>

557
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,590
- What time is it?
-It is 5:00 p.m.

558
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,840
You guys go to log on to "A Chinese Ghost Story" and tell Weiwei about this.

559
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,690
- Third Sister-in-Law!
- At a time like this...

560
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,940
At a time like this, how can you be still thinking about the game?

561
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,780
Third Sister-in-Law?

562
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,980
Third Sister-in-Law couldn't have waited for you all night, right?
