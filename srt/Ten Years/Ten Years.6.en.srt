After graduation,

00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,140
we went our separate ways.

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,340
Today, we gather here again.

8
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,380
Let me ask, are you happy?

9
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,940
This hot-pot is spicy.

I don't know what you guys are thinking.

I'm happy to see Xuan anyway.

To be honest,

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,180
I really missed you all.

20
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,340
After you graduated,

I haven't seen you guys again.

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I just wanted to see

what you guys, the little troublemakers who used to fight back in the day,

into promising young adults.

26

He's not a promising young man. Not included.

Although I have nothing important to do,

28

what we live for in this life.

It's just that.

I ignored you.

144
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,700
But you waited for me every day.

145
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,700
My colleagues saw it.

146
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,460
I was so stupid to say yes.

Now you want to break up with me?

Are you a monster?

149
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,100
Yes, monster!

Yes, I'm a monster.

Aren't you worse than a monster?

Yes, he is worse than a monster!

156
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,140
I'm worse than a monster.

157
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,980
If you don't want to break up,

158
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,060
we won't break up, okay?

159
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,860
Back off!

160
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,180
I've asked around.

161
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
You have had tons of girlfriends

since you were in collage.

163
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,340
You have changed girlfriends so many times.

I'm not here today to ask you to get back together with me.

I'm not that cheap.

166

We're done.

167
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,180
We have nothing to do with each other anymore.

168
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,460
Then why did you ask us

169
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,420
to come here?

170
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,260
That's right!

171

Just come here!

172
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,100
We'll figure it out together.

173
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,780
You definitely don't want to get back together with him.

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,940
right?

176
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,850
Yes, yes.

177
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,700
I want you to do something.

178
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,860
If you don't agree,

179
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,300
I will kill myself.

180
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,690
No, no, no!

181
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,500
I'll do it.

182
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,460
I've sent you the letter of apology.

183
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,220
It's good that your friends are here.

184
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,180
Read it.

185
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,340
Ask your friend to film it for me.

186
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,980
Let's film it!

187
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,659
Let's film it!

188
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Send it to Lu Zirui.

189
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,740
And ask Lu Zirui to send it to the work group.

190
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,130
Read it!

191
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,020
I, Li Wenkai,

192
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,940
am an ill-behaved wealthy heir.

193
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,140
I've overestimated myself.

194
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,460
I always think I'm handsome.

195
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,300
Actually, I'm so ugly that it makes people want to vomit.

196
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,740
Stop laughing!

197
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,180
It's a matter of life and death. Don't laugh.

198
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,260
Louder. Film it again.

199
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,140
Okay, let's film it again.

200
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,460
Film again.

201
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:56,860
Don't laugh.

202
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,700
We won't.

203
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,180
Film again.

204
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,140
I, Li Wenkai,

205
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,100
am an ill-behaved wealthy heir.

206
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,100
I've overestimated myself.

207
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,180
I always think I'm handsome.

208
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,100
Actually, I'm so ugly that it makes people want to vomit.

209
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,700
I always think I'm talented,

210
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,140
but I'm actually a loser.

211
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Because my parents...

212
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,780
Wait.

213
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,740
I can apologize to you.

214
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,900
But it has nothing to do with my parents.

215
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,340
Will you read it or not?

216
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,060
Okay.

217
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,140
You don't want to apologize?

218
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,100
No, no, no!

219
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,900
I'll read.

220
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,340
I, Li Wenkai,

221
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,860
am an ill-behaved wealthy heir.

222
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,220
I've overestimated myself.

223
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,260
I always think I'm handsome.

224
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,780
Actually, I'm so ugly that it makes people want to vomit.

225
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,059
Guys, drink up.

226
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,020
Ranran, what are you doing?

227
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,860
I found that today,

228
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,820
the way you look at Chen Tao is different.

229
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,460
You said you have been writing a novel.

230
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,540
But actually, it's for meeting him,

231
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,260
right?

232
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,220
I really was writing a novel.

233
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
You've been busy.

234
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,180
You have no time to read my novel.

235
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,940
Liu Ke, which time have you ever successfully hidden your infatuation

236
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,020
from me since our freshman year till now?

237
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,140
I do have

238
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,020
a little,

239
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
little bit of crush on him.

240
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,620
What did you promised me in sophomore year? Say it!

241
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,180
I promise,

242
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,900
if I have any ambiguous relationship with any guy,

243
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
I will definitely inform Ranran

244
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,180
to avoid being deceived.

245
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,420
But Ranran,

246
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,140
there's nothing between us, really.

247
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,220
Except for talking about my novel,

248
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,180
we didn't talk about anything else.

249
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,940
Really?

250
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,500
Ke, if you found your true love,

251
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,020
I would be really happy for you.

252
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,340
But Chen Tao?

253
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,700
He is just a hooligan.

254
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,020
He's not a hooligan.

255
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,220
He graduated from a vocational college.

256
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,060
And he graduated only one year earlier than us.

257
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,020
Ke.

258
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,340
We've graduated from university.

259
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,940
Can you be realistic?

260
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,780
What is his job?

261
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,300
He runs a second-hand motorcycle shop.

262
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,540
What else can he do,

263
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,500
besides bragging?

264
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,340
Good speech.

265
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,980
What about your Lin Yicheng?

266
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,020
What do you mean by my Lin Yicheng?

267
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,540
Don't lie to me.

268
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,180
I saw him send you home several times.

269
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,100
And actually,

270
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,380
that fight he was involved,

271
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,700
is all because of you.

272
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,020
Because of me?

273
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,900
Tao told me.

274
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,140
Lin Yicheng got into the fight

275
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,900
because someone insulted you

276
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,860
and said very offensive things.

277
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,380
He said...

278
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,620
Actually, Cheng...

279
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,940
is not a very impulsive person.

280
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,180
Isn't it worth it?

281
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,460
Ke,

282
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,620
I do have a bit of crush on him.

283
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,500
I know he likes me too.

284
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,500
But we can't be together.

285
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,020
You can be together if you like each other.

286
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,500
Why do you have to make it so complicated?

287
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,220
Liking and being together are two different things.

288
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,980
You like him,

289
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,940
but you don't want to be with him.

290
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,500
Isn't that harming him?

291
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,540
Think about it.

292
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,340
Kai, to be honest,

293
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,980
although you are the biggest playboy in Chongqing,

294
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,420
I really admire you

295
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,380
when you were doing that for that girl.

296
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,060
To you.

297
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,420
You saved her.

298
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
And you also killed her.

299
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,220
But after all,

300
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,980
Saving a life is better than building a seven-level pagoda.

301
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,380
To you.

302
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,860
Although you're a scumbag,

303
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,700
you still have conscience. Here's to you.

304
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,540
It's not too bad. Here's to you.

305
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,500
How can you praise me with such words?

306
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,820
There are so many people raising a toast to you. Drink it.

307
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,740
Drink!

308
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,780
Those who understand me know that I'm deeply troubled.

309
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,740
People who don't understand me make me drink.

310
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,300
Let the storm come more fiercely!

311
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,100
Look.

312
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,420
This is called a dead pig is not afraid of hot water.

313
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes.

314
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,420
Yes.

315
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,900
Can you please not

316
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,180
put on an expression of being wronged?

317
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,940
Let me ask you.

318
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,740
Tell me the truth.

319
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,100
Have you ever thought about being with her?

320
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,220
I didn't think that far at first.

321
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,300
What about her?

322
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,620
I was drunk every night.

323
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,740
How would I know?

324
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,180
Then why did you give her an illusion?

325
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,420
You deserves it.

326
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,700
That's right.

327
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,420
OK.

328
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,460
From now on,

329
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,740
I will turn over a new leaf,

330
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,900
and never drink again.

331
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,180
Tao, listen,

332
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,260
don't ever go on a date with a good girl.

333
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,900
Okay.

334
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,020
It will be terrible once you do that.

335
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,930
I'll take you to a taxi.

336
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,020
-You can't drink. -Be careful.

337
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,420
You forgot his phone!

338
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,780
His phone!

339
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,820
You're indeed the God of Wine.

340
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,460
Look how drunk he is.

341
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,220
Why didn't you tell me why you fought?

342
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,740
You knew?

343
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,910
♫ In the dark sky ♫

344
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,480
♫ occasionally flicker ♫

345
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,780
Chen Tao really can't keep a secret.

346
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,660
I really...

347
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,260
♫ your deep eyes ♫

348
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,920
♫ When flowers fall ♫

349
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,660
I...

350
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,610
♫ I don't know where the relentless water flows ♫

351
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,860
Actually, I...

352
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,380
I was impulsive.

353
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,750
♫ The most beautiful scene is a rainbow on a sunny day ♫

354
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Besides, I don't think

355
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,860
you should know these words.

356
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,060
♫ around the world ♫

357
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,650
♫ Watching the kite quietly fly in the blue sky ♫

358
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,610
♫ I wish I could see you again ♫

359
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,670
♫I wish I could do it again ♫

360
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:53,100
♫ I wish I could have that day again ♫

361
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:02,490
♫ I've been thinking about the possibility ♫

362
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,060
♫ There's no need to say ♫

363
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,810
♫ I hope we can meet again ♫

364
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,790
♫ In the dark sky ♫

365
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,370
♫ occasionally flicker ♫

366
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,150
♫ your deep eyes ♫

367
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
♫ When flowers fall ♫

368
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,490
♫ I don't know where the relentless water flows ♫

369
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,630
♫ The most beautiful scene is a rainbow on a sunny day ♫

370
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,950
♫ around the world ♫

371
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,940
Tao, you really can drink.

372
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:45,540
♫ Watching the kite quietly fly in the blue sky ♫

373
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,100
I can keep drinking.

374
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,980
Wang Ran, I...

375
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,180
I know what you want to say.

376
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,900
Well...

377
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,260
Ranran, let's go back.

378
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,780
I gotta go.

379
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,380
Let's go.

380
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,700
Let's go.

381
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,180
Shandong Pancake.

382
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,020
Northeast steamed buns.

383
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,300
Once you take a bite,

384
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,860
your mouth will be full of meat.

385
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,340
Why do I feel like a trap?

386
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,900
I packed these myself.

387
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,500
How can it be called a trap,

388
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,300
Ke?

389
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,140
Ranran, just tell me.

390
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
Otherwise, I can't even eat properly.

391
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,660
I'll tell you then.

392
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,860
You have to listen to me.

393
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,700
Four reasons that you can’t be together with Chen Tao.

394
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,100
First, we need to consider his financial situation.

395
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,210
He doesn't have a house or a car.

396
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,060
Although we are not materialistic girls,

397
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,100
we still have basic conditions.

398
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,380
Second, his education background.

399
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,220
The vocational college he went to,

400
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,740
makes no different from that he didn't went to.

401
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,260
Third, his character.

402
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,780
He's full of nonsense.

403
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,780
He's obviously not a reliable person.

404
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,220
Fourth, the future.

405
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,700
What future can a hooligan

406
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,380
who fights every day have?

407
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
Am I right, Ke?

408
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,340
Okay.

409
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,540
The first speaker of the affirmative has a strong

410
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,860
and reasonable logical argument.

411
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,500
The negative, please make a statement.

412
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,100
OK.

413
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,260
I think

414
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,820
these are his strengths.

415
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,460
Look.

416
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,020
He has no house or car.

417
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,500
But we can make money together,

418
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,300
and work hard together, that's a nice thing.

419
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,180
He has a poor education background.

420
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,620
But he respects me.

421
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,500
I know he likes bragging.

422
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,100
But every time when he's bragging,

423
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,140
he's interesting.

424
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,780
And he's not a hooligan.

425
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,340
He runs a motorcycle shop.

426
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,780
He fights because he's chivalrous.

427
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,180
Chivalrous?

428
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,900
It seems that the first speaker of the affirmative

429
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,130
has been persuaded by me.

430
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,980
Let's eat.

431
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,300
Big buns.

432
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,780
Eat more.

433
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,940
You are easily fooled, just like a steamed bun.

434
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
It's delicious.

435
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,859
The buns are amazing.

436
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,500
Eat more.

437
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,020
Come on, let's eat.

438
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,339
Li,

439
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,859
I made a career plan.

440
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,660
Take a look.

441
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,690
If you're short of money, ask your mother for a quick transfer.

442
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Please take a look, okay?

443
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,460
Li, just take a look.

444
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,900
You can read it after dinner.

445
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,290
What do you mean?

446
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,180
Li Jianxun, what are you doing?

447
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,260
You can throw it away,

448
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,900
but can you take a look first?

449
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,170
Do I need to read it?

450
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,380
If it was Buffett's plan,

451
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,380
I wouldn't even need to read it.

452
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,420
I'll sign immediately.

453
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,140
A porter's plan,

454
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,260
no matter how beautiful it is,

455
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,180
do I want to see it? Does it worth it?

456
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,180
Am I a loser to you?

457
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,340
You're not a complete loser.

458
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,420
At least you know that you are a loser.

459
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,860
Li Jianxun, what are you doing?

460
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,020
You don't have to read

461
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,100
the career planning book that your son worked hard on,

462
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,340
but why throw it away?

463
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,900
A doting mother often spoils her child.

464
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,380
He is the way he is today

465
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,300
because of you.

466
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,740
Why are you blaming my mom?

467
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,860
What's wrong with my son?

468
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,980
Did he kill someone?

469
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,100
Or did he set fire?

470
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,780
I don't understand.

471
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,380
He is your son.

472
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,300
What did he do

473
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,660
to make you look down on him?

474
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,020
I, Li Wenkai.

475
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,900
Look.

476
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,460
An ill-behaved wealthy heir.

477
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,340
Due to parents' lack of manners,

478
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,380
and their poor upbringing,

479
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,980
I grew up self-centered

480
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,540
and lacked manners.

481
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,020
What...

482
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,020
Why...

483
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,460
No, mom.

484
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,380
I was trying to save someone.

485
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,780
That's why I...

486
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,180
Yes,

487
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,900
you was trying to save someone.

488
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
And you also want to save the whole world, the humanity?

489
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,180
I really was...

490
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,620
Stop!

491
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,340
I'm lack of manners?

492
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,500
Take a good look.

493
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,540
You spent the pocket money I gave you,

494
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,700
It's fine.

495
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,700
But now you're asking me to invest?

496
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,180
If I invest in his company,

497
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,460
I have no idea

498
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,060
how much trouble he might cause.

499
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,820
From now on,

500
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
don't mention words like investment

501
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,740
and planning to me!

502
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,370
Alright.

503
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,020
Eat first.

504
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,500
I can't eat anymore.

505
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
You have to eat something.

506
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,020
I made your favorite today.

507
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,460
Here.

508
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,660
What's the matter?

509
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,420
I don't want Ke

510
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,300
to have too much contact with Chen Tao.

511
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,660
Wang Ran, I think...

512
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,900
I know what you want to say.

513
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,180
As friends,

514
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,300
you don't think we should

515
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,130
interfere in their business.

516
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,620
Right?

517
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,180
But let me tell you,

518
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,380
Ke is a very innocent

519
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
and naive girl.

520
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
I've been doing this since college.

521
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,340
So that she didn't fall into the traps of some scumbags.

522
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm not saying that Chen Tao is a scumbag.

523
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,620
It's just that I am the person that Ke trusts the most.

524
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,380
We are not just classmates.

525
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
I treat her as my own sister.

526
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,660
I understand

527
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,900
what you said.

528
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,820
But as you can see,

529
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,660
they're getting along quite happily.

530
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,620
Yes, like 2 fools.

531
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,060
One brags and the other believes.

532
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,980
But love without material foundation

533
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,340
is just empty talk.

534
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,700
I know Chen Tao is a nice guy.

535
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,180
But if we were in college,

536
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,180
it's okay for them to start a relationship.

537
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,740
But now we're adults.

538
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,140
We should face the reality.

539
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,020
And as their friends,

540
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,340
I think we can remind them.

541
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,940
OK, I see.

542
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,180
I will talk to Chen Tao.

543
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,820
Let me send you back.

544
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,140
Let me ask you.

545
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,100
Tell me the truth.

546
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,660
Are you going to date Ke or not?

547
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,820
I'm going to do something big.

548
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,500
I will not date.

549
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,700
Tell me the truth.

550
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,220
Cut the nonsense.

551
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,860
Fine, I won't persuade you.

552
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,700
Think about it.

553
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,100
If you like her,

554
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,500
you should pursue her and date her.

555
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,780
If you don't like her,

556
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,180
just don't give her too much hope.

557
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,620
She'll be the one who gets hurt.

558
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,660
Lin Yicheng, what do you mean?

559
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,700
What do you mean?

560
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,060
For your own good.

561
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,780
A real man doesn't afraid to start and to end anything.

562
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,330
Understand?

563
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,940
What's wrong with you?

564
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,020
Liu Ke and I have always been friends.

565
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,660
She never expressed it.

566
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,020
Should I tell her,

567
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,940
Miss Liu Ke,

568
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
do you like me?

569
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,860
Should I say that?

570
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,420
I didn't mean that.

571
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,380
I mean,

572
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,700
you can ask in a more gentle way.

573
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,020
Hint, hint, understand?

574
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,540
What if she doesn't like me?

575
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,380
What if she doesn't have feelings for me?

576
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,180
How can we keep being friends?

577
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,940
Okay, friends.

578
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,020
You said friends.

579
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,500
Then keep a distance between friends.

580
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,420
Keep...

581
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,060
Dayu, are you sure he's back?

582
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,060
Yes.

583
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,260
Okay.

584
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,220
He has been hiding for two years, and now he dares to come back?

585
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,180
Then he has to give us an explanation.

586
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,460
Tao.

587
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,580
What are you doing here?

588
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,260
Nothing.

589
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,460
I just want to talk about the story with you.

590
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,860
What? You don't want to hear it?

591
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,980
I think your story is beyond reality.

592
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,020
I happen to have time today.

593
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,260
Let me show you what reality is.

594
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,420
Where's the money you owe me?

595
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,620
It's just a repair fee.

596
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,740
I don't have money at the moment. Let's talk about it when I have money.

597
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,500
I've been waiting for two years.

598
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,460
You should keep waiting.

599
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,980
I want it today.

600
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,620
How dare you!

601
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,460
How dare you ask for money? Aren't you afraid of getting beaten?

602
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm fine.

603
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,220
It's just a scratch.

604
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,460
Look how anxious you are.

605
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,060
Why do I need a CT scan?

606
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,220
Ke, I'm sorry.

607
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,100
It's okay.

608
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,060
Lin Yicheng, let's go buy some water.

609
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,780
Okay.

610
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,540
I'm really sorry.

611
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,340
Although I was scared,

612
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,980
it was still exciting.

613
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,900
Do you want some?

614
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,500
Good!

615
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,460
Tell me.

616
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,780
I asked Chen Tao.

617
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,780
He originally intended to scare Liu Ke,

618
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,940
but he didn't expect to hurt her.

619
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,940
He's not in the mood to date now.

620
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Not in the mood to date?

621
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,620
Then what is he doing with Liu Ke?

622
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,140
He's just...

623
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,940
What?

624
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,660
He is just a hooligan pretending to be a big boss.

625
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,780
He is poor,

626
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,900
and full of nonsense.

627
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,460
His words are completely untrustworthy.

628
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:07,780
Right?

629
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,380
Wang Ran.

630
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,980
My brother is poor,

631
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,340
but he's really a good guy.

632
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,620
Can you stop looking down on him?

633
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,740
Then what exactly has he done

634
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,180
to earn respect?

635
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,780
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

636
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,980
What's wrong with him?

637
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,780
He was reckless today,

638
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,020
but his intentions were good.

639
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,700
If he had good intentions, would Ke have been injured?

640
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,540
Whether they get together or not,

641
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,620
it doesn't matter.

642
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,980
As long as they are happy.

643
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,980
Why do you have to consider

644
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,380
so many practical issues?

645
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,580
Why not?

646
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,260
Okay, I understand.

647
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,660
What?

648
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,580
One should have self-awareness.

649
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,620
Wang Ran,

650
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
I understand.

651
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
I'll go buy some water.

652
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,010
[Are you busy? Do you have time?]

653
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,540
After that argument,

654
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,980
I cut off contact with her.

655
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,500
I understand that she was just worried about her best friend.

656
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,180
But she doesn't know,

657
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,380
the fight that Chen Tao started

658
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,180
was originally intended to make Liu Ke give up.

659
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,620
It was just an insecure boy,

660
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,540
absurdly showing his courage.
