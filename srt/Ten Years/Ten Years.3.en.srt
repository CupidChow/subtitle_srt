00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,140
Shame on you!

172
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,740
Since young,

173
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,980
I've done countless homework for you.

174
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,180
Have you ever thanked me?

175
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,300
How many times

176
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,540
have I fought for you?

177
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,540
From elementary school to high school,

178
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,140
who dared to provoke you?

179
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,820
It was all because me, your Papa, was protecting you.

180
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
How dare you mention the fight?

181
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,260
How many self-criticism letters

182
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,540
I've written for you?

183
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,060
You deserved it.

184
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,740
Let's go.

185
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,980
Perfect.

186
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,500
Ke, remember to have breakfast at home.

187
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,820
I'm going to work.

188
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,900
I don't want to.

189
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,180
I'm going to Lane.

190
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,010
[Lane Dry Mixed Minced Noodles Restaurant]

191
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,060
Hello, Mom.

192
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Hello, Ke, what are you doing?

193
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm having breakfast.

194
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,300
What are you eating?

195
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,660
Noodles.

196
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,740
How many bowls do you have?

197
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,500
Two bowls.

198
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,660
A bowl of green pepper noodles

199
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
and a bowl of eel noodles.

200
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
Why do you only have two bowls?

201
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,620
You have to have four bowls.

202
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,860
You should eat yourself into a pig.

203
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Then you'll look nice when you're standing there.

204
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,500
Fine.

205
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,460
Mom, I know.

206
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,380
Stop talking.

207
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,060
I'll eat less.

208
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,380
Who told you to eat less?

209
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,700
Seriously,

210
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,740
when will you come back?

211
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,940
Didn't I tell you?

212
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,370
I'll stay in Chongqing and look for opportunities first.

213
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,060
If it didn't work, I'll go back and take the civil service examination. Don't worry.

214
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,060
I should not worry?

215
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,740
Right.

216
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,500
Let's talk about it when I get into Babaoshan Cemetery.

217
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:09,860
Right?

218
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,620
Mom.

219
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,540
I never said I definitely won't go back.

220
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,540
Right.

221
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
You never said you were going to Mars either.

222
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,740
You'll make a stopover on your way to Mars

223
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,300
to visit home someday, right?

224
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,420
Fine.

225
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,420
I'm going to the interview.

226
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,300
I have to go.

227
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Bye.

228
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,540
My name is Xin Ya.

229
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,700
I also graduated from Xicheng University.

230
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,620
I was one year ahead of you.

231
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,500
I was from the Media Department.

232
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,660
Hello. Senior.

233
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,780
Don't call me Senior.

234
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,940
I've read your resume.

235
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,900
We're the same age.

236
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,300
You're two months older than me.

237
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,540
Our department is right ahead.

238
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,940
Let me introduce our colleagues to you.

239
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,140
This is our photographer.

240
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,820
Xiang.

241
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,780
Hello. Xiang.

242
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,340
Hello.

243
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,940
The post-production personnel.

244
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,500
Uncle Zhang.

245
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,260
Nice to meet you, Uncle Zhang.

246
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,220
Nice to meet you.

247
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,180
This is our new colleague, Lin Yicheng.

248
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,090
Your seat is over there.

249
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,060
Thank you.

250
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,690
The lives of the five of us

251
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,980
started like that.

252
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,220
I started a six-month internship

253
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,540
at the TV station.

254
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
Chen Tao continued to run his Sanxia motorcycle shop.

255
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,500
Wang Ran went to a real estate company.

256
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,020
Li Wenkai continued to be carefree.

257
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,260
He said

258
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,380
he's on his way to his dream.

259
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,780
Liu Ke joined a kindergarten as a teacher.

260
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
That's it.

261
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,500
Time flies.

262
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,780
It's almost the end of October.

263
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
New energy is the direction of future energy.

264
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,540
Mr. Zhu,

265
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,700
please take a look at our questions.

266
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,500
We'll start later.

267
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,140
Okay.

268
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,580
New energy is the direction of future energy development.

269
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
Lin Yicheng, where are you?

270
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,700
I'll be there soon.

271
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,820
Didn't I tell you?

272
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,860
I have a sore throat.

273
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,940
You'll do the interview today.

274
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,420
I'm already here.

275
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,020
Building C, Room 803?

276
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,540
Building D, Room 803.

277
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,820
You said it was Building C.

278
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,220
Forget it.

279
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,820
Come over quickly.

280
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,740
Okay.

281
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,860
Mr. Zhu, are you ready?

282
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,940
Almost done. Okay.

283
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,300
Let's get ready.

284
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,780
There's no time. Hurry up.

285
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,620
Okay.

286
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,980
Mr. Zhu, sorry.

287
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,540
Lin, stand on the right.

288
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,300
Okay.

289
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,820
Come on.

290
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,740
Okay.

291
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,580
Hello, Mr. Zhu.

292
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,099
Your company specializes in renewable energy.

293
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,819
I have a few questions for you.

294
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,460
What made you so confident

295
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,980
in the future of renewable energy?

296
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,180
New energy is the direction of future energy development.

297
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,619
It's undoubtedly true.

298
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,940
This is not only a matter of continuous development,

299
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,060
but also how our country

300
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,140
can overtake on a curve

301
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,940
in the energy field.

302
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,859
Traditional energies, such as oil...

303
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,859
Lin, come here.

304
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,580
What’s wrong, Uncle Zhang?

305
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,500
Look here. Where is the microphone logo?

306
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,260
The internship will end next week.

307
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,740
There're a total of five people

308
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
in your cohort.

309
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,500
In principle, we'll keep three out of five.

310
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,180
You've been doing well.

311
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,580
Of course you should stay.

312
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,740
But now you made

313
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,340
such a stupid mistake.

314
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,220
If you stayed,

315
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,220
how can I explain to those who will leave?

316
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,460
Mr. Fang, I won't find any excuse.

317
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,220
This comprehensive interview will be aired on Saturday.

318
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,820
It's Thursday. I still have time.

319
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,940
Please give me another chance.

320
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,940
I'll go to Mr. Zhu

321
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,780
for a reshoot of the video.

322
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,180
Mr. Zhu is very busy now.

323
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,260
Mr. Fang, I will make up for it.

324
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,460
Please trust me this time.

325
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,580
Okay, go ahead.

326
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,740
Okay.

327
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,420
Xiang.

328
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,460
Is this too much?

329
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,780
Wasn't it your idea?

330
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,260
You said you wanted to teach him a lesson.

331
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,580
I did want to teach him a lesson.

332
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,860
I just wanted him to be anxious.

333
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,420
I'll explain to the head later.

334
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,340
Hey, you bastard!

335
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,540
You got something on my clothes.

336
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,260
Again?

338
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,660
Are you blind?

339
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,260
Lick it clean for me.

340
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,700
Let me wash it for you.

341
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,220
Wash? Wash what?

342
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,180
I don't need you to wash it.

343
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,900
You don't have to lick it.

344
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,220
But you have to waive the repair fees for me.

345
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
The repair...

346
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,940
No way.

347
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,180
I've been working hard for a long time.

348
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,700
You should at least give me some money.

349
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Money? What money?

350
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,060
My clothes are free?

351
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,980
Damn you, fat boy!

352
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,860
Are you looking for trouble?

353
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,380
Close the door.

354
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,100
Hello.

355
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,580
I want to see Mr. Zhu.

356
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,100
What can I do for you?

357
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm from the TV station.

358
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,780
My name is Lin Yicheng.

359
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,620
I interviewed Mr. Zhu before.

360
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,780
We missed a few shots.

361
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,500
I want to reshoot them with him.

362
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,380
Is it convenient for him?

363
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,660
I'll tell him later.

364
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,260
But Mr. Zhu is having

365
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,380
a very important meeting.

366
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,660
He can't be disturbed right now.

367
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,980
Please wait a moment.

368
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,660
Okay, I can wait.

369
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,660
According to our management rules,

370
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,980
you can't wait here.

371
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,060
You have to go downstairs.

372
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,500
Okay, got it.

373
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,260
Well, please contact me

374
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,140
after Mr. Zhu

375
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,060
finishes the meeting.

376
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,860
No problem.

377
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,700
Thank you.

378
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,380
That tomboy.

379
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,500
Come out!

380
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,700
Who are you?

381
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,140
Tao, I caused the trouble.

382
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,900
Let me deal with it.

383
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,620
Don't move.

384
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,140
Tell me what happened.

385
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,580
What happened?

386
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
You want to know what happened?

387
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,620
Ask her.

388
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,460
He didn’t pay for repair.

389
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,340
Qiu and I gave him a beating.

390
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,220
You call that "a beating"?

391
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,060
You beat me up so badly that my own mother didn't recognize me.

392
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,300
You were insulting me.

393
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,140
I haven't insulted you enough.

394
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,860
Bro, you deserved it.

395
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,860
What did you say?

396
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,940
Bro.

397
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,860
Your people started it.

398
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
What?

399
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,580
Don't you know the rules?

400
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,860
What rules?

401
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,500
Since I'm here today,

402
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,580
you can't touch them.

403
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,620
What?

404
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,620
You beat my man up like this.

405
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,300
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

406
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,980
He bullied me first.

407
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,140
He bullied you first?

408
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,340
With your physique,

409
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,740
even I can't bully you.

410
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,540
How could he bully you?

411
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,740
Tell me. What do you want?

412
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,100
Okay.

413
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,860
Here's the thing.

414
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,140
You will be beaten to the same extent

415
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,740
as he was beaten.

416
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,620
Grab your weapons.

417
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,460
What are you doing?

418
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,540
Okay.

419
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,380
Young man.

420
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,780
You're tough.

421
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,380
Let's go.

422
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,220
Hua.

423
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,700
Are we leaving like this?

424
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,140
They hit me.

425
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,260
Let me ask you.

426
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,020
You didn't even pay for repairing a broken motorcycle.

427
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,540
Do you have no shame?

428
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,620
Hua.

429
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,020
Let's go.

430
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,940
Aren't you afraid

431
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,980
of me like this?

432
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,380
No.

433
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,140
I even feel a little bit exciting.

434
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,380
It's a pity that I didn't get to see your heroic appearance.

435
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,940
That's really a pity.

436
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,780
You didn't see...

437
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,060
The three of us

438
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,740
faced hundreds of them.

439
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,540
So many of them?

440
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,530
But I saw only six or seven people walking outside.

441
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,340
Were there many others ahead?

442
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,980
Why didn't you call the police?

443
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,570
We have our own way of handling things.

444
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,260
That's right.

445
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,380
Right, we have our own way.

446
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,690
Why are you looking for me?

447
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,300
I plan to write my own novel.

448
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,420
I want you to check it for me.

449
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,340
Sure.

450
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,220
I have many stories in my mind anyway.

451
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,940
Really?

452
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,180
I can tell you

453
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,060
all about this matter tonight.

454
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,100
OK.

455
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,420
I’ll figure it out for you.

456
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,700
That yellow-haired guy,

457
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,940
with bandages wrapped around his head...

458
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,740
So awesome?

459
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,660
You hit my feet.

460
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,460
Any problem?

461
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,850
No.

462
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,780
I told you just

463
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,620
to let you know.

464
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,700
Don't always give him money.

465
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,540
Indulgence from a mother often leads to the child's incompetence.

466
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,850
Do you understand this?

467
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,780
Yes, you know everything.

468
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,540
Then find a job for him.

469
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,020
He can't do anything.

470
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,820
How could I let him do anything?

471
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,380
If you didn't find jobs for him,

472
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,500
how could he be competent?

473
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,620
Everything must follow a certain order.

474
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,260
How dare you say that?

475
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,980
If you taught him well,

476
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,540
would he be like this today?

477
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,980
Li Jianxun, don't you have any shame?

478
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Have you ever cared about your child?

479
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,140
You either went on business trips or socialised all day.

480
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,940
You can count the days

481
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,620
you spent with him on your fingers.

482
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,300
How dare you say that?

483
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,490
♫ Find some time when you're available♫

I'm back.

493
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,820
My son, you're back.

494
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,330
Guess what I brought

495
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,420
for you.

496
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,540
Chicken feet.

497
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,300
Try it.

498
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,660
Why are there no bones?

499
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,100
I removed them.

500
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,540
My son is so nice to me.

501
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
Of course.

502
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,100
Mom,

503
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,140
I've made a career plan recently.

504
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,100
I'm ready to work.

505
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,020
What?

506
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,940
Of course,

507
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,500
I have to work hard

508
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,260
for my mon who's the best in the world.

509
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,500
What does it have to do with me?

510
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,580
Of course it has.

511
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,860
Men are unreliable.

512
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,660
In this world, the only man

513
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,100
a woman can rely on

514
