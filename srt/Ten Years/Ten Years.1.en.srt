00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,100
So I prepared crispy pigeon and roasted pig in Guangdong cuisine.

175
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,420
Mr. Zhang went to a university in Taizhou.

176
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:07,860
So,

177
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,980
I prepared him Taizhou Rice Cake with Yellow Fish.

178
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,820
I don't know where Secretary Lu from.

179
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,860
But he should like Freshly Brewed Morel Mushrooms

180
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,700
and Crispy Honeycomb Beef Brisket.

181
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,740
Very good.

182
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,940
How is it?

183
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,180
She didn't pick up.

184
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,980
It's okay.

185
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,180
I can find her.

186

can you contact Wang Ran for me?

192

I can't reach her now.

193

I don't know where Ranran is.

194

She didn't tell me.

195
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,860
Can you try to contact her for me?

196
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,860
Okay.

197
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,780
I'll contact her now,

198

and tell her to call you back immediately.

199
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,220
Okay.

200
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,060

Call Miss Li when you see this message.

She has something urgent to tell you.

204

205
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,940
By the way, Ke,

206
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,540
is this a big power electrical appliance?

207
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,700
We'll be punished if we get caught.

208

211
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,660
It took an hour

to come here by bus.

213

Half an hour on the highway.

214
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,020
If I reach the highway entrance now...

215
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,900
That happens to be the departure time for the bus.

216
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,700
The time should be just right.

217
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,980
Got it, got it.

218
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,940
Five yuan. Five yuan.

219
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,300
Uncle, I need to discuss with you.

220

Can you get me to the highway entrance now?

This is not okay.

222

Didn't we made a deal earlier?

223

It's not my fault.

I did.

265
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,380
It's all because I'm too handsome.

They will be our backups.

347
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,260
That's good.

348
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,010
This friendly match

349
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,500
is a commemorative event celebrating the 10th anniversary

350
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,660
of the exchange between the two schools.

351
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,060
The form of the event should be innovative and harmonious.

352
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,420
Winning is not important.

353
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,540
Friendship comes first.

354
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,180
Right?

355
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,260
But the four of our speakers should be good-looking,

356
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,540
and elegant.

357
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,540
They must have a good image,

358
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,100
and can show the charisma of our school.

359
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,620
As long as Lin Yicheng and Wang Ran can make it,

360
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,540
I'll let them take the stage.

361
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,180
Do you have any confidence now?

362
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,220
No problem.

363
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,300
See, we still have 20 minutes.

364
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,580
I'm confident.

365
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,020
I'll call them again.

366
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,220
Wang Ran,

367
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,060
why are you still here?

368
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,740
Miss Li has already...

369
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,940
What's wrong with Miss Li?

370
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,660
This young man, he...

371
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,580
Miss Li is dying.

372
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,060
She was fine this afternoon.

373
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,650
Stop talking.

374
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,700
She's not only a teacher,

375
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,740
but also your aunt.

376
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,500
Bing, directors,

377
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,100
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,740
Something urgent came up at home.

379
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,660
I have to go.

380
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,420
Sorry.

381
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,210
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,140
It's okay.

383
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,020
She's young.

384
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,100
And has something to do at home.

385
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,180
Let's continue.

386
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,020
Are you ready?

387
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,660
Yes.

388
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,460
Miss Li, where are they?

389
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,740
Why haven't they arrived yet?

390
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,580
It's okay.

391
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,380
I am confident.

392
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
I'm confident.

393
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,180
Confident?

394
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
It's almost eight o'clock.

395
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,860
How can you still be confident?

396
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Alright, I won't wait.

397
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,980
Let's start now.

403
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,140
good evening.

The affirmative side's topic for today is...

[The affirmative]

407
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,740
For youth, reality comes before ideals.

[The negative]

410

The negative side's topic is...

411
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,580
For youth, ideals comes before reality.

412
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,220
[First speaker]

413
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,780
First, let's welcome the first speaker of the affirmative.

414
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,820
Host, judges and classmates,

415
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,780
good evening.

416
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,900
Our topic is

417
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,940
for youth, reality comes before ideals.

418
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,300
First, we must define

419
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,580
what youth is.

420
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,060
I used to think 18 is youth.

421
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,220
But in reality, the modern society,

422
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,140
youth is before 30,

423
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,300
or even before 40.

424
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,940
That means, youth is not confined solely to the campus,

425
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,580
it also exists within society.

426
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,140
Of course we can talk about ideals in campus.

427
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,460
But in society,

428
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,540
reality is more important than ideals.

429
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,180
Thank you.

430
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,420
Next, let's welcome the first speaker of the negative.

431
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,860
Host, judges,

432
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,940
classmates, good evening.

433
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
Our topic is

434
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
for youth, ideals are more important than reality.

435
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,340
First, we think

436
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,700
the affirmative has confused the concept

437
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,660
of psychological youth with physical youth.

438
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,420
A 40-year-old man,

439
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,420
we can say that he is a psychologically young man.

440
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,220
But he no longer has youth.

441
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,260
What is youth?

442
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,780
Youth is campus.

443
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,260
So we, who are still in campus,

444
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,860
should let our ideals go first.

445
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,020
OK.

446
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,170
Now let's welcome the second speaker of the affirmative.

447
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,430
The affirmative.

448
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,920
We think deals comes before reality

449
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,100
is because...

450
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,700
So we think

451
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,980
youth can't be defined.

452
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,940
They came.

453
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,620
Just like a book,

454
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,460
it is the front and back cover that completes it.

455
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,380
The true essence of ideals

456
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,100
lies in laughter, hard work,

457
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
and happiness.

458
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,900
But in our lives,

459
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,020
we are confronted with more confusion, frustration,

460
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,180
and tears.

461
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,060
So I think this is also youth.

462
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,300
As our second debater said,

463
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,900
life is not perfect,

464
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,220
but it's complete.

465
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,900
So complete is perfect.

466
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,380
For youth,

467
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,140
ideals are like buildings,

468
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,660
reality is like a foundation.

469
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,180
But no matter how imperfect the foundation is,

470
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,300
it's still a foundation.

471
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,580
Good!

472
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,300
Host,

473
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,220
Lin Yicheng and I

474
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,900
are the second and third speaker of the affirmative side.

475
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,810
I request to substitute the reserve team members.

476
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,820
I agree.

477
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,740
No.

478
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,940
You were ten minutes late.

479
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,980
This is against the rules.

480
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,420
I'd like to show teachers a video.

481
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,900
Daughter!

482
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,060
Are you alright?

483
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,460
Wake up!

484
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,140
Hello, 120.

485
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,900
I hit someone.

486
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,020
Where?

487
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,860
Are you okay?

488
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,100
I don't know. Just come here.

489
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,620
Come here!

490
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,900
Save my daughter first.

491
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,820
Little girl.

492
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,620
Little girl.

493
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,100
Hurry up!

494
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,460
Daughter!

495
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,300
Little girl!

496
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,940
Daughter!

497
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
They were acting bravely in the face of danger.

498
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,580
They were helping others.

499
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,660
No wonder.

500
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,020
Otherwise, it wouldn't take so long.

501
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,180
Look.

502
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,340
This is Lin Yicheng from our school.

503
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,530
Here.

504
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,220
Not bad, right?

505
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,820
Slowly.

506
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,620
In this case,

507
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,500
substituting is acceptable.

508
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,700
Okay.

509
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,860
Our guests agree that

510
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,300
these two students can substitute them.

511
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,460
Because we have always hoped

512
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,460
for some innovation

513
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,940
in this year's tenth anniversary friendly match

514
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
between our two schools.

515
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,940
What you did

516
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
is good.

517
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,380
The opposing debater has said that

518
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,610
laughter and tears are both youth.

519
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,900
That's true.

520
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,820
But we should understand

521
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,770
tears are the way to laughter.

522
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,700
Confusion is the way to work hard.

523
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,660
So, reality is the way of ideals.

524
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,940
We must put ideals before reality.

525
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,020
The opposing debater mentioned ways,

526
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,380
which also proves our point of view.

527
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,060
Ways are like foundations.

528
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,060
The third speaker has just said

529
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
we can't build a building without the foundation.

530
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,580
It's like without the sail of reality,

531
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,700
the boat of ideals cannot set sail.

532
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,140
The opposing debater compares reality to sail.

533
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,620
This actually proves our point of view.

534
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,220
The sail is the reality.

535
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,460
The ocean is the direction.

536
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,220
If there is no direction,

537
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,900
why do we build a boat?

538
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,540
We need a boat

539
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,980
before we can think of setting sail.

540
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,460
Learning how to build a boat is the first step

541
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,580
towards embarking on a long journey.

542
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,500
We not only need to learn how to build a boat,

543
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,020
but also need to learn how to use a compass,

544
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,420
how to navigate through storms,

545
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,460
as these are all realities.

546
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,780
Without these practical skills,

547
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,700
how can we ride the wind and cleave the waves,

548
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,900
and set sail to cross the sea?

549
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,980
The debate today was a success.

550
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,100
Yes.

551
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,460
We won the bonus.

552
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,100
So I brought my friends here to have a meal.

553
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,940
Introduce your friends to me.

554
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,620
This is Chen Tao,

555
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,780
my best friend from middle school to high school.

556
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,940
He's not from our school.

557
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,460
But he graduated one year earlier than us.

558
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
It's the first time we meet.

559
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,500
Bottoms up.

560
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,300
It's okay, it's okay.

561
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,100
Just like that?

562
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,860
Is that okay?

563
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,540
It's okay.

564
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
You really can drink.

565
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,500
Li Wenkai.

566
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,060
Xuan,

567
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,780
you must be familiar with him.

568
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,220
I know Kai.

569
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
He always supports my business.

570
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,620
He comes here many times a month,

571
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,220
with different girls every time.

572
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,340
Xuan, I have a new friend here.

573
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,340
This is Wang Ran,

574
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,780
my classmate from the Media Department,

575
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,060
is also the partner of today's debate.

576
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,420
The best debater.

577
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,380
Hello, Xuan.

578
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,780
You are Wang Ran?

579
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,010
What a beautiful girl.

580
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,380
Thank you, Xuan.

581
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,100
I've heard of you, Wang Ran.

582
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,060
You’re the beauty of the Media Department.

583
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,940
Don’t, Mr. Li.

584
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,060
I have also heard about you.

585
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,980
You're always chasing after your junior girls.

586
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,500
As the saying goes,

587
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,100
when you first meet Wenkai in Xicheng University,

588
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,540
he will ruin your life.

589
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,860
It's a false reputation.

590
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,620
Let me introduce her to you.

591
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,900
Liu Ke, my roommate and best friend.

592
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
A little foodie.

593
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,100
Hello, everyone,

594
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I'm Liu Ke.

595
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,740
Cheng is my little brother.

596
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,460
Your friends are also my friends.

597
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,860
Here, a toast to everyone.

598
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,100
Cheers!

599
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,380
Cheers!

600
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,060
Come often after graduation.

601
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,330
Eat up.

602
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,020
It's fate that

603
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,860
has brought us together here.

604
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,460
I have a suggestion.

605
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,460
Let's gather here every year,

606
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,460
OK?

607
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,060
Sure.

608
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,060
Okay.

609
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,180
That being the case,

610
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,100
I hereby announce

611
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,660
that our Shikeya team

612
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,090
is officially formed today!

613
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,660
Let's take a photo.

614
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,900
Let me take one for you five.

615
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,300
Here.

616
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,620
Okay.

617
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,500
Okay.

618
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,420
Look at me.

619
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,780
Three, two, one.

620
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,620
Cheese!
