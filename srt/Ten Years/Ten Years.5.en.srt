4
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,860
Bing, the latest progress.

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,660
Plan B is going smoothly.

6
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,260
Miss Wang.

7
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,660
Your latte.

8
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,539
Thank you.

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,420
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

10
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,580
It's not that.

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,380
You know it. The competition for graduate school is fierce.

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,979
And my work isn't going well.

13
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,979
I just want to be more stable.

14
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,020
At least I can get a raise in my salary.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,860
Actually, our company's major product

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,380
is the frequency controller for water supply equipment.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,300
Our recent profits and performance

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,340
haven't been very good.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,020
Your company sells frequency controllers?

20
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,700
Perfect.

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,740
One of our businesses

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,180
is also to sell large water purification equipment.

23
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,180
We can cooperate.

24
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,220
Really?

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,539
Yes.

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,700
That's great.

27
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,060
But

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,460
our company is also involved in the real estate business.

29
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,260
So, we may not have enough money.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,370
Is the real estate company still short of money?

31
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,620
Of course, many projects are stuck.

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,020
It's okay.

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,700
We can discuss a draft first.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,500
We can discuss the details

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,660
if we decide to cooperate on some projects.

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,370
Okay.

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,500
Brother,

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,740
I'm going to Beijing in a few days.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,780
So I want to give my boss some advice.

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,130
He's also a real estate investor

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,500
and will also invest in some industries.

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,980
Now he has a problem.

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,740
Should he use his limited funds

44
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,260
to bid for land

45
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,740
or continue to invest in industries?

46
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,820
Do you have any good advice for me?

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,820
Well,

48
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,140
you've come to the right person.

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,820
I'm in this industry.

50
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,500
Then give me some,

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,060
OK?

52
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,660
Okay.

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,340
Then I'll use our company as an example

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,260
to tell you how to invest.

55
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,579
First of all, to invest,

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,500
you need to grab the chance.

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,900
Miss Wang.

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,460
Why don't we find

59
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,620
somewhere quiet and drink more?

60
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,340
I don't think I can make it today.

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,140
My boyfriend is here to pick me up.

62
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,860
How about we meet another day?

63
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,940
I'll be waiting.

64
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,579
I gotta go. Bye.

65
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,820
Bye.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,980
That's it.

67
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,980
Thank you.

68
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,620
Bye.

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,500
Bye.

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,460
This woman.

71
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,940
And you accused me of hiding something.

72
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,899
Why is it so quiet today?

73
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,820
Maybe it's because someone has booked the whole place.

74
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,780
The next song

75
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,500
is my favorite.

76
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,460
I think that girl

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,860
would like this song too.

78
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:57,030
♫ Hearing the sound of winter's footsteps fading away ♫

79
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,300
♫ I woke up in a certain month of a certain year ♫

80
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,450
♫ I think, I wait, and I look forward to it ♫

81
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,710
♫ But the future can't be arranged because of this ♫

82
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,320
♫Cloudy day, in the evening, outside the car window♫

83
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,200
♫ Someone is waiting for you in the future ♫

84
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,540
♫ Look to the left, to the right, and forward ♫

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,370
♫ How many turns does love take to come? ♫

86
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:56,850
♫ Who will I meet, and what will we say? ♫

87
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,510
♫ When will the man I'm waiting for come? ♫

88
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,330
♫  I hear the wind from the subway and the crowd ♫

89
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,150
♫ I queued up, holding the number plate for love ♫

90
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,020
I really want to be your friend.

91
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,140
Can I?

92
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,580
Order anything you want. All on me.

93
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,540
How about the whole package?

94
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,580
Is this a trap?

95
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Don't get me wrong.

96
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,900
Actually,

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,460
I just want to apologize to your best friend, Wu Zhiyun.

98
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,659
This is a little gift I bought

99
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,780
for you. That's all.

100
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,900
Since you're so sincere,

101
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,460
I'll help you.

102
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,900
I didn't do it for this purse.

103
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,660
I just want meat.

104
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,060
Got it.

105
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,300
Waiter, the whole set.

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,140
Okay.

107
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,180
Here, Miss Wang, please.

108
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Why did you invite me to dinner today?

109
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,060
I want to introduce you to two friends.

110
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,060
Have a seat.

111
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,460
They'll be here soon.

112
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,460
I don't think I need to introduce this one.

113
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,460
Then the second one.

114
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,659
I think you should be able to guess who he is.

115
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,060
You're all here.

116
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,100
Let me introduce.

117
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,940
This is

118
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,060
the chairman of our Xiaoshou Group,

119
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,890
Qin Xiaoshou.

120
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,820
This lady here

121
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,220
knows me and our Secretary Hu.

122
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,340
She is Wang Ran.

123
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,180
She is the chairman's assistant to our competitor,

124
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,940
Xintai Real Estate.

125
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,700
Welcome.

126
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,380
Hello, Mr. Qin.

127
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,700
It's a pleasure to finally meet you!

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,740
Miss Wang is so calm.

129
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,380
You really have the style of a general.

130
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,140
Mr. Qin, stop making fun of me.

131
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,420
I'm just

132
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,020
a girl with nothing special.

133
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,020
I only have some street smarts

134
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,020
to earn credits from Director Yan.

135
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,180
I've learned the meaning of

136
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,500
a blessing in disguise.

137
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,260
It's my honor

138
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,180
to know Mr. Qin, Secretary Hu, and Consultant Shi again.

139
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,380
I'm very happy.

140
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,900
Miss Wang has a ready tongue.

141
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,020
You're so eloquent.

142
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,220
Mr. Qin, I have to say.

143
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,180
I really admire the buildings you built in Shapingba District.

144
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
It's surrounded by mountains and rivers.

145
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,660
And the mountain pass is round.

146
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,380
In Fung Shui, it's called Mount Jinxing.

147
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,540
Digging out a lake means gathering water at the gate.

148
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,940
The most amazing thing

149
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,020
is the road that runs through the compound

150
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,420
like a jade belt.

151
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,020
In Fung Shui, it's called a jade belt around the waist.

152
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,820
Listen.

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,300
You always complain that the road has too many bends and curves

154
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,580
and looks weird.

155
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,980
Do you understand now?

156
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,020
Miss Wang, I'm impressed.

157
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,220
I admire you.

158
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
Miss Wang,

159
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,980
I also put a lot of thought

160
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,020
into these buildings.

161
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,060
In terms of feng shui,

162
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,300
it's called " The mountain attracts Loong to rest here with its head rising;

163
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,460
its water beards around the place;

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,980
the front is broad for blessing;

165
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,380
the river outlets hoard wealth.

166
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Yao Yanluan, from the Qing Dynasty...

167

Compilations of Where to Build a House.

168
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,900
Here, Miss Wang.

169
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,700
Cheers.

170
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,500
Mr. Qin.

171
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,620
Miss Wang,

341
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,820
Thank you, Mr. Li.

342
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,820
Thank you.

343
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,140
Fourth floor, first room on your left.

344
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,980
Got it.

345
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,060
Please.

346
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,980
I heard Miss Wang is talented.

347
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,900
Can you help me see my paintings and calligraphy here?

348
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,500
This spring morning in bed I'm lying; Not to awake till birds are crying.

349
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,140
After one night of wind and showers; How many are the fallen flowers?

350
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,900
Brother Qin also likes the poem "Spring Morning".

351
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,220
Every elementary school student can recite this poem.

352
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,380
Miss Wang, you don't find the poem shallow?

353
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,540
It doesn't mean shallow.

354
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,020
The first verse is about awakening consciousness.

355
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,140
The second awakening hearing.

356
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,180
The third awakening memory.

357
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,260
And the last verse means pity.

358
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,940
I didn't expect you to understand it so thoroughly.

359
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,900
I really admire you.

360
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,940
Here.

361
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,260
What do you think of Tang poetry?

362
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,180
People always say Tang poetry is bold and unconstrained.

363
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,780
But I think

364
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,820
Tang poetry

365
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,020
can evoke the most compassionate feelings.

366
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,780
Personally, my favorite poem is

367
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,260
"On the Tower at Youzhou" by Zhen Zi'ang.

368
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,500
Miss Wang likes this poem too.

369
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,660
Please go to the study.

370
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,380
Okay.

371
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,700
Where are the great men of the past; And where are those of future years?

372
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,020
The sky and earth forever last; Here and now I alone shed tears.

373
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,500
I wrote it.

374
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,060
Compassion for the ancient and modern worlds, which makes the viewer feel moved.

375
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,140
Put "Spring Morning" in the hall

376
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,940
and this one in the study.

377
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,540
It's very exquisite.

378
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,740
I really admire you.

379
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,700
I didn't expect

380
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,020
that Miss Wang would know the truth about

381
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,980
"from shallow to deeper."

382
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Cheers!

383
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,780
Lin, you're still here?

384
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,060
Boss,

385
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,700
I've revised the press release

386
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,340
and sent it to your phone.

387
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,020
Okay.

388
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,060
You work overtime on your first day.

389
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,820
Thank you.

390
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
It's my duty.

391
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,220
Go back as soon as you finish your work.

392
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,220
Boss.

393
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,580
Thank you.

394
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,300
It's all fate.

395
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,340
What's wrong?

396
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,860
Don't come over.

397
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,980
What happened?

398
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,180
What's wrong?

399
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,020
I'm traumatized.

400
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,780
What trauma?

401
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,700
I was hurt before.

402
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,180
When I joined the company,

403
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,060
the people I met were all particularly vulgar.

404
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,980
The truth is,

405
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,860
I'm here with a mission this time.

406
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,900
Bing said if I can't get the cooperation this time,

407
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,540
she'll dismiss me.

408
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,220
As for the cooperation,

409
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,420
with you,

410
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,420
we can make it.

411
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,100
The cooperation is finally settled.

412
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,780
But the way used is the one I hate the most.

413
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,540
Although Bing forced me,

414
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,900
I compromised.

415
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,140
The price is that I made a mistake that I shouldn't have made.

416
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,460
It makes me regretful

417
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,220
and scared.

418
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,260
Lin Yicheng.

419

♫ I wish I could have that day again ♫

What is it?

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,260
I nailed

434
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,020
the project I told you about before.

435
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,580
Really?

436
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,620
I have good news for you.

437
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,500
I can stay.

439

I'm a regular employee now and have joined the entertainment department.

440
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,820
To be an entertainment reporter?

441
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
It's hard.

442
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,400
♫ There's no need to say ♫

443
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
All things are hard.

444

♫ I hope we can meet again ♫

445

Next week, the end of the world.

446
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,180
See you at the Shikeya.

447
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,820
See you at the end of the world.

448
