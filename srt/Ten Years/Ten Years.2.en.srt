How about I give you an IOU?

Uncle, here's the thing...

154
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,540
I started this,

155
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,500

You are Lin, right?

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,540
Since you are about to graduate,

158
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,940
I'll treat you as an adult

159

and say a few words.

160
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,060
The reason you want to write an IOU...

161
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,780
Is it because you want to be responsible for yourself,

162
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,180
or to regain some dignity?

163
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,700
If you smooth the things out by yourself,

164
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,539
you can maintain your dignity.

165

Since you asked me to do it,

166
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,460

Thank you.

178

I'm worried.

179
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,740
Worried about what?

180
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,700
I'm worried that it's not safe for you to be alone.

192
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,500
then slapped myself?

You can't achieve anything.

196

Chongqing is a mountain city, right?

We need cars to travel.

223
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,180
Because it's a mountain city,

224
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,500
the roads are narrow.

225
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,580
You have to twist and turn, and drive up and down the hills.

226
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
It's not that convenient to drive.

227

What you need is a motorcycle.

228
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,220
But buying a new one...

229
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,890
First, it's not practical and too expensive.

230
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,020
Second, it has no taste.

231
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,460
Unlike you, you have an old Zong Shen.

232

Isn't it cool?

236
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,620
It does look cool.

All financial indexes have increased steadily.

241
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,260
For example, the KPI,

You're not a finance major anyway.

245
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,100
It's useless to tell you this.

246
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,580
Anyway,

247
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,380

248
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,300

Every time when I met her, I couldn't help turning around.

251
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,420
But I know

252
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,620
she won't notice me.

253
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,820
We're in the same major but different classes.

254

For four years in the university,

255
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,780
I haven't had a chance to talk to her.

256
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,340
So I'm look forward to every public class.

257
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,180
At least I have a chance to see her.

258
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,700
I didn't expect that upon graduation,

259
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,140
we became teammates of the debate team.

260
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,220
I can stand beside her and

261
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,780
talk to her as much as I want.

262
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,860
When I think back,

263
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,540
it was a very happy time.

264
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,260
Sometimes I will think that

[The Alchemy of Finance, George Soros.]

351
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,099
This is my favorite book.

352
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,020
So I bought a new one

353
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,180
as a collection. A collection.

354
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,820
If there's nothing else,

355
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,180
I'll leave now.

356
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,940
Tell me if you need anything.

357
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,300
Thank you.

358
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,460
Thank you.

359
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,500
You're back.

360
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,580
Is everything settled?

361
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,740
Yes.

362
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,340
Will you blame me for calling the police?

363
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,820
Sister, what are you talking about?

364
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,580
If you hadn't called the police in time,

365
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,780
I don't know what kind of trouble we would cause.

366
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,700
Why were you acting so impulsive?

367
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,300
It's not like you.

368
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Maybe...

369
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,940
Maybe I am impulsive.

370
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,540
Sister, I want to sit here alone for a bit.

371
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,260
I'll help you clean up later.

372
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,700
Okay.

[Shikeya Hot Pot]

374
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,900
Let's go downstairs for noodles.

375
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,780
Don't wake them up.

376
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,180
Eat.

377
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,180
I'll eat then.

378
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,620
Eat.

379
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,040
-It's so good.
-Hush.

380
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,900
Be quiet.

381
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,740
It's so delicious.

382
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,580
Eat slowly.

383
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,100
By the way, Tao,

384
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,140
you know Ranran and the others have gone back, right?

385
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,780
Did Lin Yicheng tell you?

386
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,140
Yes.

387
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,900
I told you there's nothing serious.

388
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Don't worry.

389
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,660
I took care of it.

390
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,220
You did?

391
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,140
What do you think?

392
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,460
I just sent a message

393
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,340
and it was solved.

394
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,860
The most important thing in this world

395
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
is about connections.

396
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,100
Who is it?

397
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,160
Hush.

398
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,030
I can't tell you.

399
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
Eat.

400
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,380
Eat.

401
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,900
Sister.

402
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,700
No matter what happens,

403
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,330
you have to eat well.

404
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,620
Thank you.

405
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,340
Take it. It's bonus.

406
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,020
Sister,

407
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,780
I can't take the money.

408
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,300
I've caused you so much trouble.

409
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,540
Stop talking. Take it.

410
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,140
You're going to graduate

411
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,820
and you're going to work.

412
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,220
You deserve it.

413
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,180
No matter how busy you are,

414
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,100
remember,

415
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,620
this is always your home.

416
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,700
Come home often.

417
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
It's delicious.
