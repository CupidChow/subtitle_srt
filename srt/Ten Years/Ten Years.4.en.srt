Yes.

The client said he had an important meeting.

10

So I've been waiting for him.

Is there a big difference?

The salary for interns is 1000 yuan.

while the salary for regular employees is 6000 yuan.

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,380
I was afraid you're still mad at me.

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,620
Why would I be mad at you?

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,660
Because of the fight.

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,140
You almost couldn't graduate because of that.

No, of course not.

42

I'm sorry.

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,620
I should be the one apologizing.

I caused trouble for everyone

48

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,180
Lin, I...

177
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,660
Let me tell you.

178
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,980
If I don't keep them,

179
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
I have to leave.

180
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,900
Understand?

181
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,740
I'm also an employee.

182
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,140
I also need to go and find sponsorships for the Journalist Festival now.

183
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,020
3 million.

184
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,700
If you can get it, you can stay.

185
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,740
We are adults.

186
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,020
Don't follow me. It's dangerous.

Mr. Zhu,

196
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,020
Are you really not considering it anymore?

197
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,660
We didn't get

198
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
the budget for this sponsorship.

199
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,260
Sorry to bother you.

200
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,100
How about this?

201
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,260
I'll recommend two friends to you.

202
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,340

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,820
Card or cash?

213
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,490
[Receipt: 2632]

214
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,940
Hold on.

215
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,900
Okay.

216
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,940
Hello, Li.

217
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,620
It's me, yes.

218
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,140
I need some cash.

219
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,260
Send it to me now.

220
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,580
I'll send you the address later.

221
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,420
Hurry up.

222
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,220
I'm in a hurry.

223
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,220
Okay.

224
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,980
Right away.

225
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,460
Lin,

226
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,220
you can tell Li

227
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,620
that you are looking for sponsorships.

228
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,940
Li can help you.

229
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,380
Damn you!

230
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Li, actually,

231
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,420
I think it's better to be purely business.

232
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,980
If they're willing to sponsor me

233
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,420
just for my sake,

234
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,820
I don't think it'll be good for everyone in the future.

235
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,770
You're right.

236
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,260
My dad has a friend who raises cows

237
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
is coming to Chongqing this time.

238
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,940
He happens to be interested in sponsoring.

239
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,340
How about I contact him for you?

240
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,780
Okay, thanks.

241
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,820
Why are you laughing?

242
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,780
Professional planning consultation,

243
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,140
aren't you professional in this?

244
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,490
Let me tell you,

245
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,020
I've turned over a new leaf.

246
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,940
What did you say? Did I hear it right?

247
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,300
You don't trust me?

248
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,180
When did I ever trust you?

249
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,940
Stop it.

250
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,780
I'm really here for a professional planning.

251
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,140
How is she?

252
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,380
Is there a sudden feeling of crush?

253
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,020
Love at first sight.

254
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,500
At least the feeling at this moment is real.

255
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,260
A new female colleague in the company.

256
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,100
A good girl.

257
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,420
But she's quite arrogant.

258
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,700
It's hard to deal with her.

259
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,420
Who said I want to deal with her?

260
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,380
I just think she is very beautiful now.

261
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,740
What did you say you wanted to turn?

262
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,100
Turn over a new leaf.

263
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,100
You know what?

264
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,940
You can go against me,

265
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,980
but you have to go against the consultation fee.

266
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,660
Then don't blame me.

267
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,180
For the sake of money,

268
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,420
I'll help you.

269
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,860
Let's drink after work.

270
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,100
A prodigal's change is worth more than gold.

271
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,580
I can't go to such a place anymore.

285
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,020
I called him to come here.

286
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,900
He said he had something important to do.

287
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,740
What important thing?

288
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,580
He must be hitting on girls.

289
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,940
Mr. Jia,

290
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,060
I apologize on behalf of Wenkai.

291
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,260

292
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
Good.

293
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
Not bad, young man.

294
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Not bad.

You're honest.

You and Kai

300
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,220
should visit my grassland in the future.

301
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,300
OK.

Jia, sorry,

315
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
I'm late.

316
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,700
You are not late.

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,740
Come, sit inside.

319
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,620
I've been waiting for you.

320
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,900
Come on.

321
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,660
Have a sit.

322
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,020
I should be the host here.

323
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Thank you.

324
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,460
Have a seat.

325
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,980
It's the same.

326
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,660
Let me introduce.

327
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,860
Li Yihang.

328
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,460
He helped me a lot

329
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,260
when I was starting a business in Chongqing.

330
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,660
He's really something now.

331
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,700
You know what?

332
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,100
He's the leader of the Entertainment Department of the TV station.

333
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,410
Let me introduce them.

334
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,260
These are my colleagues.

335
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
He is an employee of your TV station.

336
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,940
3 million.

337
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,620
If you can get it, you can stay.

338
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,660
We are adults.

339
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,940
Don't follow me. It's dangerous.

340
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,460
Hello, Mr. Li.

341
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm Lin from the News Department.

342
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,500
Hello.

343
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,060
Come on.

344
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,540
Let me pour it for you.

345
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,619
I have given you two plans.

346
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,900
Make your choice.

347
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,180
Bing.

348
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,940
It's really hard for me to achieve the first plan.

349
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,180
Qin Xiaoshou, Director of Xiaoshou Group,

350
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,540
likes studying feng shui usually.

351
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,860
He pretends to be sophisticated and calls himself a master.

352
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,500
There are more parents consulting this month.

353
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,020
The enrollment number for this year will definitely double.

354
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,140
For families with poor conditions,

355
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,980
tuition fees will be appropriately reduced.

356
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,220
Confucius said, "Education knows no boundaries."

357
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,300
I invested in this academy of Chinese culture

358
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,580
not for money.

359
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,380
Mr. Qin, look.

360
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,220
This painting

361
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,780
was drawn by a student

362
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,020
of our art class.

363
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,940
If you like it,

364
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,860
why don't you write some lines on it?

365
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,060
Well done.

366
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,100
It reminds me of two lines of Li Bai.

367
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,060
The sound of monkeys on both shores never ceases,

368
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,420
while a line of white egrets soars into the blue sky.

369
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,580
Do you think these two lines are suitable?

370
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,620
Yes, I do.

371
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,500
These two lines

372
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,860
have perfectly captured the artistic conception

373
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,540
of this painting.

374
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,020
What do you think?

375
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,180
I don't know much about Li Bai's poems.

376
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,820
The first characteristic of Qin Xiaoshou

377
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,700
is that he appears serious on the surface,

378
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,380
but in reality, he hides a sharp knife beneath his smile.

379
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,700
Pear blossoms bloom

380
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,860
with rain in spring.

381
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,620
Mr. Qin.

382
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,220
Mr. Qin.

383
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,500
Which one of our 2 new intern teachers

384
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,980
can stay?

385
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,620
Miss. Zheng.

386
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,220
Why her?

387
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,580
The sound of monkeys on both shores never ceases,

388
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,130
while the light boat has already passed through countless mountains.

389
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,180
I purposely said

390
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,980
while a line of white egrets soars into the blue sky.

391
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,860
Miss. Zheng

392
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,620
was more honest.

393
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,060
But Miss. Lyu...

394
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,860
She knew I was wrong,

395
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,700
but she was still flattering me.

396
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,140
This is her fault.

397
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,780
I'll fire Lyu Yan then.

398
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,580
No.

399
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,220
The second characteristic of this person is cunning.

400
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,210
He's good at dealing with girls.

401
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,220
Good.

402
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,180
You've researched deeply.

403
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,380
It's similar to my investigation.

404
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,380
Qin Xiaoshou

405
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
is cunning.

406
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
What about Plan B?

407
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,540
Hu Yuxuan, Qin Xiaoshou's assistant,

408
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,740
and investment consultant Shi Hao.

409
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,500
As long as we make good use of these two people,

410
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
we can also achieve our goal.

411
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,860
Hu Yuxuan

412
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,100
is 31 years old.

413
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,540
He graduated from a master of science.

414
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,220
A straight guy with high education and good performance.

415
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,180
He follows a home-work routine every day.

416
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,900
Likes reading.

417
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,420
He doesn't even have time to date.

418
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,740
It's easier to extract information from him.

419
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,060
Shi Hao, 41 years old.

420
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,140
An investment consultant.

421
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,020
He is a cunning fox.

422
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,860
He's good at risk management.

423
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,940
It's almost impossible

424
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,020
to deal with him when he's working.

425
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,740
But he likes to drink after work.

426
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,180
That's when he's relaxed.

427
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,580
There are always accidents in the plan.

428
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,340
What if Plan B fails?

429
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,420
So Plan A must succeed.

430
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,340
Bing,

431
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,540
we can talk business with him.

432
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,820
These methods are not good.

433
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,940
Do I need you to teach me?

434
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,420
You don't have to do it.

435
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,180
But that means

436
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,170
you are not qualified for this job.

437
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,860
You can leave now.

438
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,220
I'm not talking about the company,

439
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,740
but this industry.

440
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,020
The starting price of this land is 2 billion.

441
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,700
The company can offer at most 2.5 billion.

442
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,380
On this basis,

443
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,100
we'll see how much you can save.

444
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,180
Out of the saved amount,

445
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,180
I will give you a 5% reward.

446
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,260
Wish you success.

447
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Good!

448
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,620
-You're a good drinker. -Nice.

449
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,860
Not bad.

450
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
Not bad.

451
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Not bad.

452
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Good.

453
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,900
Awesome.

454
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,300
Come on. Again.

455
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,220
Put it down, young man.

456
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,980
Put it down.

457
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,060
Slow down.

458
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,980
Jia,

459
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,140
don't force young people to drink like this.

460
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,500
No, no, no.

461
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,860
He didn't force me.

462
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,980
I'm fine.

463
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,020
Drink!

464
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,140
I'm very happy

465
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,820
to meet Mr. Jia today.

466
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,700
Mr. Xiao, a toast to you.

467
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,540
Dude, an honest man.

468
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Mr. Tian.

469
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,940
Jia,

470
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,260
this young man is an employee of the TV station.

471
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,660
That means he's also my man, right?

472
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,380
Yes.

473
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,060
How about this?

474
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,740
I'll drink with him.

475
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,100
My wine is also on him.

476
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,860
What do you think?

477
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,980
If you say that,

478
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
just drink.

479
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,580
Whatever you say.

480
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
I'll raise a glass to you first.

481
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,060
Come on.

482
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
Mr. Jia, a toast.

483
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,580
Bottoms up.

484
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,420
Are you alright?

485
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,580
Mr. Li,

486
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,820
you drank half of it for me.

487
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,740
I...

488
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,980
Are you really okay pushing yourself so hard?

489
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Have you ever thought

490
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,140
that even if you work so hard,

491
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,860
it's still useless.

492
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,660
Now,

493
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,980
I still have a chance to push myself.

494
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,180
I'm afraid I won't even have a chance to push.

495
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,140
Where do you live?

496
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,980
I'll take you home.

497
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,580
Thank you, Mr. Li.

498
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,660
I'm okay.

499
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,340
I can take the bus back.

500
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,980
OK. Be careful.

501
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,580
Yun, here.

502
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,300
Li Wenkai,

503
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,060
how many days have you been following me?

504
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,180
Isn't my attitude clear enough?

505
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,900
I'm not interested in collaborating,

506
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,060
nor in making friends,

507
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,180
nor in being regular friends.

508
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,660
Don't think that being rich

509
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,820
can win over every girl.

510
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,980
Not everyone

511
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
like a peacock like you.

512
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,460
Yun,

513
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,660
I...

514
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,540
just want to make friends with you,

515
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,580
and have dinner with you.

516
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,180
and watch a movie with you.

517
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,540
Not interested.

518
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,700
Can the peacock treat you to a movie?

519
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,620
Sure.

520
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,580
Is the settings of the characters in your novel

521
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,420
a bit cliche?

522
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,140
This name Owe Me A Tear...

523
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,100
Isn't it a bit pretentious?

524
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,860
What should I do?

525
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
I think...

526
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,620
Try this.

527
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,540
They should be enemies from the beginning.

528
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,780
The female lead is Xiaolongnyu from time travel.

529
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,410
The male lead is Spider-Man.

530
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,420
Yeah, the title should be Xiaolongnyu versus Spider-Man.

531
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,420
What do you think?

532
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,060
Xiaolongnyu versus Spider-Man.

533
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,180
Your imagination

534
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,380
is a bit too wild, isn't it?

535
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,100
You don't understand.

536
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,300
Xiaolongnyu versus Spider-Man.

537
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,220
This name

538
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,620
makes people want to watch it.

539
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,100
Are you Li Wenkai?

540
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm Wu Zhiyun's best friend.

541
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,540
She said she was busy,

542
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,420
so she asked me to watch a movie with you.

543
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,380
Are these flowers for Zhiyun?

544
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,300
Do you want it?

545
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,580
No, I want popcorn.

546
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,860
Let's go.

547
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,460
Let's go.

548
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,980
Come pick me up at 10:30 p.m.

549
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,420
Waiter, give me a glass of wine, please.

550
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Beauty, this is on me.

551
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,460
Lin Yicheng,

552
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,740
let's take a walk.

553
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,780
Don't you think

554
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,780
me wearing like this is very weird?

555
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,460
You don't look weird in anything.

556
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,540
How do you know

557
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,740
I went to the bar for the project,

558
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,940
not for fun?

559
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,940
Because I trust you.

560
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,290
What's the reason?

561
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,180
What reason do I need?

562
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,500
I just trust you.

563
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,380
You are so sure about it.

564
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,460
How's the thing

565
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,900
of you becoming a regular employee going?

566
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,780
We need 3 million in sponsorship.

567
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,020
And we're just a little short.

568
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,060
How much short?

569
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,300
2.9 million.

570
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,540
Laughing is better than crying.

571
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,380
I think as long as we persist,

572
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,580
things will go better.
