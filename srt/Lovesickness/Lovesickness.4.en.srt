00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,830
[Episode 4]

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,280
Do I really look much like

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,040
the Empress Dowager's sister?

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,230
Is that why you always mistake me for...

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,640
Mo An'an,

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,270
you suddenly disappeared and then reappeared,

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,870
and now you're playing dumb.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,340
What exactly are you up to?

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,720
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,630
What does "disappeared and then reappeared" mean?

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,280
Stop!

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,390
Xiao Chu!

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,550
You hotheaded man, a typical straight guy!

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,550
I wish you have no seasoning for instant noodles

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,100
and no tissue in the toilet!

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,400
Candied haws! Fresh candied haws!

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,900
Candied haws! Fresh candied haws!

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,100
It's fine that he left. I don't want to go back anyway.

21
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,690
Except for no phone,

22
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,910
air conditioning, and Wi-Fi,

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,970
everything is good in ancient times.

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,170
What are you doing?

25
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,030
Why are there these shameless men everywhere?

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,800
What are you doing?

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,880
Sir, here are your wontons. Be careful!

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,960
It hurts!

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,430
I'm really sorry.

30
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,940
It's my first day at work and my hands and feet aren't cooperating.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,330
Bitch, do you want to die?

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,240
Brother!

33
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,800
You're asking for trouble!

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,710
Well done!

35
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,560
Daring to lay a finger on my Duke's Mansion's people,

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,930
do you want to die?

37
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,510
He looks quite handsome like this.

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,630
Your Highness, please spare me!

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,970
Your Highness, please spare me!

40
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,190
I was blind.

41
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,970
Prince Ning, I beg for your mercy!

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,050
Prince Ning, I beg for your mercy!

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,480
He doesn't deserve death.

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,800
We'll go to the government office and turn ourselves in now.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,120
Let's go.

46
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,440
Miss, despite being a delicate girl yourself,

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,270
you still stood up against evil. I admire that.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,580
Girls should support each other.

49
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,440
Thanks for your help.

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,250
It was just a small effort.

51
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,090
You don't need to thank me.

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,960
She is the maid of Duke's Mansion.

53
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,720
As the Duke, I will protect her.

54
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,440
We won't bother you anymore, Prince Ning.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,200
Goodbye.

56
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,090
I'll host a poetry meeting at my villa the day after tomorrow.

57
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,590
Miss, if you're interested,

58
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,120
you can come with Duke Chu.

59
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,510
Sure.

60
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,280
I'll definitely be there.

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Goodbye, Your Highness.

62
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,340
Why did you stop?

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,610
Don't you know about Prince Ning?

64
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,200
You talked to him too much.

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,910
So stupid.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,410
I think Prince Ning is quite nice.

67
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,070
He's handsome and gentle.

68
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,750
Most importantly, he doesn't easily resort

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,990
to threats, poisoning, or murder.

70
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,510
Candied haws!

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,780
Candied...

72
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,910
You...

73
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,030
Duke!

74
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,600
I didn't recognize you.

75
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,320
I dare not take your money.

76
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,540
You didn't get to eat it just now.

77
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,220
I'm using these to shut your mouth.

78
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,310
I achieved candied haws freedom just like that?

79
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,750
What are you waiting for?

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go.

81
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,300
At today's flower appreciation and poetry battle at Prince Ning's Mansion,

82
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,960
the winner will be rewarded with five hundred taels of silver

83
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,880
by the Empress Dowager.

84
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,430
Miss Mo, are you interested?

85
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,970
Why not give it a try?

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,010
Unfortunately, I'm not good at making seven-character and five-character poetry.

87
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,690
The most important thing about poetry is the mood.

88
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,950
You don't have to be too rigid about the form.

89
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,880
You're so open-minded, Your Highness. I'll go then.

90
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,110
Miss Mo is truly innocent and adorable.

91
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,940
It's rare in the world.

92
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,470
She is just crazy.

93
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,970
And that is indeed quite rare.

94
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,870
Everyone!

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,230
Everyone, I also composed a new poem.

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,910
The porcelain is waiting for the rain to turn celeste, while I'm waiting for you.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,200
The cooking smoke rises gently, drifting a thousand miles across the river.

98
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,710
No way. The ancient people also know Jay Chou?

99
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,150
I'm like a fish in your lotus pond.

100
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,790
Just to watch the bright moonlight with you.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,890
Oh, the fifth ring, you have one more ring than the fourth ring.

102
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:45,460
Oh, the fifth ring, you have one less ring than the sixth ring.

103
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,300
Of all the poetry,

104
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,270
why did you have to plagiarize Duke Chu's?

105
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,880
-Yes.
-They are Xiao Chu's?

106
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,310
You took the poems he wrote seven years ago,

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,820
without changing a word, and used them in the competition.

108
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,250
Shame on you.

109
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,350
Is that true?

110
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,240
Exactly.

111
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,130
Then didn't that make her a thief?

112
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,270
I thought she was quite capable.

113
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,180
Why did she leave? Why did she stop composing poems?

114
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,970
Why did she leave?

115
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,900
What's going on?

116
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,230
It looks like Miss Mo really likes

117
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,800
Duke Chu.

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,730
She even remembers his poems

119
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,490
from years ago.
