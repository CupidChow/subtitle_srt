1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,300
By the way, I don't know your name yet.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,440
My name is An Mo.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,640
I'm here…

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,440
to look for my relatives.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
Relatives?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,720
Miss An, stop pretending.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,360
I know who sent you.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,420
Please go back and tell him

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,010
that I won't inherit the title.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,640
My lifelong wish

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,120
is to travel around the Great Liang

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,400
and see the world.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,540
So, please go back and tell him

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,240
not to waste his time.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,200
Who is he?

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
You're so good at pretending.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,730
Aren't you sent by the old Emperor?

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,360
I don't know His Majesty,

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,500
but I support you in pursuing your dream.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,450
A good man should be ambitious.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,930
He doesn't have to be trapped in the court.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,239
Great.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,760
Xiao Chu.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,230
I won't let you

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,610
get involved in court disputes this time.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
No one has ever told me

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,640
what you just said.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
Thank you for saving me

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,300
and treating me to dinner.

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,250
I'll find a chance to repay you.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,330
Are you leaving?

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,160
What's wrong? You don't want me to leave?

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,280
No.

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,550
When the maid helped you to get changed,

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,920
she said she didn't see anything on you.

37
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,400
You don't have an ID document or money.

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
So, where can you go?

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,520
Miss An, this is your room.

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,640
Thank you.

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,770
By the way, Qiao'er,

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,440
is there a maid named Haitang in the mansion?

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,300
As far as I know,

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,420
there is no such a maid in the mansion.

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,800
I'll take my leave.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,960
Is there a guard named Hu Qi?

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,880
I don't think so, either.

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,020
I'll take my leave.

49
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,520
There is neither Haitang nor Hu Qi.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,360
An'an!

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,600
Xiao Chu.

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,960
Zhao Yuchan. Prince Ning.

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,160
I heard that Zhao Yuchan, the Lady of Prime Minister's Mansion,

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,240
is a beauty.

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,220
There must be a lot of people going to propose to her.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,770
Is she engaged with anyone?

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
Yuchan?

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
I guess not.

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,920
Zhao Yuzhu is not engaged yet, let alone her...

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,760
You called her "Yuchan."

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
What about the Crown Prince?

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,770
Is there a Crown Prince now?

63
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,720
Miss An,

64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,560
don't talk about national affairs at will.

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,800
Although His Majesty treats me like his own son,

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
if others hear

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,140
what you said just now,

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,250
even I won't be able to save your life, either.

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm just curious. Just tell me.

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,240
His Majesty has no children now,

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
so he hasn't appointed the Crown Prince yet.

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,720
What about his brothers?

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,720
Are you talking about Prince Ning?

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,450
He's far away in his fief.
I'm afraid he won't return to the capital.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,720
So, Prince Ning is still in the fief.

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Then, I just need to get rid of Zhao Yuchan.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,659
What are you murmuring about?

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,560
Nothing.

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,240
Then, Young Master Xiao,

80
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
can you take me to meet

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,000
the Lady of Prime Minister's Mansion?

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
I have admired her for a long time.

83
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,640
First, get close to Zhao Yuchan and gain her trust.

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,690
Then, find a chance to kill her.

85
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,560
No.

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,280
Why not?

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,680
Just because.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm sure Yuchan's not here.

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Go over there.

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,780
Young Master Xiao,

91
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
I thought you wouldn't dare to come.

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
Young Master Xiao, where are you going?

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,250
The poetry meeting is here.

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,000
Get lost!

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,670
Don't.

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,159
We hold this poetry meeting

97
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,720
for you.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,120
With your talent,

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,400
it's easy for you

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,560
to win first place in this poetry meeting.

101
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,680
Am I right?

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,720
Yes, that's right.

103
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,450
Definitely.

104
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,710
What's going on?

105
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,600
Didn't you see?

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,330
They're inviting me to their poetry meeting.

107
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,120
Just join it, then. Why are you so afraid?

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,680
Are you afraid of losing?

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Right. Everyone bet against you.

110
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
Nonsense!

111
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
I bet on Xiao Chu.

112
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,680
It's just a poem battle. We're not afraid.

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,000
If you lose all your money,

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
don't come and beg His Highness.

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,560
Do you want me to be embarrassed to death?

116
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Trust me.

117
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Mr. Zhu! Mr. Zhu! Mr. Zhu!

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,120
Young Master Xiao! Young Master Xiao!

119
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,680
Mr. Zhu! Mr. Zhu! Mr. Zhu!

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,409
Young Master Xiao, please.

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
It's snowing in the ten-mile pavilion.

122
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,560
I started to have grey hair, and one day seemed like a year for me.

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,840
Good.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Forget about right or wrong, gratitude or resentment.

125
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,120
Just keep your being healthy and happy in your heart.

126
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,680
Good.

127
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,120
Young Master Xiao, it's your turn.

128
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,080
There's no rush, Young Master Xiao.

129
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,120
Take your time.

130
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,000
I have plenty of time to play with you.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,680
Yes.

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,280
It's raining. Trees and weeds overgrow in my hometown.

133
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,159
I heard that you are still guarding the lone city.

134
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,560
The sound of a reed pipe arises in the suburb

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,880
and reaches that desolate village.

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,280
Destiny takes its root,

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
which is us.

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,560
I've got it!

139
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,280
The past days are like the ever-flowing rivers.

140
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,880
They drifted away from me and couldn't be kept.

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,600
The present-day disturbs me and makes me distraught.

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
The water still flows even if you try to cut it with a sword.

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Raise the cup to drown your sorrows, yet the sorrows grow.

144
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,160
The breeze will blow in every direction tomorrow morning.

145
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,560
Good poem.

146
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,800
Good poem.

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,860
Young Master Xiao really deserves his fame.

148
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,039
Young Master Xiao.

149
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,100
Young Master Xiao.

150
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Your poems are good.

151
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
Write some more for me.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,860
I can use them to deal with people.

153
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,040
You won it.

154
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,240
Okay. I'll write a whole book for you.

155
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,680
Take me to see Zhao Yuchan now.

156
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,440
You still remember it? Let's go.

157
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
You could have copied anyone,

158
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,610
but why do you have to copy Duke Chu?

159
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,360
Exactly.

160
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,990
Exactly.

161
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,680
Isn't that plagiarism?

162
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,010
I came here for nothing.

163
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
I see.

164
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,120
Do you want to burn me to death?
