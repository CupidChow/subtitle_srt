I'm not going to marry him.

8
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,750
Have you made up your mind?

9
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,470
Everyone, Prince Ning is treacherous and wants to start a rebellion.

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,480
You should see his true colors.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,740
Don't be fooled by him.

12
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,660
Yes. She is right.

13
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,550
I do want to overthrow the emperor today.

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,350
Prince Ning,

15
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,680
as long as I'm still alive, don't expect to usurp the throne.

16
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,400
Your Majesty, I'm doing this

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,150
to protect Great Liang

18
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,770

19
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,979
Nonsense!

20
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,750
What you are up to is obvious.

21
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,630
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,080
I advise you to prioritize the overall situation.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,400
If you step down voluntarily,

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,890
I can guarantee that everyone here today

25
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,260
can stay alive.

26
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,200
Prince Ning, this is disrespectful.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,040
We swear to share weal and woe with His Majesty.

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,790

What are you doing?

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,800
It's an eyesore. Take it off.

46
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,070
An eyesore?

47
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
This is the first time I wear a wedding dress. I'm not going to take it off.

She's also the only woman I want to marry.

54
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,130
I have understood something recently.

55
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,470
Loving someone is not confining her,

56
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,730
but giving her what she wants.

57
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,590
An'an,

58
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,670

Honey.

77
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,870
When the court situation is stable, I will resign.

78
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,290
Then let's leave the capital.

Don't go back on your word.

86

You can't disappear again.

87

But if...

88
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
There's no if.

How could you get married so hastily?

97
