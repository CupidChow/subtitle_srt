[Lovesickness]

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,790
[Episode 5]

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,510
Xiao Chu

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,560
must be from the modern times, too.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,490
Otherwise, how would he know the song of Five Rings?

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,350
Miss Mo.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,070
Hi, Empress Dowager.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,830
Miss Mo, you're indeed unconstrained and graceful in bearing.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,350
How could you be willing to be a maid

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,780
in Duke's Mansion?

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,190
I didn't expect

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,170
that Duke Chu would kidnap a commoner.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,940
Shut up! Duke Chu is not that kind of person.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,350
But I can't blame him.

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,150
Miss Mo, you just look so much like my sister.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,340
Not only your appearance and behavior

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,390
but your temperament is also almost the same.

19
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,910
Who is your sister?

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,960
Speaking of her, although we are not of the same blood,

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,080
she's far better than my biological sister.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,039
Before entering the palace,

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,400
I had a hard time at the Prime Minister's Mansion.

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,830
Luckily, my sister and Duke Chu

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,520
had always been planning the future for me.

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,220
Then she and Xiao Chu...

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,530
My sister and Duke Chu loved each other very much,

28
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,259
but seven years ago, she left without saying goodbye.

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,840
There has been no news from her ever since.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,870
Since then, Duke Chu has completely changed.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,430
Maybe your presence

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,720
can give him a sense of comfort.

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,250
Me?

34
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,960
But it's not fair to you.

35
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,280
I can't believe I'm living

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,440
in such a cheesy plot of substitution!

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,590
Can I be more unlucky?

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,390
Miss Mo, are you okay?

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,590
Prince Ning, I'm fine.

40
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,380
Were you blind?

41
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,530
How could you fall from above?

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,470
I was pushed down.

43
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,680
I saw that person.

44
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,350
She was wearing pink clothes

45
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,880
and a silver pearl hairpin.

46
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,010
How dare someone commit a crime
at my poetry club?

47
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,830
Guards!

48
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,520
No need.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,190
in the Duke's Mansion.

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,790
Don't worry about it, Prince Ning.

51
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,140
Your Grace, I'll take my leave.

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,060
I...

53
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,390
Investigate every person present in Prince Ning's poetry club.

54
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,470
Don't miss a soul.

55
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,760
Yes.

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,400
Why didn't you let Prince Ning find the murderer?

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,280
Is a maid's life so worthless?

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,029
Do you really think the murderer can be found out?

59
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,089
Since she dared to commit a crime in public,

60
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,720
someone must be behind her.

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Could you find her with just a clue about the dress?

62
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,030
Even if you found her,

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,800
how sure would you be to make her confess?

64
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,930
Still, you can't pretend nothing happened.

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,980
That was an attempted murder.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
You said it was attempted yourself.

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,490
Xiao Chu, please think straight.

68
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,070
I'm not the one who abandoned you.

69
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,630
Why are you taking it out on me?

70
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,750
Just because I look like her?

71
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,310
Shut up!

72
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,050
I won't.

73
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,460
You have no humanity.

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,680
You are a cold-blooded and heartless jerk!

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,030
No wonder you were abandoned.

76
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,360
If I were her, I wouldn't want you, either!

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,390
Say that again.

78
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,460
If I were her, I...

79
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,830
Say that again?

80
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,010
Your Grace, Prince Ning is asking for an audience.

81
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,130
What does he want?

82
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,960
Let him in.

83
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes.

84
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,470
Greetings, Your Grace.

85
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,180
Rise.

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,060
Thank you, Your Grace.

87
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,500
What happened today… did you do it?

88
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,270
Your Grace, aren't you curious

89
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,560
what the relationship between Duke Chu and Miss Mo is?

90
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,830
She's just a maid

91
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,120
in the Duke's Mansion.

92
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,430
But according to my observation,

93
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,870
he and Miss Mo

94
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,280
have been together all day long these days.

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,540
They are very close.

96
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,100
Prince Ning, what do you mean? Just say it.

97
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,870
Don't you understand yet?

98
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,360
Xiao Chu is in a high position now.

99
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,950
And he has a beautiful woman beside him.

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,950
How would he respect you,

101
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,890
the Empress Dowager?

102
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,290
If you want your wish to come true,

103
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,659
only by weakening his power

104
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,830
can he rely on you.

105
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,150
Am I not right?

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,860
Indeed, it's dirty. I can't use it anymore.

107
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,270
Whether you're her or not,

108
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,350
I won't let you take him away this time.
