[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,320
Did you successfully confess your love last night?

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,040
I...

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,610
Come with me.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,080
Go in.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,080
Now?

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,320
Xiao Chu.

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,440
Last night...

9
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,200
Xiao Chu,

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,360
come to my room later.

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,360
I have something to tell you.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,680
An Mo.

13
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,680
Brother Xiao Chu, don't come in.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,479
Yuchan, why are you here?

15
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,360
Just come in.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
If you see her body,

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,360
I don't believe you won't take the responsibility.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,560
I... I'm leaving now.

19
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,680
Don't move.

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
Brother Xiao Chu, save me!

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
An Mo?

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,720
Sister An, why are you here?

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,400
I... I just wanted to make a joke.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,800
An Mo.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,800
I...

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,330
Sister An, I know what you mean.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
But I don't want

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
to do it this way.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,120
Sorry. I see.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,320
Miss An. Miss An.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,360
What's wrong?

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Come with me to check on His Highness now.

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
His Highness is very sick.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,730
He wouldn't go to the doctor or take medicine.

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,480
I feel so uncomfortable.

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I think it feels a bit hot. I'm going to get you a doctor.

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
No need for that.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
Don't be stubborn.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,760
I don't need you to care about me.

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,810
I want to care about you.

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,730
Who are you to care about me?

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Who are you to me?

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
I just want to care about you.

44
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,940
Then...

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
does what happened that night still count?

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,680
I was drunk. I don't remember anything.

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm going to make medicine for you.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,640
You remember what happened that night?

49
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
Brother Xiao Chu.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Yu... Yuchan.

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,810
Why... Why are you here?

52
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,680
Sister An told me you are sick.

53
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,640
So I specially came here to check on you.

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,910
It took Sister An two hours

55
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,920
to make the medicine.

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Brother Xiao Chu,

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,360
don't be mad at her.

58
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,090
Don't think I can't tell

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,080
she wants to make us a couple.

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,400
Can't she tell

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,920
we are just like brother and sister?

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,120
No, it's not like this, Brother Xiao Chu.

63
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,240
When I first met you

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,520
in the palace,

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,680
I fell in love with you.

66
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,840
I've liked you all these years.

67
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,760
Yu... Yuchan, you...

68
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,090
Brother Xiao Chu, do you...

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,520
not like me at all?

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm sorry, Yuchan.

71
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,400
All this time,

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,100
I've always treated you as my own sister.

73
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Actually, I already have a girl I love.

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Looks like it's just my wishful thinking.

75
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,840
What's wrong?

76
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,780
Did Xiao Chu bully you?

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,800
If I had known this,

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,050
I shouldn't have done it to humiliate myself.

79
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,920
Are you crazy? Why are you drinking when you're sick?

80
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,890
It's none of your business.

81
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,240
An Mo,

82
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,320
why did you make a fool of me again and again?

83
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,520
I didn't make a fool of you. I just...

84
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,800
You just don't care about my feelings.

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
You don't care about what I want.

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,840
You don't care if I'm heartbroken or not.

87
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,700
You just pushed me to Zhao Yuchan.

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,920
Do you hate me so much?

89
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,360
An Mo,

90
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,240
what on earth do you take me for?

91
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
An Mo,

92
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
if you really hate me,

93
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,040
push me away now.

94
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,370
I won't pester you anymore.

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
Enough, Xiao Chu.

96
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,240
I do hate you.

97
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,540
I don't believe it.

98
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,970
I don't believe it. Because...

99
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,880
Do you know why

100
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,450
I pushed you to Zhao Yuchan?

101
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
Because I don't want

102
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,480
to have anything to do with you.

103
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Then why did you cry for me?

104
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,840
Don't flatter yourself.

105
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
You are not worth my tears.

106
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,080
Fine.

107
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,390
An Mo,

108
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,200
I really wish

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
I had never met you.

110
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Never.

111
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,640
Xiao Chu, I'm sorry.

112
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,000
This time, I pushed you away myself.

113
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,000
Miss, the dishes are all here. Enjoy your meal.

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
Wait. Where is His Highness?

115
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,420
His Highness said he doesn't want to see you for the time being.

116
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,760
If he doesn't want to eat, fine.

117
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,960
These delicious dishes are all mine.

118
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,820
Delicious.

119
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,320
I just want you to live well.
