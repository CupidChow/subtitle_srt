00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:26,080
Wearing red clothes, I'm lovesick.

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:37,480
I'm already worried before calling you Darling.

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Killing time in the daytime...

5
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,760
Brother Xiao Chu, when do you like enjoying opera?

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,610
He has cleaned up all the music houses.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,530
Now he doesn't have a place to enjoy music.

8
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,430
It was all because of you.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
I heard about it long ago.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,040
Sister An, I didn't expect it was because of you.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,520
Because I'm unlucky.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Just enjoy opera.

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,400
... came here.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:25,280
Miss, I love you

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:38,640
very much.

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,880
Love once begun, will never end.

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,370
The lovers may die for love,

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,410
and the dead in love may revive.

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,860
If I can have this kind of love, I don't care if I'm alive or dead.

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,169
Well,

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,639
what kind of opera did you ask for?

22
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,080
It's all about love. It's so boring.

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,920
Seriously? What's in the opera is not real.

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,680
Although it's not real, the love is real.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
Nonsense.

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,000
Love is so vulnerable in front of life and death.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How can it transcend life and death?

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
What you don't know may still exist.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
So you know?

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,280
Brother Xiao Chu, Sister An,

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,079
don't get angry because of an opera.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,040
Of course I know. You're the one who doesn't know.

33
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,930
Why should I be angry with him?

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,410
He doesn't remember me.

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,880
Remember what?

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,410
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,880
Try it.

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
I think you are very strange.

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
Strange?

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
Why?

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,760
Sometimes,

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
you make me feel familiar.

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,040
But sometimes, I feel like you're a stranger.

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,480
Anyway, sometimes I feel we are close and sometimes I feel we are distant.

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,920
Your Highness, humans are complicated.

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,650
What makes you say that?

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,560
I don't know what I should do.

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Let me put it this way. The dog and the bunny are a couple.

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,610
They love each other very much.

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,680
But the pig and the dog are childhood sweethearts.

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
In order to have the dog,

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,880
the pig collaborated with a bad guy.

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,440
They killed the bunny.

54
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,800
In the end, the dog was killed too.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
But now,

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
if God has given them a chance,

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,080
what do you think the bunny should do?

58
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,320
It's easy. Take action first.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,450
Kill the pig.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,880
But the pig is quite pitiful.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,730
If it weren't for the bunny,

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,170
it wouldn't have become like this.

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,080
Then let the dog and the pig be together.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,640
Then no one will die.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
B-But...

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,200
the dog and the bunny are supposed to be a couple.

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,880
Isn't staying alive more important than love?

68
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,760
Isn't staying alive more important than love?

69
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,000
I will never let you be with Xiao Chu.

70
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,320
Your appearance will only harm him again.

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,480
That's right.

72
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,320
As long as you are with Zhao Yuchan,

73
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,240
you can live well.

74
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,240
If you want to eat anything, you can just tell the maid.

75
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,760
You don't have to cook personally.

76
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,680
No.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
Today is your birthday.

78
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,280
I must cook something for you.

79
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,880
How did you know my birthday?

80
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,580
I heard it from the butler.

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,810
What are you making?

82
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,840
A birthday cake.

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't find any ingredient in your era.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
So I can only make a large-size osmanthus cake.

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,740
Let me help you.

86
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,880
What should I do?

87
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
We should add water, right?

88
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,440
I know.

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,570
No need for that.

90
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,850
Add more.

91
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,600
No need.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,920
Too much water. Add some flour.

93
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm just doing what I can.

94
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,320
Don't worry about me.

95
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,840
Go away.

96
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,880
It's spilt.

97
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't spill it on me.

98
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,880
Look... Look at you.

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,680
Look at you. It's the same as last time.

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Last time? When?

101
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,960
Nothing.

102
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
Honey.

103
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800
Happy birthday.

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I have never celebrated my birthday

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,660
since my parents passed away.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,260
I'm going to celebrate it with you today.

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,240
Actually, I really hope I can accompany you forever.

108
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,900
You can be Mr. Wang's legal wife if you marry him.

109
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Why did you refuse?

110
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,010
Don't mention it again.

111
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I won't marry him.

112
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,280
Yuchan.

113
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,240
Sister An.

114
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
What brings you here today? Have a seat.

115
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,240
You may leave.

116
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,480
I heard someone came to propose a marriage.

117
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,020
I would rather die than marry him.

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
Are you willing to marry Xiao Chu?
