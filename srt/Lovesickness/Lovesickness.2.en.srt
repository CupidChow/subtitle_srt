[Lovesickness]

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,720
[Episode 2]

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,300
So, are you going to keep

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,400
pretending not to know me?

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,870
Do I know you?

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,220
You're from Sanlitun, too?

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,990
Fine. Since you said you didn't know me,

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,390
why did you suddenly show up yesterday?

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,380
How would I know?

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,910
I don't even know what place this is.

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,270
Stop playing dumb.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,130
Where do you think you are?

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,380
I don't know you.

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,190
I'm not from here.

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,280
I want to go home.

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,980
Enough!

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,110
In that case,

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,200
you could stay in my mansion

20
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,540
as a maid.

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,350
Don't dream of leaving.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,270
Why should I?

23
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,390
Because I put poison in your bowl.

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,410
If you don't do as I command,

25
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,880
you'll be tortured to death.

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,950
You pervert!

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,690
You want me to be your maid?

28
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,470
In your next life!

29
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,280
[A light gentle breeze]

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,400
In dramas, when a girl travels through time,

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,180
she'll be either a princess or a daughter of a noble family.

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,060
Why do I have to become a maid?

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,789
Wait.

34
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,850
Why did I travel through time in the first place?

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,390
It's that jade thumb ring.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,680
I can go home once I find that ring.

37
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,770
But where is it?

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,120
Your Lordship, the assassin is dead.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,450
We got nothing from him.

40
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,050
Your Lordship.

41
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,030
Your Lordship, this woman's identity is unknown.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,870
If you keep her beside you, I'm afraid...

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,600
She has nothing to do with this.

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,640
I have other plans for her.

45
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,230
Yes.

46
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,790
No matter how you play dumb,

47
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,140
I won't let you go this time.

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,230
[Duke's Mansion]

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,400
Find the antidote first

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
and leave this darn place alive.

51
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,310
Is he drunk?

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,450
Great!

53
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,840
There must be a secret room.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,040
That's what's always like in TV dramas.

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,900
Pervert.

56
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,630
I haven't eaten yet.

57
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,840
And he was having delicacies here.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,720
I can't believe he has the jade thumb ring!

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
I'm dreaming of you again.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,240
What's going on?

61
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,950
I...

62
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,270
Lecher!

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
I'll kill you!

64
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,280
Why did you leave me behind?

65
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,540
Don't leave ever again.

66
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,420
Who is he mistaking me for?

67
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,110
This pervert is quite infatuated.

68
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,159
I...

69
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,110
Why are you here?

70
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,030
You held me tight last night.

71
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,550
Why do you turn your back on me the minute you wake up?

72
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,880
Stop talking nonsense.

73
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,020
Your Lordship, I'm here to get you changed.

74
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,150
No need. You may leave.

75
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,340
Yes.

76
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,430
Let me do it.

77
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,950
Have you touched enough?

78
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,090
Where is the jade thumb ring?

79
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,900
This?

80
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,400
Yes, that's it.

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,520
It can prove that I'm not from this era.

82
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,020
I came here because of it.

83
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,470
I can go back with it.

84
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,350
Give it to me.

85
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,890
Give it to me!
