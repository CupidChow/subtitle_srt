[Episode 10]

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,340
Hu Qi, protect His Majesty.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,950
Stay by his side before I come back.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,560
Your Lordship, you...

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,240
Yes, Your Lordship.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,520
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,230
I will bring Mo An'an back safely.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,190
This is the other half of the Tiger Tally

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,790
that you gave me to command the three armies.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,220
I'm returning it to you now.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,260
You must keep it yourself.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,960
Even if I am not by your side in the future,

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,190
I believe you can do it on your own.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,730
Duke Chu,

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,880
I order you to return safely.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,790
This is an imperial edict.

19
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,190
I forbid you to go.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,080
Your Grace.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,530
This is too dangerous. You are not allowed to go.

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,570
I have to go.

23
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,340
Why? Why?

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,350
She already abandoned you back then.

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,080
Why do you still want to risk your life to save her?

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,550
Because she is my life.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,650
Xiao Chu, you fool.

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,539
Let her go, Prince Ning.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,199
Duke Chu, you deserve your reputation.

30
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,100
I'll cut to the chase then.

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,430
Give it to me.

32
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,540
Let her go.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,370
Toss it over here first.

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,430
It's a trap!

35
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,620
Trying to escape?

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,840
Xiao Chu.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,690
Xiao Chu.

38
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,660
Xiao Chu.

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,060
Xiao Chu, are you okay?

40
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,050
Xiao Chu.

41
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm not dead yet.

42
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Don't cry.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,260
Leave. Hurry.

44
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm not leaving. Let's leave together.

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
Mo An'an.

46
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,000
Stop talking.

47
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,940
I won't leave you behind.

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,500
At worst, we'll die together.

49
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,920
You fool.

50
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,829
You're calling me a fool. What about you?

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm just a substitute. Is it worth it?

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,150
I told you

53
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,450
you are never a substitute.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,510
Do you still not understand

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,880
my feelings for you till now?

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,530
I...

57
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,200
Your Grace, why are you angry?

58
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,020
Is it just because Xiao Chu

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,570
went to save Mo An'an alone?

60
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,570
Prince Ning, what you did is a rebellion!

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,810
Rebellion?

62
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,909
His Majesty is weak and incompetent.

63
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,159
The court is under the control of an outsider.

64
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,970
You're calling me a rebel?

65
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,680
I just want to take back

66
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,810
what belongs to me.

67
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,050
No matter what you do,

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,770
you'll only be defeated by Xiao Chu in the end.

69
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,750
Your Grace,

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I advise you to be sensible.

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,620
Give His Majesty to me.

72
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,530
I guarantee you can still live a wealthy and noble life for the rest of your life.

73
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,880
Let me go. Let me go!

74
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,840
Prince Ning, what are you doing? Let go of my mother!

75
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,460
Guards!

76
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,760
Be careful, Your Majesty.

77
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,530
Xiao Chu.

78
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,310
Xiao Chu.

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,900
Xiao Chu.

80
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,110
An'an.

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,270
Leave.

82
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,970
Xiao Chu, I'm sorry. Sorry.

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,260
I won't leave.

84
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,940
Don't die, okay?

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,670
Leave.

86
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,960
Xiao Chu.

87
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,740
Leave!

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
Leave!

89
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,390
Xiao Chu, I'm sorry. Sorry.

90
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,460
I won't leave.

91
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,650
Don't die, okay?

92
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,040
I understand your feelings.

93
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,180
I like you too.

94
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,240
Don't leave me behind.

95
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,430
Xiao Chu.

96
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,960
Xiao Chu.

97
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,040
Duke Chu.

98
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,580
Duke Chu.

99
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,510
Duke Chu.

100
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,220
I'm going to kill you!

101
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,000
Miss Mo,

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
I understand the sadness in your heart.

103
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,050
I'm going to let this go.

104
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,850
Duke Chu was unparalleled.

105
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,930
Unfortunately, he died young.

106
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,690
It's really a loss to Great Liang.

107
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,870
Prince Ning's hypocrisy is unparalleled.

108
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,150
Miss Mo,

109
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,400
since Duke Chu is dead,

110
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,220
why don't you marry me?

111
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,990
I can also guarantee you'll live a wealthy and noble life

112
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,270
for the rest of your life.

113
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,350
Who do you think you are?

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,220
Looks like you're unwilling.

115
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,490
I'd rather die than marry you.

116
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,460
I will take everything

117
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,910
that belongs to Xiao Chu.

118
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,910
An'an.

119
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,730
Prince Ning, what are you doing?

120
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,330
Prince Ning, you are starting a rebellion!

121
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,030
I agree.

122
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,030
I agree to marry you.
