00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,480
I heard that Yuchan is going to marry into the palace.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,240
The Emperor is old enough to be her father.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,360
How can she marry him?

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,090
An Mo, don't speak recklessly.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,900
Originally, it should have been Zhao Yuzhu.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,440
But she refused.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,920
She refused?

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,610
So she passed it on to someone else?

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
She has no choice.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,160
Because she is just an illegitimate daughter.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,520
So what?

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,640
Are illegitimate daughters not human beings?

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,440
Are they meant to be trampled on?

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,120
From ancient times,

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,480
emperors and ministers have been using marriage

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
to stabilize their relationship.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,850
Moreover, the Prime Minister is deeply trusted by His Majesty.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,480
After Yuchan marries into the palace,

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,240
she probably won't be bullied like she is now.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,800
If your men's authority

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,640
depends on sacrificing women's happiness

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
to secure,

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,220
then it's just too sad.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
No. I have to go find her.

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,380
I can't let her marry into the palace.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Are you crazy? Defying the imperial decree is a serious crime.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,760
I'd rather die than let her marry into the palace!

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,690
If she enters the palace, everything will be ruined!

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Calm down.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's think it over carefully.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,200
There will be a solution.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
No, absolutely not.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,400
The entire Prime Minister's Mansion

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,259
will be implicated because of me.

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,479
That won't happen.

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,960
You and Zhao Yuzhu are both ladies of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
You two are equal.

39
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,560
Don't you know it should have been her originally?

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,400
How could I not know?

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
But I'm just an illegitimate daughter.

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,560
She refused, so it has to be me.

43
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,960
Why?

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,420
Women have the right to choose their own marriages.

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,880
We should decide our own destiny.

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,199
My fate is in my own hands.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
My fate is in my own hands?

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
Sister, what do you think I should do?

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,780
The temple fair is in two days.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
At 8 p.m. that day,

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
Xiao Chu and I will be waiting for you at the back door.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,840
After we meet,

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,780
quickly slip away while they are busy and not paying attention to you.

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
As long as Yuchan doesn't marry into the palace

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
and then become the Empress Dowager,

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,280
Xiao Chu won't die, I think.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,200
And Yuchan will be happier.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Just now, Yuchan sent a maid to deliver a letter,

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
saying that there are many people at the back door of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,720
She will find an opportunity to slip away.

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,780
And she told us to wait for her directly at the city gate.

62
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,360
My dear sister.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,120
Sister?

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
Where are you going?

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,640
I...

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
Let me guess.

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,640
You're not waiting for that An Mo to take you away, are you?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
You're so naive.

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,280
Do you know why I'm here?

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,690
It was because your good sister, An Mo,

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
told me herself.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,710
It has been a long time

73
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,400
since she couldn't stand seeing you shamelessly

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
chasing after Xiao Chu every day.

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,620
I don't believe it.

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,850
Sister An would never say that.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
You don't believe it?

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
Then I'll personally take you to see.

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
What are you doing?

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,260
What are you doing?

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,200
Let go of me! Let go of me!

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,010
Why hasn't Yuchan arrived yet?

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
Did something happen to her?

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,130
Don't worry for now.

85
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,920
She might have been delayed by something else.

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,000
It's cold. Why didn't you wear more?

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
See?

88
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,920
They're having a sweet date.

89
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,470
They don't have time to take care of you.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,700
I don't believe it.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,570
I'll go and ask them myself.

92
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,300
You're so ungrateful!

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
I advise you to behave yourself.

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,920
I'll make sure you marry into the palace in glory.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,040
Let go of me!

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,320
My Lady!

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Your face!

98
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,920
My Lady!

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
Something must have gone wrong.

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,850
I'll go to the Prime Minister's Mansion again tomorrow.

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
What's wrong?

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,500
Why are you so determined to help her?

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Forget it. Just consider it as me pitying her.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,440
She's going to the palace to become a consort.

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,830
Why do you pity her?

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Yuchan,

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,730
why didn't you come last night?

108
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,600
My sister found out.

109
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,280
Well, why don't we leave now?

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,310
No need.

111
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Sister An.

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,330
I've decided to marry into the palace.

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Didn't we agree to...

114
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,650
Zhao Yuzhu's face was ruined by me.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,930
So, I'm the only one who can marry into the palace now.

116
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
Sister An, you should congratulate me.

117
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,680
I'm going to marry into the palace and enjoy wealth and glory.

118
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,560
Yuchan,

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
you must not be so reckless.

120
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,720
Do you have any other way?

121
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,040
Sister An,

122
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,400
I used to really see you

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,880
as my own sister.

124
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
But Sister An,

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,290
do you really see me as your own sister?

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,760
Of course.

127
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,840
You're always good at acting.

128
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,180
Isn't it just because you pity me?

129
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
No, Yuchen.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
How could that be? You misunderstood me.

131
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,880
I didn't.

132
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
I just finally figured it out.

133
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,640
In terms of appearance and talent, you're inferior to me.

134
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,240
Yet, you intentionally led me to pursue Brother Xiao Chu,

135
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,000
causing me to lose face in front of him,

136
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,880
just to highlight your uniqueness.

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,600
Yuchan, it's really not like that.

138
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,040
If you had never appeared,

139
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,460
it would have been so much better.

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
What do you mean?

141
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Sister An.

142
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,880
This is the last time I call you sister.

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
In one of these two cups of wine,

144
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,600
I've added the Dream Powder.

145
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Whoever drinks it

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
will silently die in their sleep

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,559
within seven days.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Didn't you say that our fate is in our own hands?

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,919
Let's each take a cup.

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,390
Let fate decide who lives and who dies.

151
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,920
Yuchan!

152
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,810
If you want me to die, it's easy.

153
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
But before I die,

154
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
you must promise me one thing.

155
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,960
What is it?

156
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
In the future,

157
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,160
no matter what happens,

158
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
you must never, ever,

159
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,720
ever harm Xiao Chu.

160
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,090
How could I ever harm Brother Xiao Chu?

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm glad to hear that.

163
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,020
Remember what you said today.

164
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,840
Never harm him.

165
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
I know you won't believe

166
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
anything I say now.

167
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,800
But Yuchan,

168
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,060
I've been truly treating you sincerely.

169
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,040
You forced me to do it.

170
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,720
You forced me to do it.

171
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
You forced me to do it!

172
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,040
From now on,

173
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
I'll never allow anyone to betray me.

174
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Never.
