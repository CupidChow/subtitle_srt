1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,440
You're awake.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,930
I can give you more money

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,540
as long as you let me go.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,080
It's not about money.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,840
I can't break the rules.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,130
I know the young master of Duke Chu's Mansion.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,280
Aren't you afraid he'll hold you accountable?

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,520
You're hilarious.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,210
Most of the girls in my place

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,360
said that.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,760
Can you invent something new?

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,200
Xiao Chu, you playboy.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
By the way,

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,000
I advise you to be good.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Otherwise, you will suffer.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm not someone you wanna mess with.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,360
Got it?

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
Forget it. My life is more important.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,039
I'll be good.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,560
Give me an orientation tour first.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,190
Including the content of the work.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,400
What? Content of the work?

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,760
Well, for example,

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,120
how to entertain customers.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm a woman from a good family.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
How can I know how to do it if I don't see more?

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,080
You are quite interesting.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
Long time no see.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,479
Please.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,360
Please.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,720
Gentlemen,

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,640
please.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
This one is good.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,940
That girl is pretty interesting.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,600
I like her.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,600
Good.

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,320
Lecher!

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,760
Lecher!

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,889
Chippy! You don't let me touch you?

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,200
Go away!

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,960
Come here!

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,720
Guards! Chase her!

44
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,920
Stop!

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Stop!

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,079
Stop! Stop!

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,640
Stop! Stop!

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,280
Chippy! Where are you going?

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,530
What are you looking at? Go!

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,280
Stop! Stop! Stop!

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
You played very well.

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,560
Go on.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,100
It's so high. At worst I'll come back if I'm dead.

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Miss An?

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
Why do you want to die?

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
Why is it you?

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
Why can't it be me?

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
Stop!

60
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,360
Where is she?

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Y-Your Highness.

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,800
The new girl doesn't know the rules.

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,000
She offended you.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
I apologize to you.

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,570
It seems that the rumor is true.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,090
How dare you force girls from good families into prostitution?

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,280
No, no, Your Highness.

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,480
You can't be fooled by this little vamp.

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
Her parents sold her to me.

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,640
Nonsense!

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,500
But she just left the Duke's Mansion yesterday.

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
And she was sold here by her parents today?

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Your Highness, please spare my life.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Move aside!

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,200
Move!

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,279
Your Highness.

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,529
Where is she?

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,360
Kneel!

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,720
Please spare our lives, Your Highness!

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,520
Please spare us!

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
We didn't know.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,930
Please spare us.

83
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,640
My Lady.

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Brother Xiao Chu and Sister An are here?

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
I heard that Young Master Xiao

86
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,280
regulated all the brothels and clip joints

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,560
for a prostitute.

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,080
People all say

89
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,520
that Young Master Xiao flipped out for a beauty.

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,120
My Lady, if you invite him here right now, I'm afraid...

91
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,920
Don't make a fuss.

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,560
Brother Xiao Chu is just playing

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,840
with those girls.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
Lady Yuchan, Lady Yuzhu wants you to go to the backyard.

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,400
My Lady.

96
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,090
Put away the handkerchief.

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
Do you really think you're the Lady of Prime Minister's Mansion?

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,890
Your mother is a lowly maid, and so are you!

99
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
And that Xiao Chu.

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,700
He's just a playboy without parents.

101
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,020
Just because His Majesty favors him,

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,780
do you really think I dare not do anything to him?

103
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,640
Brother Xiao Chu is not a playboy.

104
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,240
Don't talk about him like that.

105
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,500
How dare you talk back?

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
That lunatic.

107
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,640
She's hitting people for no reason again.

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
No, I can't stand it anymore.

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,560
Stop it!

110
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,400
How rude! Do you want to die?

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,280
Lowly…

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,080
Lady Yuzhu.

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
Xiao Chu, are you crazy?

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
This is the Prime Minister's Mansion.

115
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
So what?

116
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,400
If I see you bully Yuchan again,

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
within a day,

118
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,940
everyone in the capital will know

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,960
the legitimate daughter of the Prime Minister is a virtueless lunatic.

120
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,680
You...

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
We should teach Zhao Yuzhu a lesson.

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,240
She should have the taste of being whipped.

123
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm used to it.

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,920
It's good that you're not hurt.

125
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Does she always treat you like this?

126
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,960
Since young,

127
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
as long as she's in a bad mood,

128
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,480
she will take it out on me.

129
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,820
How can she be so cruel?

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,530
You are sisters, after all.

131
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
I've never felt we were sisters in any way.

132
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
But Miss An, when you

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,520
rushed to protect me,

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
you were more like a sister to me.

135
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
Isn't that just in human nature?

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,020
Didn't I come here to kill her?

137
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,240
How about we become sworn sisters?

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
What do you think?

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,000
Sister An.

140
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,920
What's going on?
