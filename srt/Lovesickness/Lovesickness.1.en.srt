00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,870
[Episode 1]

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:12,990
Recently,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,660
during the ongoing archeological excavation of the ancient tomb of some nobleman,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,570
we've made a significant discovery.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,930
This is a sincere ancient love letter.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,470
According to experts,

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,020
the tomb owner is most likely to be

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,390
Duke Chu of Great Liang.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,150
Excuse me.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,730
Excuse me. Thank you.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,700
An'an, look.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,500
It's really a love poem written by the tomb owner to his lover.

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,160
People all say love is bitter.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,760
Even so, I still don't regret it.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,450
When can I meet

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,550
such a loyal man?

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,090
A man's promise…

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,720
Especially in ancient times, men could have many concubines besides his…

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,120
wife.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,890
Is that a thumb ring?

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,120
Why does it look so familiar?

24
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,560
Where is it?

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,350
Found it!

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,509
Exactly the same.

27
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,390
Am I really going rich?

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,050
People all say love is bitter.

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,070
Even so, I still don't regret it.

30
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,829
What's going on?

31
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,079
What are you doing, Mister?

32
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,880
Are you filming some drama?

33
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,700
Gosh, you're so serious.

34
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,829
-Director, who is the director?
-Stop!

35
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,450
-Stop filming! Stop!
-Freeze!

36
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,550
The special effect is so real.

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,990
It's you.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,980
You know me?

39
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,830
Blood.

40
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,720
Someone died.

41
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,360
Someone really died.

42
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,310
What the heck is this place?

43
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,460
I've travelled through time?

44
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,050
Extreme bad luck!

45
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,980
Extreme bad luck!

46
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,820
Ghost!

47
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,360
Miss.

48
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,120
I observed the stars at night.

49
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,380
I found a star of calamity appeared indistinctly,
and the Emperor Star Ziwei was dim.

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,730
This is an omen of extreme bad luck.

51
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,170
So, you were not talking about me.

52
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,250
You are a jinx yourself.

53
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,470
This isn't somewhere you shouldn't be.

54
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,420
Now you're talking! Do you think I want to be here?

55
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,440
Then, what is this place?

56
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,270
This is the dungeon of the Duke Chu's Mansion

57
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,110
Duke Chu?

58
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,260
Duke Chu,

59
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,750
the man who's feared by everyone in Great Liang.

60
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,380
He is highly skilled in martial arts
and stays single and celibate.

61
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,240
He's only 28 years old,

62
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,510
yet he's already the Grand Mentor

63
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,140
and wields great power in the court.

64
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,920
He is ruthless.

65
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,080
His new ideas of torturing criminals emerge endlessly.

66
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,580
In a word, everyone in Great Liang looks pale
when they hear Duke Chu's name.

67
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,440
I don't want to die.

68
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,000
Let me out!

69
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,670
Let me out!

70
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,640
Let me out!

71
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,030
Let me out…

72
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,550
If you don't let me out any longer…

73
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,070
you can at least give me something to eat.

74
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,650
Go.

75
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,230
Where?

76
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,730
Send you on your way.

77
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,800
Get in!

78
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,960
I'll confess. I'll confess all.

79
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,290
Please don't kill me!

80
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,190
My name is Mo An'an. I'm 25 years old.

81
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,410
I was born in Guangdong.

82
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,270
I live in Sanlitun, Beijing, now.

83
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,980
I'm just a harmless food blogger.

84
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't know how I end up here.

85
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,730
Officer, I want to go home.

86
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,180
Mo An'an.

87
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,610
Come here.

88
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,580
How could there be a hot pot in ancient times?

89
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,330
Did he also travel through time?

90
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,350
Odd numbers reverse; even numbers remain the same.

91
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,230
This question is indeed a little difficult.

92
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,430
Liquor in the palace.

93
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,080
You don't even watch the sketches.

94
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,280
When fellow townsmen meet each other…

95
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,240
Do you want to die?

96
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,950
You should've said, "Tears start to well in their eyes."

97
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,490
Eat.

98
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,660
Sugar for you.

99
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,990
Thank you.

100
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,040
How did you know I would need sugar?

101
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,150
This is my secret recipe

102
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,830
as a food blogger.

103
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,230
Add a little sugar to the dipping sauce.

104
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,490
-It will make the food taste fresh and good.
-It will make the food taste fresh and good.

105
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,560
You can't have a hot pot or barbecue without it.

106
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,720
How do you know that?

107
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,330
Your habits haven't changed after so many years.

108
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,450
So, are you going to keep

109
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,750
pretending not to know me?
