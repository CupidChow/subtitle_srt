[Lovesickness]

00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,910
[Episode 8]

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,910
Your Grace, are you alright?

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,130
-You may leave.
-Yes.

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,870
Your Grace.

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,170
Duke Chu, I have a question.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,870
Please go ahead, Your Grace.

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,870
Since Sister An is back,

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,390
haven't you thought about resuming your relationship?

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,290
Since she left cold-heartedly seven years ago,

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,690
it became absolutely impossible
for us to be together again.

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,950
Didn't she tell you

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,400
what happened seven years ago?

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,950
She's always played dumb
since she came back this time.

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,590
She seems to have forgotten everything in the past.

17
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,230
Did she lose her memory?

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,150
Maybe she is really not

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,350
the same person as Sister An.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,550
So, is this the reason why Your Grace

21
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,680
sent someone to assassinate her in my mansion?

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,130
I don't understand

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,330
what you're talking about, Duke Chu.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,220
I'll return this token to its rightful owner.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,190
It's too dangerous to stay beside this fricking pervert.

26
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,560
Even the Empress Dowager wants to kill me.

27
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,060
I hope Your Grace can spare her

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,020
for the sake of the old sisterhood.

29
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,540
Xiao Chu.

30
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,170
You're still protecting her, even now.

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,300
It's been seven years.

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,590
You are so affectionate.

33
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,670
Do you know that someone also…

34
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,329
Your Grace.

35
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,310
I only put the country first now.

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,340
I've long set aside my own romantic affair.

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,370
They do have an affair.

38
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,110
They even both treat me as a substitute.

39
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,510
Are you still in a fight?

40
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,880
Don't talk when eating.

41
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,430
The storybook says men should be tolerant

42
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,360
because only women and villains are hard to deal with.

43
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,590
Have you finished copying "Thesis on National Strategies“?

44
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,850
Why did you have time to read storybooks?

45
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,040
Open your mouth.

46
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,870
I thought Prince Ning would be too distinguished to work.

47
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,210
I didn't expect you to know how to do this.

48
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,530
I wasn't born

49
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,280
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,360
I was born in the cold palace.

51
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,980
The late Emperor did not favor my mother.

52
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,150
The servants around us

53
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,000
knew how to treat people differently
according to their social status.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,900
It was a common thing
that they embezzled our allowances.

55
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,100
Duke Chu is unlike me.

56
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,890
He has been loved by all ever since he was young.

57
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,070
It's all in the past.

58
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,290
Fortunately, Your Highness, all your sufferings have their reward now.

59
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,990
Yes, all my sufferings have their reward.

60
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,980
From now on,

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,390
no one dares to disobey me.

62
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,990
What?

63
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,830
Nothing.

64
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,890
Miss Mo, the meat is ready.

65
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,950
Please.

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,180
The meat looks good.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,450
Thank you, Prince Ning.

68
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,070
You're welcome, Duke Chu.

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,210
I see that you're not young anymore.

70
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,270
Have you never thought about

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,670
adding a hostess

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,330
to your big mansion?

73
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,270
Prince Ning, since when did you

74
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,850
start to care whether my mansion

75
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,050
has a hostess or not?

76
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,550
I just thought of myself.

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,780
Even in the whole capital,

78
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,900
it's hard to find someone like Miss Mo.

79
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,930
She's lively and cute.

80
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,270
And she knows how to manage a house, too.

81
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,280
Her?

82
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,460
Prince Ning, what good taste you have!

83
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,230
Bye.

84
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,030
If you keep waving, your arm will break.

85
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,870
If you are so reluctant to part with him,

86
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,250
why don't you go to Prince Ning's Mansion to be a maid?

87
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,240
What do you mean?

88
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,830
I just think

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,060
Prince Ning was quite pitiful when he was young.

90
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,950
Pitiful?

91
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,670
Do you know

92
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,740
how I've gotten through all these years?

93
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,250
How can I know if you don't tell me?

94
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,090
That's because you don't care at all.

95
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,890
If you did, you wouldn't have...

96
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,550
Where are you going so early in the morning?

97
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,940
None of your business.

98
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,370
The last person who talked to me like that

99
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,390
has been reincarnated eight times.

100
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,590
Your Highness, the respected Duke Chu,

101
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,830
I just want to go shopping

102
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,870
and buy some candied haws.

103
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,240
You're not allowed.

104
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,720
You per…

105
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,160
Perhaps the sun is indeed a bit blazing.

106
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,800
One shouldn't go out today.

107
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,990
Strange.

108
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,320
Why is there no guard today?

109
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,740
Whatever. I'll leave first.

110
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,070
One, two, three.

111
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,350
Hello, Miss Mo.

112
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,420
You...

113
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,270
Miss Mo.

114
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,470
His Lordship knows you like candied haws,

115
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,920
so he bought all of them

116
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,770
in this street.

117
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,630
Just eat as much as you want.

118
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,340
That is not necessary.

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,680
His Lordship said

120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,570
you must finish them today.

121
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,230
Go!

122
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,550
Miss Mo, look.

123
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,770
Miss Mo!

124
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,810
Miss Mo!

125
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,290
Look at my candied haws.

126
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,020
There are no others like these.

127
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,720
Help!

128
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,600
Xiao Chu, you fricking pervert!

129
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,760
So vicious!

130
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,250
You forced me to eat so many candied haws.

131
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,880
My teeth would fall off.

132
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,570
Come down.

133
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,679
No.

134
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,559
Don't think that I'm unaware of the fact

135
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,490
that you just wanted to make me eat.

136
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,590
I'd rather die than eat them.

137
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,770
Mo An'an, behind you, there's a...

138
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,420
snake!

139
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,670
There are no snakes.

140
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,020
Xiao Chu, you liar!

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,690
This is illegal imprisonment.

142
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,820
I'll report it to the police… I mean, the local official.

143
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,330
Go ahead.

144
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,190
I'd like to see

145
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,150
who dares to arrest me in the whole Great Liang.

146
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,370
I saw that you'd been quite obedient lately.

147
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,590
I wanted to show some mercy and give you the antidote.

148
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,910
It seems that I was imagining it.

149
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,750
Xiao Chu, you evil ego-manic!

150
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,030
All you know is threaten me with the antidote.

151
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,260
Let me tell you. I'd rather die than be a substitute.
