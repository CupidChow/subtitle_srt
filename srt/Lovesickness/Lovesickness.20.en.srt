00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,960
Xiao Chu,

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,960
forgive me for not even having the courage

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,820
to say goodbye to you face to face.

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,560
Prince Ning?

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,320
Why did Prince Ning suddenly come back to the capital?

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,800
I heard that His Majesty is seriously ill.

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
He's worried Prince Ning has evil intentions.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,530
So he summoned him back to the capital.

10
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,880
Since my plan for Zhao Yuchan doesn't work,

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,280
I can just get rid of Prince Ning.

12
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,120
Why is the wall so high?

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,410
There's not even a dog hole.

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,620
Darn it. I'm always the one asked to run errands.

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,680
Even God is on my side.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,680
Yes!

17
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,160
Brother Xiao Chu, what are you doing?

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Yuchan, you are here.

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Come here.

20
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,200
Enjoy their new song with me.

21
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,820
Where is Sister An?

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
How would I know?

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
She has legs.

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,870
She can leave or stay as she wants.

25
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I have no right to mind her business.

26
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,770
I don't want to mind her business either.

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,720
Listen carefully.

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,290
Not everyone

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
can come here.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Madam, is this Prince Ning's inner courtyard?

31
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,600
You look stupid,

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
but you're quite observant.

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,079
It was wise of me

34
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,570
to pick you from the maids.

35
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm the chosen one.

36
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Madam.

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
I will work hard.

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,240
Thank you for the trouble you've taken on my behalf.

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
Not at all.

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,760
I just think you're ugly and honest.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,640
You're not like those lowly maids

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,730
who just want to get dressed up to seduce Prince Ning.

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,160
Thank you.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,079
All right, go clean the yard now.

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,200
Why is no one else here?

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,610
How dare you!

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,520
Who allowed you to touch Prince Ning's favorite orchids?

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,380
Forgive me, Prince Ning. I'm leaving immediately.

50
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
I finally met him.

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
I can't just leave like this.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
With all due respect,

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,090
the orchids' roots have rotted

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,450
due to excessive water.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
You should pour less water these days.

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,040
You know how to raise orchids?

57
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,800
My father is an expert in raising orchids.

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,330
I've learned some from him since I was little.

59
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,970
I'm in charge of watering the orchids.

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,800
The amount of water is the same as before.

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,680
How could there be excessive water?

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,640
The capital's environment is a bit moist during rainy days.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,040
You shouldn't pour too much water. You should adjust the amount of water according to the environment.

64
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,720
You...

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
All right, you may leave.

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,440
Yes.

67
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
What's your name?

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
My name is Xiao'an.

69
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
Xiao'an?

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,080
From now on, you stay in my inner courtyard

71
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,210
to take care of the orchids.

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
Yes.

73
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,720
Come with me to Treasure Pavilion today.

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,440
It's said that there is a pot of orchids from the State of Nan.

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,120
Yes.

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
Why do you keep staring at me?

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,760
Sorry.

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
It's just...

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,090
It's just that I have never seen anyone

80
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,920
as handsome as you.

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Xiao Chu is much more handsome than you.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,440
Darn it! Who is it?

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,280
Go take a look.

84
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,200
Whose carriage is this?

85
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
Calm down.

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,250
Considering how I look now,

87
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,220
I don't think he can recognize me.

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,400
Sir,

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,840
can you move your carriage backward a bit?

90
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,440
Who is in your carriage?

91
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,680
Why should I move it backward?

92
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,200
Xiao'an, come back.

93
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,120
Yes.

94
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,960
So it's Prince Ning. Long time no see.

95
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,200
I returned to the capital not long ago.

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,660
I'll invite you to my mansion some other day.

97
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
I happen to be free today.

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,730
Why don't we... catch up on each other?

99
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,570
Prince Ning is going to Treasure Pavilion today.

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,360
Your Highness, please do it some other day.

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,690
Then let's go together.

102
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,240
Prince Ning, do you mind?

103
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,320
Of course not.

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,080
Xiao Chu, please.

105
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
Prince Ning, please.

106
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,480
What a troublemaker!
