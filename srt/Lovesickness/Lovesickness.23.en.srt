1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,640
I failed to kill Prince Ning, and now I've been poisoned.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,800
Why did I act tough?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,700
Look at myself now.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,050
I only have seven days left to live.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,640
An Mo.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,530
What did Yuchan say?

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,560
She has decided to enter the palace.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,180
Aren't you surprised?

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,900
Why should I be surprised?

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,600
Officials' daughters

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,900
can't decide their marriage.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,039
You're right.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,060
It seems no matter how hard we try,

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,280
we can't evade our fate.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,480
I don't believe in fate.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,360
Even if His Majesty bestows a marriage on me in the future,

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,880
I won't marry anyone,

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,000
except you.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,840
Xiao Chu,

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,600
I will cherish

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
my last days with you.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
An Mo, you...

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,170
What are you doing so early in the morning?

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,480
Wait.

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,240
Although I will definitely marry you,

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,840
now you're still unmarried.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,780
What are you thinking?

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,200
Look.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,329
This is couples' wish list.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
There are ten things that couples should do together.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,079
Taking a photo together.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
What does it mean?

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,140
How much longer is it going to take? My arm is going to break.

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,980
Hold on a little longer. I think he can finish drawing soon.

36
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,800
Done?

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,940
It's my turn to draw eyebrows for you.

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,880
Beautiful.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Don't.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,680
You...

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,320
Let me draw eyebrows for you.

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,580
Let me refine them.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Stop running.

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's go. Let's go buy candied haws, okay?

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,960
Okay.

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,440
Slow down.

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
No.

48
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Sit.

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
Xiao Chu.

50
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,440
If I suddenly disappear one day,

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
what would you do?

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,460
I'll wait for you forever.

53
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
You've been acting strange lately.

54
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
Like a kid.

55
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,120
What? You don't like it?

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,280
I like it.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I like it no matter what you're like.

58
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
If I die,

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
no one

60
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,120
will hurt you because of me.

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
What's next?

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
One last thing.

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,700
Release sky lanterns.

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
Your Highness, the empress gave birth to a boy.

65
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,480
His Majesty summoned you to the palace.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Got it.

67
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,850
The little emperor?

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,840
Xiao Chu.

69
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,620
I'm going to the palace first.

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,810
I'll release sky lanterns with you when I'm back.

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,840
Xiao Chu.

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,120
It's getting cold. Keep warm.

73
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,410
Wait for me to come back.

74
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,240
I can't recover from my old illness. I'm afraid I don't have much time left.

75
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Your Majesty.

76
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,659
Let me finish my words.

77
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,560
I know my health very well.

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,400
Many people in the court want Prince Ning

79
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,760
to ascend the throne after I die.

80
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,400
Now that I have a son,

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,370
I'm afraid this has ruined their plan.

82
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
Xiao Chu.

83
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,160
You should shoulder the responsibility

85
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,840
of Duke's Mansion, just like your father.

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,520
Tomorrow, I will issue an edict

87
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,840
that you will inherit the duke's title and help my son with court affairs.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,600
In this way, even if I die,

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,000
you can help me protect my son

90
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
and stabilize the country.

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,560
But I'm not good at politics.

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

93
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,680
I know you don't want to get involved in the court.

94
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,400
You have pretended to be a playboy.

95
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,600
But now, among the people around me,

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,400
you're the only person I can trust except the prime minister.

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,400
I will do my best to protect your son,

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
even if I have to risk my life.

99
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,760
Xiao Chu, looks like I can't wait till you come back.

100
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,320
An Mo.

101
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,120
Xiao Chu,

102
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,640
I left.

103
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Forget me.

104
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,760
Officer,

105
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,410
I really am not lying to you.

106
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,880
She just disappeared in the blink of an eye.

107
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
On the rooftop.

108
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,640
She... She came back in the blink of an eye.

109
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
An'an. An'an.

110
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,400
An'an, are you... are you a human or a ghost?

111
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,760
An'an, you're not dead.

112
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,680
Great.

113
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,760
Xiaomei, how long was I gone?

114
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,920
You were gone for... about seven or eight minutes.

115
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,000
Come on.

116
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,880
An'an, what's going on?

117
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,440
Is... something wrong with me?

118
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,000
I hallucinated?

119
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,970
Lend me your cellphone.

120
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,200
Why?

121
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,560
Why can't I change anything?

122
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
Why?

123
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,210
Where's the thumb ring?

124
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,530
Where's the thumb ring?

125
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,440
What?

126
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,440
Thumb...

127
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,640
Is this it?

128
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,860
Just now, you were reciting a poem

129
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,340
and then you disappeared.

130
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,210
This was the only thing left on the ground.

131
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,960
This is it.

132
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
I don't believe it. If I can't save you in my first attempt, I'll try again.

133
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
If I still can't, I'll try again and again.

134
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
I don't believe I can't save you.

135
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
How... How did I get there just now?

136
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,320
The poem.

137
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,080
Reciting the poem.

138
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,440
An'an, where are you going again?

139
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
People all say love is bitter.

140
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,400
Even so, I still don't regret it.

141
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,480
Mo An'an!
