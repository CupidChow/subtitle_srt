1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,040
This is a top-quality Hotan jade.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,680
This gold-inlaid jade signifies

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,010
peace, wealth, and an auspicious and harmonious marriage.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
It can be given to the girl you like as a gift.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,640
The girl you like?

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,360
Xiao'an, what do you think of it?

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Your Highness, you asked the wrong person.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,040
How would I know about these things?

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
Your Highness, do you have a girl you like?

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,880
Yes. Of course.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,240
Yu from the Shangchun Brothel,

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,760
Jiao from the Yuehua Pavilion,

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,360
and Li from the Tingyu Pavilion.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,120
All of them are girls I like.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,500
Your Highness, you're really good at making jokes.

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,600
This vase looks like a gourd,

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
symbolizing blessings and wealth.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,760
The glaze on it is bright and translucent,

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,160
signifying peace, wealth, and auspiciousness.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,160
This colorful vase is not bad,

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
and its symbolism is good as well.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,380
I can give it to Imperial Brother for a good omen.

24
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,160
It's fine that this maid of yours is ugly.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,600
But how come she has no sense at all?

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
Xiao'an, serve tea to His Highness.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,080
This treasure is a precious find

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
from the Western Region.

29
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,560
It is a jade thumb ring

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,440
meticulously crafted by a master artisan.

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,039
A jade thumb ring?

32
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,039
It is even better.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,920
Xiao'an?

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
It's okay.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,759
You...

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm out of tea. I'll go and get another pot.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
Your Highness, you seem to

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,490
care about this maid of mine very much.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,320
Do I?

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,510
It's just that I haven't seen

42
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,310
such a clumsy maid in a long time.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,980
I need to use the restroom.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Why is the jade thumb ring here?

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,220
The jade thumb ring...

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Is what should happen going to eventually happen?

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,880
Xiao Chu, Xiao Chu.

48
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,360
What should I do?

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
What should I do?

50
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,340
I must not let the history repeat itself.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
This luminous pearl is worth a fortune.

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,079
It's from the East Sea.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,180
It can be used at night to make the house as bright as during the day.

54
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,720
This painting of Autumn Breeze is a genuine work of Master Yan.

55
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,240
I traveled thousands of miles for this painting,

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
rushing from the capital

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,880
to Yongzhou to buy it

58
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,880
before Yongzhou's richest man.

59
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,140
As everyone knows,

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,320
this painting is one of Master Yan's earliest works.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,180
Your Highness, have you seen anything you like?

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
These are just some ordinary treasures,

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
nothing interesting.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,800
Indeed.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,820
Every year,

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,510
Imperial Brother bestows countless rare treasures

67
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,360
upon you.

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Of course, such common items

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
can't catch your eye.

70
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,160
I spent a lot of effort

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
to get it.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,460
Everyone, take a closer look.

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,160
Take a closer look.

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
This is an invaluable treasure.

75
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Xiao'an. Serve tea to me.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,680
Xiao'an? What are you waiting for?

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,140
Serve tea to His Highness.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,840
You can't drink it.

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,520
I can't drink it?

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Hurry up.

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,290
Are you trying to make me die of thirst?

82
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,160
Xiao Chu.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,660
This tea tastes unfresh. I'll go find the owner.

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Xiao Chu!

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Xiao Chu, are you okay?

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,690
I'll go get a doctor.

87
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,520
Are you admitting that you know me now?

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,860
I've already told you it's poisoned.

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
Why did you insist on drinking it?

90
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,440
Do you know

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,000
that murdering Prince Ning is a capital crime?

92
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,810
How could I bear to watch you

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,840
seeking your own death?

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,280
My life doesn't matter.

95
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,110
I just want you to live well.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
Since you're willing to die for me,

97
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,000
why did you heartlessly leave me?

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,280
What kind of feelings do you have for me after all?

99
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
Xiao Chu.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Xiao Chu, don't die!

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Xiao Chu, I like you.

102
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,880
I want to be with you forever.

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,110
I will never leave you again, Xiao Chu.

104
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,690
You finally admitted that you like me.

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
You...

106
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,170
are still alive.

107
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,740
Could these little tricks of yours really stump me?

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,280
You liar!

109
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,140
If I hadn't lied to you,

110
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,690
how could I know your feelings towards me?

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Since you like it so much,

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,560
let's consider it as our token of love.

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,840
It seems what's meant to happen has happened.

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,680
Is this all God's will?

115
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,000
Your Highness, I've heard of your elegance and charm

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,330
since I was at my fiefdom in the southwest.

117
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,940
Today, upon seeing you, it's indeed not unfounded praise.

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,290
Prince Ning,

119
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
I'll take this maid.

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
Consider it a favor I owe to you.

121
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
She's just a maid.

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,000
Your Highness, if you like her, just take her with you.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,720
Thank you.

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,320
Prince Ning is harboring treasonous intentions?

125
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
How is that possible?

126
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,570
Did you try to kill him because of this?

127
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
He definitely has treasonous intentions.

128
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,440
Otherwise, why would His Majesty be in such a hurry

129
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,300
to summon him back to the capital?

130
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,940
Anyway, remember,

131
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,730
you must be cautious of him.

132
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
And you.

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,100
Don't do such silly things again.

134
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,040
Today, if it weren't for me,

135
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,410
you would be in big trouble.

136
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,240
I see.

137
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,800
Brother Xiao Chu,

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,460
I heard that Sister An is back.

139
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,640
It's just because I heard that Sister An is back

140
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,360
that I came to see her.

141
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,680
I didn't expect that Sister An is the girl

142
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,130
Brother Xiao Chu likes.

143
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,620
Congratulations, Brother Xiao Chu.

144
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,680
Congratulations, Sister An.

145
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,240
I'll leave you alone for now.

146
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,360
Yuchan!

147
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Don't chase her.
