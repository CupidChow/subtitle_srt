00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,880
Why did my butt always land first every time?

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,360
Oh no, Xiao Chu.

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Xiao Chu.

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Xiao Chu.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
Who are you?

7
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,080
Did... His Majesty ask you here to save me?

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,760
Who are you?

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
I am Xiao Chu.

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,400
How could it be? You...

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,680
Bro, how old are you?

12
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,800
I... I'm seven years old.

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
28 years old.

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,240
21 years old.

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,490
Seven years old.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,220
How could this happen?

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Hurry. Come with me. Someone wants to kill you.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Hurry. Squat inside.

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,280
Stay here and don't move.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,600
No matter what happens outside,

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,660
don't make a sound.

22
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,890
Where are you going?

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm going to distract them.

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,400
Will you die?

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,160
No, I'm Miss Fairy.

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Miss Fairy,

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,000
where should I find you after you leave?

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,960
Don't look for me. Do you hear me?

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,240
I told you I'm a fairy.

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,740
You can't see me again.

31
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,400
Remember,

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
in the future, if you meet someone

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,980
who looks exactly like me,

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,050
you must stay away from her.

35
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
She will only get you killed.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,170
Cover your ears and keep quiet.

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,920
Run, Your Highness! Go to the back door!

38
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,480
Someone will pick you up.

39
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,200
An'an.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
It hurts a lot.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,640
Are you done?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,720
You were gone for over ten seconds this time. Is it necessary to disappear?

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,850
The cellphone. Give me the cellphone.

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,160
You want to read the unofficial history about Duke Chu again?

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
What's the content of the last part?

46
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,600
Prince Ning started a rebellion.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,120
Duke Chu killed Prince Ning on his own.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,920
He also died due to Prince Ning's conspiracy.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,960
That's all. Nothing more.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,800
Why? Why is it still the same?

51
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,050
Why was he still killed by Prince Ning?

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,820
People all say love is bitter.

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,720
Even so, I still don't regret it.

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
Why is it you?

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,000
I... If not me...

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,080
If not me, who else could it be?

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,900
People all say love is bitter.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,880
Even so, I still don't regret it.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Why can't I go back?

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,520
Why can't I go back?

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,110
An'an, don't scare me, okay?

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,760
Why can't I go back?

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
Impossible.

64
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,720
An'an,

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,600
let's go to the hospital.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,840
Let's go to the hospital.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
I have to go back.

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
I have to go back.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,860
Where do you want to go, An'an?

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,159
Calm down, okay?

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,720
Xiao Chu, I can't save you.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,120
I can't save you.

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Xiao Chu.

74
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Xiao Chu.

75
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,520
An'an.

76
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,880
An'an.

77
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Thank you.

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,720
Go save him. He's waiting for you.

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Save him?

80
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,640
Save whom?

81
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,040
Who are you?

82
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,760
I wrote that letter to you.

83
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,600
Xiao Chu.

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
Xiao Chu.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,240
An'an, you're awake.

86
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,240
It was Xiao Chu.

87
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,640
He's not dead.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Unofficial history is indeed a lie.

89
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,400
Your fever is finally gone.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Yesterday, you had a fever and your body temperature reached 39℃.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,200
Xiaomei, he's not dead. He's not dead.

92
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
He came to me.

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,440
He must be the one who saved me in the car accident back then.

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
An'an,

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,200
is something wrong with your brain because of the fever?

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,560
Who saved whom?

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
The letter. The letter.

98
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,760
This letter is for you

99
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,760
and for myself.

100
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,570
Maybe you can't see this letter

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,160
for the rest of your life.

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
If you see this letter in the future,

103
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,770
I hope you won't realize it's written for you.

104
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
I hope you won't immerse in the memories of us

105
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,800
because we've been separated.

106
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,000
I thought it was a coincidence that I met you in Shangchun Brothel.

107
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,120
I didn't know it was fate.

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,920
Saving me in the darkness when I was seven was the cause.

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,600
So I thought

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,600
achieving my ambition after being rescued from the desperate situation was the result.

111
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,530
Crying for me at Treasure Pavilion

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,120
when I was 21 years old was the cause.

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,560
So I thought

114
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,480
being with the one I love was the result.

115
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,560
Seven years later, I was 28 years old.

116
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Our reunion was the cause.

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,920
So I thought

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,360
holding your hands to grow old together was the result.

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,370
What I didn't know is to you,

120
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,919
meeting the 28-year-old me was the cause

121
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,320
and losing me was the result.

122
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,419
Meeting the 21-year-old me was the cause

123
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,090
and getting killed by Zhao Yuchan was the result.

124
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
Saving the seven-year-old me was the cause

125
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,980
and never seeing me again was the result.

126
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,540
After I got separated from you, it took me many years

127
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
to realize that I exist in your past,

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,920
but you are running towards my future.

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
Since you left,

130
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,120
I've spent my whole life searching for causes and results.

131
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,400
But I can never see you again.

132
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
But I'm still willing

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,490
to wait for you forever.

134
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,840
People all say love is bitter.

135
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,800
Even so, I still don't regret it.
