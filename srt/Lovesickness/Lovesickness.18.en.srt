1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,380
Are you willing to marry Xiao Chu?

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Sister An, why are you asking this?

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,470
I can tell that you like Xiao Chu.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,420
No, Sister An, don't misunderstand.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,280
Brother Xiao Chu and I...

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,080
I can help you.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,780
I can help you pursue Xiao Chu.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,240
Why do you want to help me?

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,410
You and Brother Xiao Chu...

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,320
We just share the same tastes.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,490
We're just friends.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,880
Besides, I don't like Xiao Chu.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,160
But I think Brother Xiao Chu

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,240
treats you differently.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,450
It's impossible for us to be together.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,360
I already have someone I like.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,840
But it's inappropriate for a woman to pursue a man.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
So what? Men and women are equal.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,600
Listen,

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,960
a woman can take the initiative

22
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,840
to fight for anything she wants,

23
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,640
including the man she likes.

24
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,880
Men and women are equal?

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,800
This is the first time that I heard something like this.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,730
Yes, men and women should be equal.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,000
Who says women are inferior to men?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,360
Women can be capable.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,520
Women can join the army and fight a war.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,240
Women can also be an emperor.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,880
I've never heard of a woman being an emperor.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,440
Although we are women,

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,700
we can still control our own fate.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,240
Are you willing to let others

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,920
control your fate?

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,640
Sister An, what do you think I should do?

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
Tonight is Xiao Chu's birthday.

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Is it ready? I'm starving.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,600
Yes.

40
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,520
Wait. No hurry.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Someone is not here yet.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,560
Who?

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,720
Sorry, I'm late.

44
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,040
Yuchan.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,079
Today is Brother Xiao Chu's birthday.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,000
I wish Brother Xiao Chu

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
great vitality and a promising future.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,360
May all your wishes come true and may you be safe and happy.

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,420
Thank you, Yuchan.

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,579
Yuchan, you are so clever and nimble.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,360
Someone is really lucky.

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,720
Sister An, I prepared one for you too.

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
Really?

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,640
Sister An, we are sworn sisters.

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,320
So I'm using a sachet embroidered with lily flowers

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,040
as a gift.

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Thanks.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,960
I also prepared super delicious hot pot.

59
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,360
Consider it my gift for you.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,280
Hot pot?

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,320
Sit.

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,480
This is called hot pot?

63
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,410
It's called hot pot because the pot is placed above the fire.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,120
You can't eat it directly. You need dipping sauce.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
The dipping sauce made by me is amazing.

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,160
It is fresh and tasty.

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,660
It's necessary for hot pot and barbecue.

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,400
The soul is this spoon of sugar.

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,280
Interesting.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,910
Come on, Yuchan.

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
How does it taste?

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,280
Not bad.

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,770
It's really delicious.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,520
Hot pot is my favorite.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,640
Eat.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,240
There are so many dishes.

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,840
Yes.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Is there wax gourd there?

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,480
Thank you.

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I can do it myself.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
Cheers.

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
Here comes the osmanthus cake.

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
Happy birthday.

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
So beautiful.

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,240
Come on. Put your palms together.

86
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
Not like this. Like this.

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,450
Close your eyes.

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
Make a wish.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,520
I...

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,730
You can't say it out.

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
Blow out the candles at one stroke,

92
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
and your wish will come true.

93
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Let's do it together.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,400
Okay.

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,040
One, two, three.

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,020
Sister An, you know a lot of interesting things.

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,620
You eat first. I have something to do.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
I'll be right back.

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,980
I'm taking the sachet with me.

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,720
If...

101
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,360
If it weren't for me,

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,900
you two would be meant to be together, right?

103
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,560
Brother Xiao Chu.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Brother Xiao Chu.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
What's wrong?

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Do you still remember

107
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,400
when we first met in the imperial palace?

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
Of course.

109
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
When I was recuperating in the palace,

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,100
you often came to accompany me

111
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,960
and tell me interesting things.

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Actually,

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
when I first met you,

114
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,360
I fell in love with you.

115
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,120
I wonder how you think of me.

116
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
You are very nice.

117
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,280
You are the most talented

118
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,410
and virtuous woman I've ever seen.

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,800
Really?

120
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
Brother Xiao Chu, are you willing to marry...

121
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,490
What's wrong with An Mo?

122
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,640
Yuchan, I'm going to take a look.

123
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Brother Xiao Chu.

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,120
Brother Xiao Chu.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,640
Well, you're drinking here secretly.

126
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,760
Why are you crying?

127
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,720
You're here.

128
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
You're here.

129
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,840
You... are drunk.

130
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,240
Xiao Chu.

131
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Xiao Chu.

132
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,560
Xiao Chu.

133
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,760
How much... did I drink?

134
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
My head hurts a lot.

135
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,280
What happened last night?

136
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,800
Gosh! I kissed Xiao Chu forcibly.

137
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,680
Oh no.

138
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,160
Mo An'an, how could you do that?

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,300
You said you'd be their matchmaker, but you want to take him away from her.

140
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
You can't do this.

141
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,950
You can't do this.
