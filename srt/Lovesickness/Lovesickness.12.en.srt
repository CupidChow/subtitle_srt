00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,860
[Episode 12]

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,700
According to His Majesty's edict,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,660
Prince Ning, Zhangsun He,

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,040
cultivated private soldiers

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,480
and attempted to start a rebellion.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,410
Thus, he has been

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,730
deprived of his title

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,270
and his family property has been confiscated.

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,260
He shall be beheaded in public in three days.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,190
Are you here to laugh at me?

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,250
I'm here to offer you a way out.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,030
I'll help you ascend the throne.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,980
You help me kill Mo An'an.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,680
This really is a good trick.

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,670
In this way,

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,340
you can be with Xiao Chu.

19
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,220
I wonder why the empress dowager summoned you to the palace.

20
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,640
She knows you and His Lordship just got married.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,120
His Lordship said

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,470
it's not safe for you to go out lately

23
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,870
due to the unrest.

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,170
Looks like today,

25
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,380
maybe I'll have to put an end to it with her.

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,830
Miss Mo,

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,400
getting married in Great Liang

28
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,590
requires parents' approval and matchmakers' words.

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,620
So you and Duke Chu can't be counted as a couple.

30
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,470
Your Grace, just say what you want to say.

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,360
Then I'm going to make it clear.

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,370
I will never let you be with Xiao Chu.

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,450
Your appearance will only harm him again.

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,150
You don't know Xiao Chu at all.

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,470
Even without me,

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,100
Xiao Chu still wouldn't fall in love with you.

37
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,910
I won't let go of the person I love.

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,790
Very good.

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,940
I managed to kill you seven years ago.

40
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,190
I can kill you again today.

41
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,970
You put drug in the tea!

42
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,940
General Fan, Prince Ning has already lost.

43
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,210
Surrender now.

44
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,290
Drop the sword. Kneel!

45
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,590
Okay.

46
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,910
Kneel!

47
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,340
Report!

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,360
Your Lordship, Prince Ning escaped from the prison

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,620
and kidnapped Miss Mo.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,130
Prince Ning, what are you waiting for?

51
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,900
Calm down, Your Grace.

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,940
She's still useful.

53
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,160
I think

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,870
it's because you still like this bitch.

55
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,270
If I don't keep her alive,

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,820
how can I lure Xiao Chu into the palace

57
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,030
and carry out my plan to kill him on his way?

58
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,090
Kill him on his way?

59
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,710
You set a trap

60
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,910
on Xiao Chu's way back to the palace?

61
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,410
I've set a trap.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,520
I want him dead.

63
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,950
You promised me not to kill Xiao Chu.

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,830
Between Xiao Chu and I...

65
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,350
Madam.

66
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,320
Either he dies

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
or I die.

68
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,990
Where is she?

69
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Haitang.

70
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,530
Let's go.

71
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,680
Madam, leave!

72
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,430
No, let's leave together.

73
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,450
Don't worry about me. Just leave!

74
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,330
Haitang.

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,230
Madam, leave!

76
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,310
You're asking for death.

77
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,100
Haitang.

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,490
No!

79
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,050
Stop! Who is trying to break into the imperial palace?

80
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,150
Open your eyes and look carefully.

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,770
Duke Chu.

82
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,600
Release.

83
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,260
Be careful, Your Lordship.

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Hu Qi.

85
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,210
Your Lordship.

86
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,360
Hu Qi!

87
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,450
Release!

88
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,370
Kill!

89
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,040
Kill!

90
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,920
Xiao Chu.

91
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,430
Xiao Chu!

92
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Mo An'an,

93
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,430
you're going to die today.

94
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,540
Kill!

95
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,260
An'an!

96
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,020
Since I can't have you,

97
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,549
Brother Xiao Chu,

98
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,919
goodbye.

99
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,370
Release!

100
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,630
Xiao Chu.

101
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,010
Xiao Chu!

102
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,600
Xiao Chu.

103
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,590
An'an.

104
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,370
Xiao Chu.

105
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,310
An'an.

106
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,980
An'an.

107
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,300
Take me back.

108
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,950
Please take me back.

109
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,640
Take me back.

110
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,820
Take me back.
