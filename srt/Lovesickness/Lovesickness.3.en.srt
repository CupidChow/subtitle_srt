00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,190
Give it to me! Give it to me!

[Episode 3]

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,190
Not only did you steal,

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
but also dared to escape when given the chance.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,010
Fine, I'll give you a chance.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,940
Don't be impulsive.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,340
Let me explain.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,100
Hu Qi!

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,810
Your Lordship.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,890
Put your hand down.

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,230
The maid Mo An'an sneaked into the master's room late at night

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,600
and attempted wrongdoing.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,750
Send her to jail immediately.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,720
-What?
-What?

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,330
What are you waiting for? Take her away.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,950
Yes!

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,030
I... I...

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,720
I...

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,380
Xiao Chu, you pervert!

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,230
Are you going to imprison me again?

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,330
Xiao Chu!

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,039
I, Mo An'an,

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,530
would rather starve to death than eat a single grain of rice from Duke's Mansion.

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,510
Am I going to be starved to death?

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,590
If I can have a barbecue,

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,979
then let it be.

29
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,870
Then after you die,

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,500
I'll burn some for you.

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,910
I dare not bother you, Duke Chu.

32
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,830
I can come out and eat now.

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,990
Come and serve me while I'm eating.

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,080
If you serve me well,

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,360
I might consider rewarding you with a few bites.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,510
Okay, I'll do it right away.

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,230
How come I heard someone saying

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,300
she would never eat a single grain of rice from Duke's Mansion?

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,900
Can rice be compared to meat?

40
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,150
You're getting more and more cheeky.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,170
After all, I'm now a member of Duke's Mansion.

42
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,730
I have to look up to you.

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,350
Are you trying to mock me?

44
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,140
I've never lost an argument.

45
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,800
[Duke's Mansion]

46
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,830
Duke, is there anything else?

47
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,440
If there's not, I'll go back and lie down.

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,380
Duke Chu, I'm really going back.

49
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,390
Why isn't he stopping me?

50
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,310
Hurry. Stop me.

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,930
Is he really going to send me back to jail?

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,820
I'm really going back.

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,780
Your Lordship!

54
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,130
Your Lordship, continue.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
I'll come back later.

56
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,680
Say it.

57
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,160
You just left like that?

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,860
Duke Chu?

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,150
It can be considered as escaping.

60
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,159
A comet and the Emperor Star Ziwei. It means really bad luck!

61
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,480
Really bad luck!

62
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,800
I can go back.

63
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,350
I can't go back.

64
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,250
I can go back.

65
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,830
I can't go back.

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,530
I can...

67
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,820
I can't go back.

68
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,670
Hurry up. His Majesty has arrived.

69
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,200
Let's go.

70
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,830
Yes.

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
Gosh. Where are they?

72
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,920
How could I actually lose them?

73
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,350
You have quite the nerve as a maid,

74
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,480
daring to slack off in Duke's Mansion.

75
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,560
Do I really look like a maid?

76
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,240
Call me Miss Fairy.

77
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,250
How dare you! I'll arrest you!

78
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,790
No wonder it's Duke's Mansion.

79
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,120
Even a little brat dares to arrest people.

80
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Do you know where the Emperor is?

81
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,500
What do you want with the Emperor?

82
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,590
I want to report to His Majesty.

83
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,070
Xiao Chu, this pervert.

84
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,190
He enslaves people,

85
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,550
imprisons virtuous women,

86
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,320
disregards the law, and dominates everything with an iron fist.

87
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,580
He's cruel and ruthless, extremely vicious,

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,840
cold-blooded, and has a heart of a beast.

89
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,550
Duke Chu, is she referring to you?

90
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,060
Possibly.

91
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,320
I failed in disciplining my servants properly.

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,180
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

93
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,610
It's getting late.

94
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,170
Let me escort you back to the palace.

95
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,100
I finally got a chance to sneak out.

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,160
You should go back early.

97
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't make the Empress Dowager worry.

98
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,770
I find her quite amusing.

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,520
So I'll bring her along with me.

100
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,800
This little brat is the Emperor?

101
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,640
My plan to report to His Majesty failed.

102
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm about to be rich.

103
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,830
If I can take one of these back,

104
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,040
it will be enough for me to eat hot pot for a lifetime.

105
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,470
In response to the Southern flood disaster,

106
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,600
Your Majesty, what are your insights?

107
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,400
I believe that we should allocate the funds first to provide disaster relief,

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,780
arranging shelter for the affected people

109
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,610
to prevent them from becoming refugees.

110
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,980
Continue.

111
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,790
Secondly, we should distribute grain from the granaries

112
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,060
to ensure the food supply for the disaster victims,

113
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,310
thereby stabilizing the people's faith in the Court.

114
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,990
Finally, water conservancy projects should be initiated

115
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,520
to prevent future occurrences of disasters.

116
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,630
Your Majesty, you answered me hastily

117
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,780
without understanding the local situation,

118
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,990
showing that you did not consider the principle

119
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,390
of adapting measures to local conditions.

120
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,670
Others' knowledge may be good,

121
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,710
but it will never become one's own.

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,049
The Empress Dowager is here.

123
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
Greetings, Your Grace.

124
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,080
Greetings, Mother.

125
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,800
Such a young Empress Dowager.

126
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,140
The ancients indeed got married and had children early.

127
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,390
Your Majesty, although I'm not your birth mother,

128
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,100
as the Empress Dowager,

129
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,310
I have the responsibility to educate you.

130
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,040
In the future, whenever you leave the palace, you should inform me.

131
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,570
Do not be angry, Mother. I know I was wrong.

132
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,010
Duke Chu,

133
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,480
since His Majesty cares about you so much,

134
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,580
why don't we accompany him

135
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,290
for a meal together today?

136
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,520
Are they having an affair?

137
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,600
Thank you for your kindness, Your Grace.

138
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,320
But I have official business to attend to.

139
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,710
I'll take my leave now.

140
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,430
Sister?

141
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,400
Me?
