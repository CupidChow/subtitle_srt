[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,600
Xiao Chu's courtesy name was Yun'an.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,280
His father was Duke Chu of Great Liang and Grand General Zhenwei.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,040
Chu had been endowed with civil and martial virtues from a young age.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,880
However, he was often in danger.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,120
He was assassinated at home when he was seven.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,160
Fortunately, a mysterious person saved him.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,680
Chu had a lot of friends and was free-spirited by nature.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,560
He inherited his father's title at 21 years old.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,080
When Chu was 28,

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,080
Prince Ning rebelled.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,160
Chu killed Prince Ning alone

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,320
but died in Prince Ning's plot.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,319
Xiao Chu, it was me who got you killed.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm really a jinx.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Xiao Chu.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,160
I won't let you die.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm going back to save you.

19
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,759
Take me back.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
Please take me back.

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,240
I beg you.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,720
Please take me back.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
An'an, come down. It's dangerous.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Don't come over.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
I killed him.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
I killed the man I loved the most.

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,000
Man?

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
You are in a relationship?

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,720
An'an, come down first.

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
I'll go with you to turn yourself in.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,530
Don't come over.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,280
I...

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,000
I want to go back to save him,

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
but I can't.

35
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,120
I can only go and accompany him.

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
An'an, calm down.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,720
Is it worth it for a stinky man?

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Xiaomei.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,570
I finally understand how the writer of that letter felt.

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,640
People all say love is bitter.

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,960
Even so, I still don't regret it.

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
An'an!

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,160
Everyone.

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,920
Let's welcome the most beautiful girl

45
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,720
in our Shangchun Brothel.

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
Great!

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Great!

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Great!

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,120
How long are you going to keep hugging me?

50
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,800
Xiao Chu.

51
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,240
Great!

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,920
You're not dead.

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,520
Miss.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm finally back.

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,159
Miss, please behave yourself.

56
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,440
What is that, Huaniang?

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
Is that the most beautiful girl in Shangchun Brothel?

58
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,200
Young Master Xiao has high standards.

59
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,960
His confidante

60
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
must be the top courtesan, right?

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,760
Right.

62
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
You're right.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,920
Why would I

64
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,080
like such an ordinary-looking girl?

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,960
Right?

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,280
You...

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Miss!

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Miss.

69
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
You're awake.

70
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Xiao Chu, you scumbag!

71
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,120
You said we'd live and die together forever.

72
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
I just died, and you're already hugging other women!

73
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,340
Indeed, a man's promise is totally unreliable!

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,640
Miss, what are you talking about?

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,160
I don't know you.

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,440
And I saved you.

77
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Why are you so angry at me?

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
You don't know me?

79
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,800
Well said!

80
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,320
I really don't know you.

81
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop it.

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,520
Your Highness, lunch is ready.

83
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,680
You can eat now.

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
I see. You may leave.

85
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
Yes.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
Your Highness?

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,800
Aren't you Duke Chu?

88
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,240
Are you Xiao Chu or not?

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll never change my name.

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,120
I am Xiao Chu.

91
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
What's wrong?

92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,400
What's going on here?

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,480
How old are you?

94
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Twenty-one.

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,880
I can't believe I traveled to seven years ago!

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,820
Aren't you hungry?

97
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,140
By the way, I don't know your name yet.

98
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
My name is Mo...

99
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,960
Wait.

100
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,120
Mo An'an, you came back to save Xiao Chu this time.

101
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
This is seven years ago.

102
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,659
Nothing has happened yet.

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,260
You can definitely save Xiao Chu.

104
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,520
My name is An Mo.
