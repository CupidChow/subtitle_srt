[Lovesickness]

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,030
Xiao Chu, you vicious man. You're over-confident.

[Episode 9]

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,510
All you know is threatening me with the antidote.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,790
Listen. I'd rather die than be a substitute.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,950
A substitute?

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,120
Don't think I don't know

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,670
you just think

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,350
I look like the girl you love.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,210
That's why you poisoned me

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,200
so that you can keep me by your side.

13
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,590
I've never seen you as a substitute.

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,000
Scumbag. Scumbag!

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,790
It's you. It's always been you.

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,410
Besides, I didn't poison you.

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,790
You tricked me?

18
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,920
If I didn't, you wouldn't have stayed.

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,240
What's wrong with you?

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,870
Fine. Since you still won't admit it,

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,330
come with me and see for yourself.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,120
Well, where are you taking me?

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,010
Seven years ago,

24
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,150
you made me a birthday cake here.

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,810
You said we should eat something

26
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,070
called a birthday cake on our birthdays.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,940
You taught me to blow out candles and make a wish.

28
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,650
I...

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,850
You...

30
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,950
Xiao Chu, slow down.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,630
You cooked hot pot for me here

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,150
and taught me how to make dipping sauce.

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,240
I... taught you?

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,150
Otherwise, how would I know

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,710
you would add sugar when you make dipping sauce?

36
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,710
Impossible.

37
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,950
I really have never been

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,270
to Duke's Mansion before this.

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,979
Xiao Chu.

40
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:47,979
And here.

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,259
You were drunk at that time

42
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,229
and kissed me

43
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,150
under the influence of alcohol.

44
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,110
Wait, this is too ridiculous.

45
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,520
You can make up something else.

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,720
How many years ago did you just say?

47
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,760
Seven years ago?

48
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,310
I was only 18 at that time.

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,150
I just graduated from high school.

50
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,710
I hadn't even been in a relationship.

51
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,830
You said I kissed you.

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,900
You think too much.

53
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,910
Indeed, it's been seven years.

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,640
You haven't changed at all.

55
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,450
Come on.

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,470
Can you make up stories based on logic?

57
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,910
You think I'm making up stories?

58
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,260
I...

59
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,750
Xiao Chu, where are you taking me again?

60
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,230
What do you want?

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,750
What do you want?

62
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,390
I... I am still a...

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,550
Look carefully.

64
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,230
Am I lying to you?

65
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
This is me?

66
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,700
I-Indeed, we resemble each other a bit.

67
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,220
You...

♫The breeze is gone and the light is on♫

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,310

it's okay if you don't want to admit it,

71

♫With joy and sorrow engraved♫

72
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,310

♫Love is like poison, and who are you?♫

78
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,560
Haitang, why are you helping him

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,570
lock me up?

80
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,950
Miss, before His Lordship left,

81
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,760
he asked you to have a good rest.

82
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,960
Xiao Chu is not here?

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,450
Haitang, do me a favor, okay?

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Can you help me invite His Majesty to come here?

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,459
I promised to read a storybook to him.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,029
Please wait a moment.

87
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,390
I'm going to report it.

88
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,860
Mo An'an, what's wrong with you?

89
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,720
It was your first kiss. So what?

90
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,990
Be clear-minded.

91
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,490
You can't be bewitched by his handsome appearance.

92
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,920
If you don't leave now, you'll lose your virginity.

93
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,610
An'an,

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,140
we got rid of the entourage.

95
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,690
Will we be in danger?

96
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,510
It's okay.

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,470
I'll protect you.

98
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,190
I'm an emperor.

99
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,400
I didn't expect

100
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,750
I would do such a sneaky thing for you today.

101
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,590
I have no appetite at all.

102
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,790
You eat it.

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,070
Take it away. Don't let me see it.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,090
I'm going to eat it if you don't.

105
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,140
Right,

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,880
don't tell Duke Chu about what happened today.

107
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,350
Don't worry.

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm on your side.

109
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,150
You won't see me soon anyway.

110
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,740
Let's go over there to take a look.

111
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,570
Where are we going?

112
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,370
To the toilet.

113
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,240
Hurry.

114
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,430
I'll distract them later.

115
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,270
Find a chance to go back to Duke's Mansion.

116
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,270
Remember, you can't believe anyone

117
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,290
except Xiao Chu.

118
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,830
What about you?

119
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,390
I have my own plan.

120
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,150
But you must be careful.

121
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,740
Stay here first.

122
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,990
Have you seen my brother?

123
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,030
He went to the toilet with me.

124
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,740
He just disappeared in the blink of an eye.

125
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,180
Where did he go?

126
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,880
What should we do? He escaped.

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,980
We have caught one at least.

128
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,640
Go back and report to our master first. Let's go.

129
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,350
Miss Mo, you're awake.

130
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,550
Prince Ning? You came to save me?

131
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,260
Hurry, untie me.

132
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:37,130
Prince Ning, what... do you want?

133
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,220
Miss Mo,

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,010
I just invited you here to be my guest.

135
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,690
Guest?

136
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,390
Is this how you treat your guest?

137
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,670
Duke Chu

138
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,800
must be very anxious now.

139
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,310
Anxious?

140
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,110
In his heart, I'm just a substitute.

141
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,840
Miss Mo, why are you belittling yourself?

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,750
Duke Chu cares about you

143
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,140
more than you think.

144
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,070
Don't worry. As long as I get this half of the Tiger Tally,

145
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,480
I won't be afraid of the little emperor.

146
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,860
Dispatch everyone.

147
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,030
I don't believe

148
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,429
she can take His Majesty out of the capital.

149
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,309
Yes.

150
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,150
Duke Chu.

151
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:44,990
Your Majesty.

152
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,310
Go save An'an now.

153
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,750
She was taken away in order to save me.

154
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,940
Your Lordship.

155
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,000
Come to the bamboo forest alone

156
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,560
at 11:45 a.m. tomorrow.

157
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,340
Give me the Tiger Tally.

158
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,000
Otherwise, you can only collect her body.
