[Lovesickness]

00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,810
[Episode 7]

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Where is Mo An'an?

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,580
Your Lordship, Miss Mo is in the kitchen.

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,910
What is she doing in the kitchen?

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,310
Miss Mo said she would cook in person today.

8
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,790
It seems that she's not that stupid.

9
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,520
She knows she should please me.

10
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,099
To enjoy yummy food, you have to stay away from someone.

11
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,590
You ancient people walk without sound.

12
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,570
Do you think you can use the things in the Duke's Mansion at will?

13
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,539
Then, let me go.

14
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,520
Do you think

15
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,940
I want to use things from the Duke's Mansion?

16
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,660
You have guts. Then, you can starve yourself.

17
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:58,830
I...

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,960
My noodles.

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,660
Take the soccer ball.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,120
Take the luminous pearl.

21
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,280
Take this set of clay teapots, too.

22
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,130
Is there anything interesting in the palace?

23
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,410
Your Majesty is so happy.

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,250
Mother.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,670
Duke Chu is recuperating at home due to the injury.

26
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,390
He can't come to the palace to teach me these days.

27
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,870
In order not to delay my studies,

28
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,829
I asked Guard Hu to take me back to the Duke's Mansion.

29
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,790
I have the Healing Elixir as a tribute from the Western Region in my palace.

30
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,430
Bring them to Duke Chu for me.

31
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,450
Yes, Mother.

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,200
[Duke's Mansion]

33
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,360
A ruler needs to know the will of the heavens and the wishes of the people.

34
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,270
It's not over yet? I'm starving!

35
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,390
As the saying goes, Tao gives birth to everything but doesn't take possession of anything.

36
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,850
It makes everything possible but never manipulates anyone. It is in a dominant position but never dictates anyone.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
If Your Majesty can't focus,

38
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,510
how can you make progress in your studies?

39
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,310
I know I was wrong.

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,390
If so,

41
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,829
finish copying "Thesis on National Strategies" tonight.

42
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,510
Yes.

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,420
Every kid can get distracted.

44
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,430
The punishment of copying books is too much.

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,670
Are you the teacher, or am I?

46
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,420
You are the teacher.

47
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,940
-But His Majesty is still young.
-In that case,

48
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,300
you can copy it with him.

49
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,870
Why should I?

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,579
Then, stay out of it.

51
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,840
Stop your cheap sympathy.

52
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,110
Xiao Chu, make it clear!

53
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,440
What do you mean by "cheap sympathy"?

54
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,990
Your Majesty, when will you execute the treacherous court official?

55
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,110
What do you want?

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,490
Count me in when you take action.

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,680
An'an, Duke Chu is not a treacherous court official.

58
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,350
Calm down.

59
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,709
He'll be destroyed by me sooner or later.

60
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,560
Why did you fight?

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,130
Who fought with him?

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,180
He's reached an early menopause.

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't think that I'm young.

64
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,270
I know a lot of things.

65
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,190
How can Duke Chu get married to a girl

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,390
with such a bad temper?

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,670
Why are you even worried about his marriage?

68
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,030
Actually, Duke Chu is quite pitiful.

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,640
The old Duke and Duchess died for the country

70
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,390
when he was very young.

71
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,190
No one cared about him anymore.

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
He has changed a lot.

73
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,950
He wasn't like this before.

74
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,810
I heard that during the reign of my father,

75
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,110
he refused to inherit the title.

76
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,350
He was as playful as I am.

77
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,310
Before Father passed away, he was worried that I had no one to rely on,

78
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,510
so he called Duke Chu to the palace

79
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,710
and asked him to shoulder the responsibilities
of ruling the country for me.

80
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,230
That's why he became like this.

81
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,470
Your father loved you very much.

82
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,510
So does Xiao Chu.

83
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,520
Otherwise, he wouldn't agree.

84
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,260
Duke Chu and I have the same fate.

85
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,390
Not long after I was born,

86
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,870
my father and mother passed away one after another.

87
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,080
I just want to grow up quickly and share his burden.

88
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,650
Why didn't you send someone to let me know

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,710
that His Majesty went out of the palace?

90
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,070
Why should I send someone to let you know, Prince Ning?

91
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,110
Why?

92
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,930
Don't you know about Xiao Chu?

93
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,030
His Majesty went to the Duke's Mansion.

94
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,020
If His Majesty relies more and more on him,

95
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,060
will our plan work?

96
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,870
Are you lecturing me?

97
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,630
I dare not.

98
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,930
I just want to share your burden, Your Grace.

99
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,590
I haven't finished yet.

100
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,280
Why were you in such a hurry?

101
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,400
His Majesty is not young anymore.

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,930
Duke Chu sent someone to take His Majesty home

103
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,700
to continue his studies.

104
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,740
How could I stop it?

105
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,610
His Majesty didn't return all night after leaving the palace.

106
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,430
The Empress Dowager is worried about His Majesty,

107
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,630
so she wants to visit him in the Duke's Mansion.

108
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,350
As the imperial uncle, I miss my nephew, too.

109
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,400
Then, I'll invite Prince Ning to come with me.

110
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,110
Yes.

111
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,270
Almost.

112
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,590
A little higher.

113
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,560
Almost.

114
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,950
A little higher.

115
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,470
Almost.

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,210
An'an, be careful.

117
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,050
Miss Mo.

118
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,909
Miss Mo, are you okay?

119
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,150
I'm fine.

120
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,230
Is there no one in the mansion

121
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,670
if Duke Chu is not in?

122
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
Mother, Prince Ning.

123
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,270
Your Majesty.

124
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,340
An'an, are you alright?

125
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm fine.

126
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,430
Fortunately, Prince Ning saved my life.

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,360
Thank you so much.

128
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,930
Miss Mo, what you did just now

129
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,950
really scared me.

130
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,490
I found Miss Mo lively and cute.

131
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,870
But as a woman,

132
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,860
that action is way too dangerous.

133
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,150
I can't agree with you, Prince Ning.

134
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,650
So what I'm a woman?

135
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,390
Women can hold up half of the sky.

136
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,950
Women can join the army and fight the battles.

137
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,630
Women can even be monarchs.

138
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,280
They can lead the country to prosperity.

139
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,280
Who says women are inferior to men?

140
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,270
Mother.

141
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,990
I suddenly feel unwell.

142
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,570
I want to go back to the palace to rest.

143
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,190
Does Your Majesty want to go back with me together?

144
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,910
I want to stay here in the Duke's Mansion for a few more days.

145
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,710
Don't worry, Mother.

146
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,120
Then, make the decision that suits you best.

147
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,620
Xiaoyu.

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,500
I respectfully see Mother off back to the palace.
