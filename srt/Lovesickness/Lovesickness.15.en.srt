00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,520
I'll pour you some tea again, Sister.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,920
Yuzhu,

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,360
your sister doesn't seem to be willing

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,080
to serve us tea.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,290
But she's the second daughter of the Prime Minister's Mansion, after all.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,610
No, it's not like that, Sister.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,720
Sister.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,120
It's my treat today. Enjoy yourselves.

10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,760
Miss An, don't reveal your wealth.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
Be careful you'll be targeted by thieves.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,340
One of you is the young master of Duke Chu's Mansion,

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,040
and the other is the Lady of Prime Minister's Mansion.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,560
You're both richer than me.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,120
How could the thief target me?

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,960
Miss An,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,520
I'll treat you to this meal today.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,440
Thank you, Brother Xiao Chu and Miss An,

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,880
for helping me.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,900
You are so good at pretending!

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,010
We just helped you because we can't stand injustice.

22
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,760
But you just let her bully you like that?

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,000
She is my sister

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,340
and the legitimate daughter of the Prime Minister.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600
I'm just an illegitimate daughter.

26
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,440
Yuchan, although you don't have a high birth like Zhao Yuzhu,

27
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
you are famous for your talent in the capital.

28
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,940
You shouldn't belittle yourself like that.

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,000
Brother Xiao Chu, do you really think so?

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,759
Of course.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,759
That's right.

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,880
I've long heard

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Lady Zhao is famous for her talent in the capital.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,780
You deserve your reputation.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,490
I'd like to propose a toast to you with this cup of tea, Lady Zhao.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,840
Thank you, Miss An.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,320
I don't know why,

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,320
but the first time

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,240
I saw you,

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
I really liked you.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,079
Can I visit you at the Prime Minister's Mansion?

42
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,360
Of course.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,079
Miss An, it's a deal, then.

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,040
You must come and visit me.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Of course.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,600
Brother Xiao Chu. Miss An.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm leaving.

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,600
I…

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,200
You go first.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
I'll go first.

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,280
Your Highness, thank you for taking me in these days.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,760
I won't bother you anymore.

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,160
Miss An, are you trying to break the bridge after crossing the river?

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,960
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,280
I am just a commoner.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,900
How would I dare to use you?

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,560
Forget it.

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,650
I won't ask if you don't want to tell me.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,360
Everyone has some secrets

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
that they can't tell others.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,760
Xiao Chu.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Promise me

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,740
you will live for yourself in the future.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Okay?

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,920
Watch out!

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,200
Xiao Chu.

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,600
Extreme bad luck. Extreme bad luck!

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,080
A star of calamity appeared indistinctly. The Emperor Star Ziwei is dim.

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Extreme bad luck. Extreme bad luck!

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,240
Xiao Chu, I will never be your star of calamity in this life.

71
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,560
Goodbye, Your Highness.

72
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,960
I wish you all the best in the future.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,120
Manager,

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,520
give me your best room.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
Our best room?

76
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,600
500 pence per night.

77
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,000
Look here. You can't pay on credit.

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
Distinguished guest, pardon me for my rudeness earlier.

79
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Erniu, hurry! Take this guest to our best room.

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
Okay. Please.

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
No, it's too bloody.

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,640
Killing people is so hard.

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,760
Who is it?

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,600
Ma'am,

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,450
I brought you tea and desserts.

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
Come in.

87
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Ma'am,

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
there have been rats in our hotel recently.

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,340
Let me sprinkle some rat poison in your room.

90
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Rats? Sprinkle it now.

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,320
What are you waiting for?

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,880
Wait.

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,600
Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
I suppose rat poison can poison people, too.

95
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,120
Is it bitter?

96
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
What if she can't drink it?

97
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,500
I'll just try it first.

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
There's no other way.

99
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,440
Huaniang.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,840
This one is quality good.

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,960
Bah!

102
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
I've already

103
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,640
examined the girl.

104
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,970
Her limbs are stiff.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm afraid she's never learned to dance.

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,200
Look at her delicate palms.

107
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,120
There's no callus at all.

108
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,800
I guess she doesn't know how to play any musical instrument, either.

109
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,720
Only her face is passable.

110
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,360
She really knows how to insult people!

111
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,680
Just give me some more money.

112
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,120
What's the use of just looking good?
