00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,480
Is that okay?

4
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,710
- No.
- Feel it yourself.

5
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,620
She brought her daughter

6
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,280
to take flying lessons last month.

7
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,860
Now she wants to get a pilot's license.

8
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
You can teach her.

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,420
I already have four students.

10
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,670
Four isn't that many.

11
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,990
Can't fit them all. Really.

12
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,830
Coach.

13
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,780
Let me do it.

14
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,410
Don't you hate female students the most?

15
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,030
I...

16
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,870
Need money.

17
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,620
Okay.

18
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,270
You really want to go?

19
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,410
Didn't we agree on this?

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,700
Okay, at 2 pm.

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,940
Meet at our company entrance first.

22
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,460
After the gallery,
we'll find a place to eat.

23
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,600
- I'll book a table.
- Okay.

24
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,250
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

25
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,320
Bye, Dad.

26
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,300
Bye-bye.

27
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,650
- What about you?
- Both of us.

28
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,020
Mr. He,

29
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,930
what plane are we flying today?

30
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,650
Which one do you want to fly?

31
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,030
You need 25 hours of theory

32
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,000
before flying.

33
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,530
Didn't the sales tell you?

34
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,550
I rode for over an hour to get here.

35
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,670
You're telling me I can't fly?

36
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,650
Can't you combine theory with practice?

37
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,840
Start with the theory first.

38
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,510
Okay.

39
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,080
Mr. Huang isn't here yet.

40
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,100
(Honey)

41
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,100
(Honey)

42
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,440
Where are you?
I'm at the company entrance.

43
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,400
What's going on? Are you going or not?

44
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,370
I won't wait for you. I'm leaving.

45
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,510
Let's go.

46
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,430
Okay.

47
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,550
When the plane starts accelerating
and reaches 80 kilometers per hour,

48
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,390
lift the nose wheel.

49
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,860
When the altitude
reaches 300 on one side,

50
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,200
flaps down, lights off, fuel pump off.

51
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,200
Next, cross-wind leg and downwind leg.

52
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
The cruising speed is 140 km/h
on the downwind leg.

53
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,930
During downwind leg flight,

54
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,490
make sure all instruments

55
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,610
are in the green zone.

56
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,780
Next is the base leg.

57
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,850
The airspeed is 130 km/h.

58
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,340
The airspeed on the final approach
is near 120 km/h.

59
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,180
Finally, landing.

60
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,620
Air traffic pattern involves

61
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,960
two takeoffs, two landings,
and a level flight.

62
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,760
Take off at the upwind
and cross-wind leg.

63
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,640
Level at the downwind leg, descend
on the base, and land at the final approach.

64
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,110
Do you remember what I said?

65
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes.

66
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,200
Then tell me.

67
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,490
What are the five structures
of the aircraft?

68
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,000
The fuselage, wings, tail,

69
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,550
powerplant, and landing gear.

70
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,590
How about the aircraft systems?

71
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,620
Control system, landing gear system,

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,380
electrical system, and fuel system.

73
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,220
And the tail?

74
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,730
Vertical tail and horizontal tail.

75
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,910
What about landing gear?

76
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,850
Fixed and retractable.

77
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,660
Right?

78
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,460
Right.

79
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,490
You're a quick learner.

80
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,260
Today, that's all for now.

81
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,960
If you have any questions,
you can ask me.

82
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,220
Okay.

83
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,150
That's it then.

84
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,990
Mr. He,

85
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,220
see you next time.

86
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,580
Bye-bye.

87
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,640
Learning fast, walking fast too.

88
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,100
(Flight training paper)

89
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,950
What's wrong?

90
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,440
Mr. He.

91
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,200
The motorcycle suddenly stalled.

92
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,690
Let me take a look.

93
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,440
Stalled?

94
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,780
Forget it.

95
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,050
I'll call for roadside assistance.

96
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,490
It's expensive.

97
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,370
We're so far from the city.

98
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,520
Just calling a tow truck
will cost hundreds.

99
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,640
So expensive?

100
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,370
If you trust me,

101
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,440
I can push it to the base first.

102
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,810
I'll fix it for you in a couple of days.

103
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,790
Can you fix it?

104
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,680
I studied mechanics.

105
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,430
I like tinkering in my spare time too.

106
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,270
No big deal.

107
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,980
Okay then.

108
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,740
It's fine now.

109
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,640
Thank you.

110
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,740
Don't worry.
I'll come early tomorrow morning.

111
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,610
No one will touch it.

112
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,040
No one will touch this old motorcycle.

113
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,210
There's no bus at this hour.

114
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,270
How will you get back?

115
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,950
I'll take a taxi.

116
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,270
Let me call one for you.

117
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,990
No need. I can manage it myself.

118
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,590
It's late. It's not safe for you alone.

119
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,610
I'll call for you. I can see the route.

120
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,700
My place is far.

121
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,160
The fare will be a hundred or two.

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,700
Then

123
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,920
add me on WeChat.

124
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,550
Transfer it when you get home.

125
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,910
Okay.

126
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,540
(From Beginning to End)

127
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,250
Here on your face.

128
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,580
Wait.

129
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,270
Thank you.

130
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,380
Sir.

131
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,570
- Later...
- Send me a message when you get home.

132
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,750
Send me a message later.

133
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,920
I'll transfer the fare to you.

134
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,470
It's not about that.

135
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,310
It's okay.

136
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,670
I'm leaving.

137
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,040
- Bye-bye.
- See you next time.

138
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,380
(Badaling Airport)

139
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,870
Finally home.

140
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,900
Not at home? Where did he go?

141
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,850
Really.

142
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,790
Huang Zhenhua!

143
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,590
- Dad, Dad!
- Huang Zhenhua!

144
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,540
Dad, Dad!

145
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,640
Are you dead?

146
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,030
What's wrong with you?

147
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,470
Broken bones. What are you doing?

148
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,540
- Twisted my back.
- Go, go, go.

149
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,030
Get your dad the red flower oil.

150
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,130
In the small cabinet with medicine inside.

151
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,500
You're finally back.

152
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,350
What's going on?

153
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,800
How did you twist your back?

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,400
Twenty kilos.

155
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,760
You asked for it.

156
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,900
What's wrong with 20 kilos?

157
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,230
It used to be 30 kilos.

158
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,250
I could lift two.

159
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,540
When was that?

160
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,660
You've become weaker now.

161
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,160
So I wanted to exercise.

162
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,350
The lunch was in the afternoon,

163
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,620
so you exercised in the morning?

164
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,730
Did you think

165
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,300
this could reduce a few pounds of fat?

166
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,130
Or could it make you look stronger?

167
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,450
It's not about him.

168
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,150
Son,

169
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,570
go in and play with the iPad.

170
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,150
Wait a moment.

171
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,730
Put on your shoes. It's cold.

172
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,620
Sure.

173
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,510
Why is my face hurting?

174
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,350
Go ahead.

175
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,760
What? Let me help you get up

176
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,620
Don't lie down here anymore.

177
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,040
I've lain down for a day.
My belly is cold.

178
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,710
I'll give you a blanket and cover you up.

179
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,680
Come on, try to get up.

180
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
What's wrong with this arm?

181
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,580
- What's wrong?
- My arm is numb. Don't.

182
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,780
- Numb?
- Yes, give me...

183
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,900
How did you get numb?

184
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,350
I've kept this posture

185
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,580
for half a day.

186
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,190
Let me move it for you, okay?

187
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,660
- Massage it.
- Is this okay?

188
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,020
- What's wrong with my face?
- Is this numb here?

189
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,250
Why is my face hurting?

190
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,430
Let me see.

191
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,450
Why is my face hurting?

192
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,090
Why are you laughing?

193
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,570
There is a waffle on your face.

194
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,030
How can you laugh at me?

195
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,700
Huang Zhenhua, you're really funny.

196
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,800
Don't move. I'll take a picture of you.

197
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,090
How can you treat me like this?

198
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,640
Don't move, don't move.

199
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,740
Smile.

200
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,620
Yes, here, here.

201
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,460
Just here.

202
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,110
Don't, don't.

203
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,570
Be gentle. Be gentle.

204
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,910
Well,

205
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,460
he said

206
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,970
he wants to give you money.

207
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,160
How much is this?

208
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,700
300,000.

209
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,400
300,000 yuan?

210
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,740
Can you refuse it?

211
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,580
Why?

212
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,330
I don't want his money.

213
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,250
That's my money.

214
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,780
Didn't he give it to you before?

215
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,030
Besides, we don't need it.

216
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,450
Who said so?

217
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,730
Did your company make money last year?

218
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,640
I just don't want his money.

219
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,450
That's my money.

220
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,750
Why didn't he give it earlier?

221
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,710
Suddenly he's asking you out

222
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,710
to dinner and to see exhibitions.

223
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,310
What does he want to do?

224
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,270
He doesn't want anything.

225
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,660
Huang Zhenhua, what do you want to do?

226
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,090
Why aren't you manly at all?

227
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,400
What do you mean by that?

228
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,130
What have I done that's unmanly?

229
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,300
I just earned less in the past two years.

230
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,350
Don't keep using that to disgust me.

231
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,820
When did I think
you weren't earning enough?

232
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,950
Did I ever say that?

233
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,850
Just now,

234
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,240
you said we needed money

235
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,540
and asked me how much I earned last year.

236
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,920
Isn't that what you just said?

237
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,000
Why have you become so vulgar now?

238
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,140
You're refined, right?

239
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,640
Fine, let's tally it up.

240
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,040
How much mortgage
do we have to pay monthly?

241
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,400
How much does Pudding's tuition cost?

242
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,880
During the prosperous years
of the company,

243
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,230
didn't we save a lot of money?
It could last a few years.

244
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,400
So we'll wait until it runs out?

245
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,060
Pudding will be going
to elementary school.

246
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,880
There will be many expenses in the future.

247
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,750
It's still two years
before he starts school.

248
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,660
Isn't it too early for you to be anxious?

249
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,260
You're just too untroubled.

250
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,730
What's the use of me being anxious?

251
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,230
Our industry isn't thriving now.

252
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,620
There were fewer houses being built.

253
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,860
Even fewer can afford

254
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,020
our company's qualifications.

255
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,950
Only a company

256
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,060
with taste can afford to hire you.

257
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,380
Then I can't go

258
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,590
and do low-level and tacky work.

259
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,380
Alright. Don't do anything.

260
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,950
You just lead your company

261
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,160
living off your trophies.

262
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,630
Seriously, Huang Zhenhua.

263
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,990
I'm not anxious about money.

264
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,740
I'm anxious about your state.

265
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,140
Think about these past two years.

266
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,390
Are you becoming

267
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,500
more and more lazy and slack?

268
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,860
Even your mom noticed it.

269
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,950
I had to cover for you in front of her,

270
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,110
saying that your company is temporarily

271
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,380
transitioning its business.

272
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,590
I haven't told you yet.

273
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,000
Your mom gave me 100,000 yuan.

274
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,380
She told me not to tell you.

275
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,900
You didn't want
to take others' money, right?

276
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,180
Then return this money

277
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,020
to your mom.

278
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,150
Right here, there's a sore spot.

279
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,040
Endure a little longer.

280
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,370
Endure it. It'll be over soon.

281
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,730
Hold on.

282
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,850
Almost. Almost done.

283
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,100
Hold on.

284
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,990
Hold on.

285
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,070
- Okay.
- No, no.

286
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,900
Lie down for another 20 minutes.

287
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,230
Twenty minutes, and it'll be fine.

288
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,070
Endure a little longer.

289
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,370
How did your back
get hurt like this last night?

290
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,680
What are you thinking?

291
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,200
I slept on the sofa yesterday.

292
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,770
Why did you sleep on the sofa?

293
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,480
You quarreled?

294
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,640
Something happened during the meeting?

295
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,920
I didn't even meet him at all.

296
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,140
I arranged for a female colleague

297
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,910
to liaise with you on the investment.

298
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,950
Her name is Han Ying.

299
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,630
She studied art abroad, very talented.

300
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,810
I'll introduce her to you on WeChat.

301
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,540
(Peng Songtao)

302
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
(Peng Songtao)

303
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,100
Hello.

304
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,030
Hello.

305
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,780
Why do I feel

306
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,530
you want to distance yourself from me?

307
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,630
No, I studied management.

308
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,660
You need more professionalism

309
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,390
and artistic sensitivity.

310
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,770
Han Ying can help more.

311
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,230
Okay.

312
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,270
I'll listen to you.

313
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,770
Do you think I'm petty?

314
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,920
Not that petty.

315
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,270
She's pretty honest with me.

316
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,850
I asked her and she told me the truth.

317
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,540
It was a good thing,

318
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,880
but I overreacted.

319
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,200
I am her husband, right?

320
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,580
Which husband can be comfortable

321
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,640
with this?

322
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,470
Can't I be jealous?

323
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,310
Yes.

324
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,530
Can't she act cute and coax me?

325
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,130
Can't she learn to speak softly?

326
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,740
With your back like this,

327
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,160
can you go to the dinner party tomorrow?

328
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,200
Can't go. I have something tomorrow.

329
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,230
No.

330
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,290
I have something now.

331
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,090
I need to get back all the money
owed to our company.

332
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,610
Isn't it just making money?

333
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,880
Who can't do it?

334
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,990
Zhenhua,

335
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,130
you should have done this long ago.

336
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,260
I have to let my woman know

337
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,950
her husband is not only diligent

338
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,100
but also has

339
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,770
a broad mind.

340
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,900
I've forgiven her

341
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,370
about this.

342
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,660
Mom,

343
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,240
we don't have a plane.

344
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,400
Why do you want
to learn to pilot a plane?

345
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,200
It's fun.

346
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,920
Even at this age,

347
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,240
you still have to go to class
and take exams.

348
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,880
Isn't it restrictive?

349
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,130
Studying is for freedom.

350
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,920
Studying is the least free thing
in the world.

351
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,570
Once you learn how to study,

352
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,990
you can learn whatever you want

353
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,770
and study whatever you need.

354
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,180
Then you'll be free.

355
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,680
Is this a tongue twister?

356
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,090
I don't understand.

357
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,470
It's okay.

358
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,330
Read more books.

359
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,090
You'll understand gradually.

360
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,180
Mom,

361
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,480
you're different from
my classmates' moms.

362
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
How am I different?

363
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,810
You never yell at me.

364
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,440
I feel like you're scheming against me,

365
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,390
but I don't know

366
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,850
how you're doing it.

367
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,050
Let me tell you how I do that.

368
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,960
You're my child.

369
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,430
I don't expect you
to know what I don't know,

370
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,380
but for what I do know,

371
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,880
I believe you will also know.

372
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,100
Simple, right?

373
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,310
So in the future,

374
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,240
can I learn to pilot a plane too?

375
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,680
Of course.

376
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,920
But you'll have to earn your tuition.

377
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,200
(He Xi)
Your motorcycle has been fixed.

378
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,540
You're amazing.

379
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,480
How did you fix it?

380
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,530
It just ran out of gas.

381
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,620
Impossible. I just checked.

382
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,370
The tank still had half a tank of gas.

383
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,190
The fuel gauge is inaccurate.

384
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,440
I replaced the fuel float for you.

385
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,580
It should be fine now.

386
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,530
Thank you so much.

387
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,850
You've been riding this bike

388
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,640
for so many years, right?

389
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,100
Six years.

390
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,200
Parts for this model
are no longer produced.

391
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,720
I found them online.

392
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,050
Motorcycles are supposed to be scrapped
after 13 years.

393
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,570
Have you considered getting a new one?

394
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,090
How much is the repair cost with parts?

395
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,570
No need. It didn't cost much.

396
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,750
Alright.

397
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,190
Then let me treat you to a meal.

398
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,030
What do you want?

399
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm fine with anything.

400
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,400
Sorry, I have to take this call.

401
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,230
Hello.

402
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,810
Why not?

403
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,880
Why am I the only one being punished?

404
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,570
Sorry.

405
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,160
I can't make it.

406
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,180
Is everything okay?

407
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,240
I'll go back to the dorm first.

408
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,720
Take care on the way.

409
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,790
Okay.

410
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,200
The approach speed is a bit high.

411
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,500
1,800 for ground speed is not high.

412
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,810
- Hi.
- Almost.

413
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,640
Still feels high.

414
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,370
Anything else?

415
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,550
Didn't go flying?

416
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,370
Didn't draw?

417
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,240
They called me.

418
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,420
Can you go back?

419
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,010
The training center said

420
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,530
they can't revoke my warning

421
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,240
and ruled me unqualified.

422
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,430
I can't proceed

423
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,770
with further training and assessment.

424
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,240
The company has received the result,

425
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,370
canceled my qualifications,

426
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,770
and won't pay for further training fees.

427
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,680
What

428
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,160
are your plans next?

429
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,680
I still want to fly.

430
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,200
If I can't go to the company,

431
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,810
I'll just pay for my own education.

432
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,850
After finishing, I'll apply again.

433
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,810
The tuition is 600,000.

434
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,640
Do you have that much money?

435
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,200
Do you remember
the takeoff and landing data?

436
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,710
Yes.

437
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,580
The front wheel speed
is 80 miles per hour.

438
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,300
The Vx is 110.

439
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,810
The Vy is 130.

440
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,010
Are you ready?

441
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,720
Check the fuel gauge.

442
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,850
Fuel tank, wing flaps.

443
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,960
- Can you take off?
- Thirty. Forty-five.

444
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,530
Stop. Brake release.

445
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,810
Please reply.

446
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,400
The control tower
has reminded you three times.

447
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,010
Wait, wait.

448
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,130
You're spending your money.

449
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,810
It starts charging
once the propeller spins.

450
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,140
Inspection complete.

451
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,860
And then?

452
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,990
Then?

453
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,050
Report to the control tower.

454
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,480
12NC, requesting permission
to start the takeoff training.

455
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,790
Permission granted.

456
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,100
Answer machine, 0240, field pressure 946.

457
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,530
Answer, 0240, field pressure 946.

458
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,850
12NC.

459
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,940
(Press to start)

460
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,160
Pulling too much. Push down.

461
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,990
Come on.

462
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,400
Are you fighting this jet, so wild?

463
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,530
What's going on?

464
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,960
There's an airstream. Don't panic.

465
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,270
Grab the joystick.

466
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,010
Hand on the throttle.

467
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,180
What should be done?

468
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,960
What should be done?

469
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,240
I'm asking you.

470
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,480
What should be done?

471
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,140
Read the meter.

472
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,400
The height is 300, and the speed is 160.

473
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,810
The power is 4,300.

474
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,440
Turn left on the side.

475
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,570
Pitch pressure 20 degrees.

476
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,620
A little slower.

477
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,440
Yes, a little slower.

478
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,610
Reduce throttle. The engine power.

479
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,540
2,800.

480
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,530
2,800 is going down to the ground.

481
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,330
12NC, align with the five sides.

482
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,750
Slower.

483
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,130
What was that?

484
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,940
You...

485
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,290
Why are you laughing?

486
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
You're familiar
with theoretical knowledge.

487
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,500
Why were you acting
like a fool on the plane?

488
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,430
Why is this plane so bumpy?

489
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,920
Wasn't it stable last time?

490
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,780
The weather conditions
are different today.

491
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,720
Today is a level-four wind.

492
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,860
And today this plane

493
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,150
is smaller than the one you experienced.

494
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,880
You said 2,800 on the descent.

495
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,570
What does that mean?

496
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,920
I never said it.

497
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,570
It happened ten minutes ago.
How can you forget?

498
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,480
I remember you said "descend".

499
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,430
I need to reduce the throttle.
It's okay if it's fully closed.

500
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,190
The plane can glide back by itself.

501
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,240
2,800?

502
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,230
What's going on with 2,800?

503
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,330
I definitely didn't say that.

504
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,920
You don't have
a split personality, right?

505
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,950
The one up there is Huang Yimei II.

506
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,540
The one down here is Huang Yimei I.

507
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,010
I wish I had a split personality.

508
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,780
It requires looking at the direction

509
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
and the instruments.

510
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,060
I had to talk with the control tower,

511
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,640
and you kept asking questions.

512
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,300
Two personalities aren't enough.

513
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,330
I had to ask.

514
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,870
What's the maneuvering speed in airspace?

515
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,740
175.

516
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,880
You were flying at 190.

517
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,140
Also,

518
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,780
why didn't you reply

519
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,260
to the control tower's
landing runway prompt?

520
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,400
Aren't we back?

521
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,470
Why are you still asking?

522
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,880
Of course.

523
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,850
There's the flight review after landing.

524
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,720
You still have a lot of problems.

525
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:22,500
(He Xi: Will next week's flight class
still be held?)

526
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,180
(Rose: Why not?)

527
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,780
(He Xi: Judging from your state today,
I thought you couldn't learn anymore.)

528
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,540
(Rose: I! Can! Learn!)

529
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,940
(He Xi: Should you discuss it
with Huang Yimei II?)

530
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,420
(Rose: She agreed.)

531
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,100
(He Xi: Tell Huang Yimei II for me
not to scare me so much next time.)

532
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,420
(Rose: She said okay.
She doesn't want to die with you.)

533
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,700
(He Xi: See you next week,
Huang Yimei I and Huang Yimei II.)

534
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,980
(Rose: Okay, Mr. He Xi (Huang Yimei I).)

535
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,860
(Rose: See you next week,
Mr. He Xi (Huang Yimei II).)

536
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,550
Hello.

537
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,960
Are you Huang Yimei I or II?

538
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,100
Rest assured. We are both ready today.

539
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,850
We won't be as nervous as last time.

540
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,640
Can't fly now.

541
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,920
It's going to rain soon.

542
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,880
Why did you hit me?

543
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,530
This way. Come on. Hurry up.

544
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,770
Go, go.

545
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,880
Pudding, where's your dad?

546
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,570
He's on a call.

547
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,390
Mr. Liu, I understand what you said.

548
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,570
But we also have difficulties.

549
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,470
You've delayed it
for more than three years.

550
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,540
I didn't want you

551
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,500
to give all of it to me now.

552
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,840
You can pay an installment
over a year, right?

553
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,940
You're back.

554
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,870
- What's this?
- Go, go.

555
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,710
Try this.

556
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,090
Well.

557
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,090
It's pretty good.

558
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,460
Instructions.

559
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,930
This feels like that tendon's really

560
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,540
been moved aside.

561
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,270
Thanks, dear.

562
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,240
Thirsty? Shall I pour you some water?

563
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,310
Okay.

564
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,010
- Have something hot.
- Thanks.

565
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,320
Do you think
we'll get struck by lightning

566
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,760
if we encounter this weather in the air?

567
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,680
There's a possibility.

568
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,830
But our flying altitude

569
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,950
is below 1,000 meters,

570
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,790
so it's unlikely.

571
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,200
What's the worst weather
you've encountered?

572
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,410
Before,

573
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,930
I was taking flight lessons in Florida,

574
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,320
and I encountered a thunderstorm.

575
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,970
That time, we had to divert

576
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,530
and could only fly with gritted teeth.

577
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,930
You studied flying abroad?

578
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,160
I majored in
mechanical design and manufacturing.

579
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,610
When I graduated,

580
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,890
I got the opportunity to change my major.

581
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,430
I saw the CAAC's recruitment brochure

582
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,410
and immediately signed up.

583
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,280
The interview and medical exam
went smoothly.

584
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,240
The company sent us

585
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,450
to a flight school
in Florida for training.

586
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,060
After passing the exams,

587
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,800
I could get a pilot's license
from the CAAC.

588
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,710
No wonder.

589
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,490
I saw a photo in your Moments before.

590
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,680
So why did you come back

591
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,240
to work here as an instructor?

592
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,970
I got grounded.

593
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,800
We asked the reserved pilots
who were there.

594
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,500
They all said they saw you hit him.

595
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,580
He was racist.

596
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,790
Emotional stability

597
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,180
is a key indicator of pilot fitness.

598
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,390
You have shown that

599
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,890
you're not able to control your emotions.

600
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,540
As of now,

601
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,790
you are grounded.

602
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,490
Hand over your flight credentials.

603
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,630
Rest assured.

604
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,450
I don't have a pilot's license
from the CAAC,

605
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,180
but I have a general pilot's license

606
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,160
and teaching qualifications.

607
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,280
I can fully teach these courses here.

608
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,090
Don't worry about safety issues.

609
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,320
What about your parents?

610
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,760
Did you tell them?

611
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,050
I told them

612
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,280
I didn't get my license

613
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,610
because I didn't pass the exam.

614
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,720
They were happy about it.

615
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,890
When I applied to be a pilot,

616
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,640
they were strongly against it.

617
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,830
Why?

618
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,160
They thought it was too tough

619
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,420
and too dangerous.

620
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,430
They hoped I would find a stable job,

621
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,790
follow the routine,

622
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,830
buy a house,

623
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,670
get married,

624
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,020
and have children.

625
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
They thought
that's what life should be like.

626
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,410
What about yourself?

627
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,610
How do you feel about it?

628
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,320
I've been waiting
for their message all year,

629
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,680
hoping to go back

630
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,280
to continue studying.

631
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,570
The company finally called me a while ago

632
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,380
and told me

633
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,610
they canceled the job offer.

634
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,870
From childhood to now,

635
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,760
I've never ranked outside the top three.

636
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,320
I entered CAAC recruitment

637
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,680
with the top score.

638
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,840
My classmates who trained with me

639
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,800
have already gotten their pilot's licenses

640
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,680
and become CAAC pilots.

641
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,060
And me?

642
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,890
Just because of a momentary impulse,

643
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,640
I've ruined my whole life.

644
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,200
How old are you
to talk about your whole life?

645
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,760
Isn't it too early?

646
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,990
I'm already 24.

647
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,240
You're only 24.

648
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,720
Are you trying to say

649
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,720
being young
means unlimited possibilities?

650
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,680
Is that so?

651
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,050
Yes, I mean to say

652
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,970
you may encounter greater setbacks later,

653
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,680
and not just one.

654
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,800
Do you think I haven't suffered enough?

655
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,540
By then, you'll realize

656
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,090
this setback isn't such a big deal.

657
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,930
Besides life and death,

658
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,640
nothing is a big deal.

659
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,950
For people your age,

660
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,680
you think nothing's a big deal, right?

661
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,050
I don't mean to say you're old.

662
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,180
I am older than you,

663
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,620
and quite a bit older.

664
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,090
But I have one advantage.

665
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,050
I'm shameless.

666
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,060
How shameless?

667
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,450
I never admit I can't do something.

668
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,240
If one try doesn't work, try more times.

669
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,160
After all, I'm only 40.

670
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,410
I might make it to 90.

671
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,610
That gives me another 50 years.

672
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,570
I'm just a kid right now

673
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,890
with plenty of time.

674
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,680
Whatever I want to do, I'll do it.

675
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,140
As long as I take the first step,

676
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,610
I'm on the road to success.

677
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,680
Has the rain stopped?

678
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,110
Are we flying?

679
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,340
Yes.

680
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,350
Are you ready,

681
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,190
Huang Yimei II?

682
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,340
Ready.

683
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,890
Tower, tower.
