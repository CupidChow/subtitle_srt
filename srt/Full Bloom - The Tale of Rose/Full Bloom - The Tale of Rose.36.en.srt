00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,980
I won't live with you.

4
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,820
I won't stay there.

5
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,620
You're old enough.

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,340
You should know better.

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,710
How old are you?

8
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,900
Almost 40, still a bachelor,

9
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,150
living with your dad.

10
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,380
You should know better.

11
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,670
I chose such a big apartment

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,510
to make it convenient for you.

13
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,980
I don't need your care.

14
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm doing just fine.

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,060
I'm staying here.
I'm not going anywhere.

16
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,030
Even close family needs distance.

17
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,310
The reason we get along so well

18
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,150
is the distance
between Beijing and Europe.

19
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,390
Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,780
Fine.

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,180
Here.

22
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,030
The room is yours if you want it.

23
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,950
It's up to you.

24
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,620
You really don't plan to go back?

25
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,830
No.

26
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,150
I'm back for good.

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,900
What? Not happy about it?

28
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,670
No matter

29
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,990
where you are,

30
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,270
your heart has never a 30-mile radius

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,830
of this place.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,060
Come on, like father, like son.

33
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,870
We both can't keep

34
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,030
to one person.

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,150
Oh, please.

36
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,270
Those who claim to be playboys

37
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,940
are usually the most faithful.

38
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,740
Emotional debts

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,030
in this world

40
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,150
are messy and uncountable.

41
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,950
You owe her,

42
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,550
and she owes someone else.

43
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,390
It's all interconnected.

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,220
Debts must be repaid,

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,830
but not necessarily

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,310
to the same person.

47
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
You owe Rose,

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,620
and Fu Jiaming repaid it.

49
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,620
Who will repay

50
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,110
what he owes?

51
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,870
That's unknown.

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,710
Dad, let's drink.

53
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,430
Let's stop talking about me.

54
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,230
Tell me about yourself.

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,740
How's the TV adaptation

56
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,580
of your novel going?

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,460
Is it going to happen?

58
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,660
It's happening soon.

59
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,150
I'm telling you. It's a big IP,

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,900
big investment, and big production,

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,030
with big stars

62
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,780
and a famous director.

63
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,740
So, you must've
made a lot from the rights?

64
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,550
I don't care much about money.

65
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,030
Will the domestic series

66
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,660
be broadcast in France?

67
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,780
Yes.

68
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,990
Good.

69
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,460
Dad,

70
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,150
are you hoping

71
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,190
Mom will see it in France

72
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,420
and you'll impress her?

73
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,510
So what if I am?

74
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,830
Sure, sure.

75
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,780
Drinking alone?

76
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,990
Cheers.

77
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,100
Mom and Dad asked around.

78
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,460
Pudding is a third-generation child

79
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,660
without a school household register,

80
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,760
so he can't get into the school here.

81
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,100
He's only four.

82
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,590
He's almost five.

83
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,710
Primary school
is just around the corner.

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,590
With your scholarly parents,

85
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,710
what's there to worry about?

86
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,100
We wanted to be closer to Mom and Dad.

87
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,630
For a cultured family,

88
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,860
this is the place to be.

89
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,340
We bought the house

90
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,420
in a rush.

91
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,980
If it weren't for your loan,

92
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,630
we wouldn't have made
the down payment so quickly.

93
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,030
It wasn't a loan.

94
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,660
Back when Fang started his business,

95
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,900
my brother lent him the startup funds.

96
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,030
I should be thanking you.

97
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,630
That money

98
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,510
was repaid with interest long ago.

99
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,470
That's different.

100
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,510
I'll definitely pay you back.

101
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,620
Alright.

102
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,190
When I'm short on money,

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,460
I'll come to you first.

104
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,270
During pregnancy,

105
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,780
I thought childbirth

106
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,100
was the biggest hurdle.

107
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,750
But raising a child is even harder.

108
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,670
Breastfeeding,

109
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,030
illnesses,

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,940
schooling.

111
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,190
One hurdle after another.

112
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,540
When does it end?

113
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,220
Maybe you should see Dr. Liu.

114
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,980
You seem anxious lately.

115
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,390
Which mom isn't anxious?

116
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,030
Now I understand

117
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,220
why they say to have kids early.

118
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,660
I'm 40.

119
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,510
My child isn't in school yet.

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,780
When he's a teenager,

121
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,460
I'll be menopausal.

122
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,860
Where will I find the energy?

123
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,420
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

124
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,750
If you don't worry,

125
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,070
someone else will.

126
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,700
Who?

127
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,430
Your brother?

128
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,780
What does he worry about?

129
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,390
While others face midlife crises,

130
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,070
he's completely carefree.

131
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,710
He doesn't seem concerned at all.

132
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,830
The company hasn't collected its debts,

133
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,870
but he's not worried at all.

134
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,710
He's cheerful every day.

135
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,780
That means
it's not worth worrying about.

136
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,630
Besides life and death,

137
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,950
nothing else is a big deal.

138
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,190
Be happy.

139
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,190
Happy wife, happy life.

140
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,900
You're more and more like someone.

141
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,460
They say the best way

142
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,830
to remember someone

143
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,950
is to live like them.

144
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
Taichu,

145
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
make sure Grandpa

146
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,150
does these rehab exercises properly.

147
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,700
(Lying-side leg raises)

148
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Mom,

149
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,780
why didn't I inherit

150
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,830
your artistic talent?

151
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,220
Everyone has different gifts.

152
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,070
Aren't you like your dad?

153
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,830
Your logical thinking

154
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,340
and hands-on skills are great, right?

155
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,100
Look at the models you make.

156
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,630
They're fantastic.

157
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,790
Mom,

158
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,030
when I graduate,

159
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
you have to give me a big gift.

160
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,390
It's my birthday today,

161
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,510
and you didn't give me anything.

162
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,420
How can you ask for a gift?

163
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,750
I did give you something.

164
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,590
Didn't I play "Happy Birthday" for you?

165
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,900
For that simple tune,

166
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,340
you still messed up two notes.

167
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,270
I didn't mess up.

168
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,780
I was changing the key.

169
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,270
Sure. So tell me,

170
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
what gift do you want for that tune?

171
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,030
I haven't decided yet.

172
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,750
Just promise me first.

173
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,660
Asking for a gift for elementary school.

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,780
When you graduate from college,
you'll probably kill me.

175
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,420
Go to bed.

176
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,790
Good night.

177
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,500
Good night, Mom.

178
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,860
(Unknown number)

179
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
Hello.

180
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,900
Gengsheng, it's me.

181
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,660
Who?

182
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,230
Mr. Yuan, here's your coffee.

183
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,140
- Thanks.
- You're all here.

184
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,990
We need to work late tonight

185
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,150
to finalize this plan.

186
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
Hello?

187
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,940
I'll be home late tonight.

188
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,390
You pick up our son.

189
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,300
I need to pick him up?

190
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,780
Alright. You're working late.

191
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,300
Come home early.

192
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,150
Stay safe.

193
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,660
Okay.

194
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,350
My wife has to work late.

195
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,630
I have to pick up my son,

196
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,390
so I'll leave the plan to you, okay?

197
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,710
Go.

198
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,470
I'm leaving now.

199
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
Take care.

200
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,060
Did you review the financial report?

201
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,420
Yes.

202
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,180
Did you receive the dividends?

203
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,510
Already transferred to me.

204
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,350
What do you plan to do
with all that money?

205
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,270
I don't bother with such things.

206
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,230
You never seem to care

207
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,110
about making money.

208
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,390
Who says that?

209
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,060
I care a lot.

210
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,420
But I think money

211
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,390
is just an added value from work.

212
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,110
If you work properly,

213
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,420
money will come.

214
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,470
If you focus only on money,

215
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,630
nothing gets done, right?

216
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,070
Right.

217
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,420
Money is a bridge to the ultimate value,

218
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,750
but one can't live on the bridge.

219
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
That's something you taught me.

220
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,060
Did I ever tell you that?

221
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,110
Maybe not in words, but by example.

222
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,780
Hello?

223
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,700
You still owe me dinner.

224
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,870
I remember.

225
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,940
Tell me. What do you want to eat?

226
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,230
Anything.

227
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,030
I'll let you know after I decide.

228
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,780
Okay.

229
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

230
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,510
Table A05.

231
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,350
Right this way.

232
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,780
- Okay.
- Watch your step.

233
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,310
Here we are.

234
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,990
- Thank you.
- Sure.

235
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,740
Peng Songtao.

236
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,470
- You're here.
- Long time no see.

237
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,350
Yes.

238
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,350
You haven't changed a bit.

239
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,230
How could that be?

240
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,230
It's been so many years.

241
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,580
No need for these formalities.

242
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,510
No hug?

243
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,710
Have a seat.

244
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,260
How have you been?

245
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
Got a kid now?

246
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,300
I have a five-year-old son.

247
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,140
You?

248
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,870
No kids,

249
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,540
but I remarried

250
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,470
and divorced again.

251
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,380
Let's order first.

252
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,900
Then we can talk.

253
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
- Should I order?
- Sure.

254
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,150
After all these years,

255
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,750
I don't know
if your tastes have changed.

256
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,660
Alright, I'll take a look first.

257
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,380
Cheers.

258
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,510
I'm going to the restroom.

259
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,420
- Okay.
- Wait for me.

260
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,230
Actually, my taste

261
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,350
hasn't changed much over the years.

262
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,750
I can tell from the dishes.

263
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,180
This place has pretty good food.

264
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,870
How are you?

265
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,300
How's work been?

266
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,380
Good.

267
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,350
Pretty good, and you?

268
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,380
Not bad.

269
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,470
Just routine.

270
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,270
How long have you been back in Beijing?

271
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,940
Almost ten years.

272
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,380
That long?

273
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,030
Why didn't you let me know?

274
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,350
Would you have wanted to know?

275
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,990
Just joking.

276
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,350
I didn't think it was necessary.

277
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,230
You've become so humorous.

278
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,820
So?

279
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,470
Why tell me now?

280
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,260
Well,

281
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,750
I want to sell the apartment

282
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,270
we used to live in.

283
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,060
But the deed has both our names,

284
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,820
and you contributed to the purchase.

285
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,350
So, I need your opinion

286
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,300
before selling it.

287
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,230
I need to check with you.

288
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,270
I don't mind. It's your apartment.

289
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,540
Alright then.

290
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,300
I've agreed on the price with the buyer.

291
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,870
When it comes time to transfer the deed,

292
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,350
I'll need to bother you to come.

293
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,580
No need to say "bother".

294
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,420
We're past that.

295
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,070
Thanks.

296
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,820
Hello, here's the menu.

297
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,870
Thank you.

298
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,300
After living abroad for so many years,

299
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,150
aren't you tired of Western food?

300
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,500
One more meal won't hurt.

301
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,780
Just one more.

302
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,830
Hello.

303
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,470
Let's go with the pre-ordered menu.

304
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,870
Sure.

305
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,260
I did it for nothing.

306
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,270
Don't worry.
I ordered all your favorites.

307
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,470
Thanks.

308
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,350
You're welcome.

309
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,110
Enjoy.

310
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,350
Moules Marinières?

311
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,700
That takes too long.

312
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,270
We don't have enough time.

313
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,380
Let's have something simpler, okay?

314
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,500
Sandwiches?

315
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,380
Waitress.

316
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,940
Two sandwiches, please.

317
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,540
Still holding a grudge?

318
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,140
Of course.

319
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,030
Back then, we broke up

320
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,150
because you didn't get to eat this.

321
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,390
I'll never forget it.

322
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,140
Today,

323
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
I'm making it up to you.

324
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,300
You make it sound like I'm a foodie.

325
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,230
Cheers.

326
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,870
Come on.

327
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,830
Have a taste.

328
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,070
Thank you.

329
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,700
That year in Paris,

330
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
in haste,

331
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
I overlooked your feelings.

332
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,700
All these years,

333
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,540
I never had the chance
to treat you to this dish.

334
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,660
It's been a hurdle in my heart.

335
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,500
Today, I've done it.

336
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,750
I can finally turn the page.

337
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,780
Don't accuse me.

338
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,110
You didn't have a serious relationship.

339
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,030
That's not my fault.

340
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,510
Maybe it's because I'm older

341
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,990
that to love,

342
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,510
I've lost passion and impulse.

343
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,580
How old are you?

344
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,060
Why are you talking like an old man?

345
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,990
Life begins at forty.

346
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
Before that,

347
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,900
it's all research.

348
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,420
Your words aren't

349
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,630
to cheer yourself up
on your birthday, right?

350
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,270
I'm not saying this.

351
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,420
It's Jung who said it.

352
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,180
He lived to be eighty-six.

353
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,020
I'm telling you.

354
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,510
There are so many dating apps now.

355
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,780
Have you ever tried?

356
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,270
I registered a few

357
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,940
and got reported for being a scammer.

358
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,270
True.

359
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,030
Studied abroad,
an executive in a foreign firm,

360
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,300
single, loves sports.

361
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,820
No bad habits.

362
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,430
With your face,

363
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,420
you do look like one.

364
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,660
I'm being wronged.

365
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,510
Right?

366
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,820
Have you ever considered

367
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,300
you haven't met the right one

368
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,820
because you aren't ready for love?

369
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,750
I admit.

370
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
I used

371
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,670
to hold on to fantasies,

372
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,540
thinking we could get back together.

373
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,300
Now I understand

374
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,820
the difference between us.

375
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,750
Here.

376
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,030
Remember that movie?

377
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,750
"Midnight in Paris".

378
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,820
I think you're like

379
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,190
the girl Scarlett played.

380
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,860
Fearless

381
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,700
in love,

382
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,750
and curious.

383
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,100
You grow in every relationship.

384
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,550
When it ends,

385
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,060
you become a new Huang Yimei

386
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,380
and start a new relationship.

387
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,470
As for me,

388
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,510
I'm more like

389
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,230
Rebecca Hall.

390
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,030
A bit old-fashioned,

391
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,710
but once I set a goal,

392
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,030
I'm not swayed by anything else.

393
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,620
So, no matter how old I get,

394
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,060
no matter how many achievements,

395
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,860
in love, I'm still like a child,

396
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,510
crying, making a fuss,

397
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,710
wanting back

398
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,990
a toy that's already lost.

399
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,340
To persist in love is love.

400
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,990
To love for persistence

401
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,780
is to be obsessive.

402
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,590
Incisive.

403
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,860
So I've figured it out.

404
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm ready.

405
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,860
I can't be this immature anymore.

406
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,270
I need to approach love

407
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,380
like an adult now.

408
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,470
Good luck to you.

409
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,940
Thank you.

410
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,060
- Mr. Zhou, hello.
- Finished?

411
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,070
Here.

412
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,580
It took you so long
to pick up the takeout.

413
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,430
I'm starving.

414
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,750
I'm full. Take your time.

415
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,580
Did you

416
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,780
pick up your son yesterday?

417
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,180
Yes.

418
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,510
Ms. Su

419
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,060
was working overtime, right?

420
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,190
Right.

421
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,620
It was past nine when she got home.

422
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,070
What's wrong?

423
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,860
What do you want to say?

424
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,820
Nothing.

425
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,270
If there's something, just say it.

426
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,540
Last night,

427
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,340
it seems like...

428
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,030
It seems like

429
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,580
I saw Ms. Su.

430
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,510
Unlikely.
She was working at the company.

431
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,540
Did you go to her company?

432
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,030
In a mall, at a restaurant.

433
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,230
She was having dinner with a man.

434
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Are you mistaken?

435
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,670
I'm not sure.

436
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,190
I didn't get a good look at it.

437
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,990
Look, is this her?

438
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
This is her.

439
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,540
Meeting a client.

440
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,270
Half of her current job is socializing.

441
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,420
That's good.

442
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,430
It's good to keep busy.

443
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,860
Didn't you work overtime yesterday

444
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,340
and finalize that plan?

445
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,710
Why did you go for dinner?

446
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,860
Yes, our plan went smoothly.

447
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,060
Then I went with the client.

448
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,990
Back so late.

449
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,110
Overtime at the company.

450
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,180
Had dinner?

451
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,750
Yes.

452
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,910
This is the master bedroom.

453
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,270
Over here,

454
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,350
there's also a study.

455
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,350
In these past two years,

456
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,860
the company's business
has shifted to Beijing.

457
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,670
I've been spending more time here.

458
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,380
Staying in hotels

459
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,580
isn't very convenient.

460
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,030
With this house,

461
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
I finally have a home in Beijing.

462
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,750
Isn't your company
in the development zone?

463
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,510
Living so far away,

464
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,950
isn't it less convenient
than staying in a hotel?

465
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,670
But at least,

466
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,790
it's closer to you two.

467
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,540
Right, let me show you Taichu's room.

468
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,550
Come.

469
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,550
Come.

470
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,710
This room is Taichu's.

471
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,380
She likes yellow, right?

472
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,980
I picked a few things.

473
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,990
This room faces southeast.

474
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,230
Luck comes from the East.

475
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,460
Good for studying.

476
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,790
Do you like it?

477
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,300
Taichu will love it.

478
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,190
She loves reading near the window.

479
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,830
Here's a set of keys.

480
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,750
Give them to her yourself.

481
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,220
Don't get me wrong.

482
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,430
I'm not trying to fight for custody.

483
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,780
If Taichu wants to stay,

484
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,190
she can stay as long as she likes.

485
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,780
If she doesn't want to stay,

486
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,580
I won't force her.

487
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,140
Taichu has grown up now.

488
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,860
Whoever gets the custody is up to her.

489
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,540
Not necessary, Fang.

490
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,420
Alright.

491
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,710
This location is quite good,

492
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,470
and it's close to Taichu's school.

493
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,470
When she's here with you,

494
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,540
you can help her with her studies,

495
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,950
like math and physics.

496
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,430
In another two years, I can't teach her.

497
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
I'll tutor her?

498
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,100
Looks like I'll need

499
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,950
to brush up on my studies as well.

500
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,310
But we don't need

501
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,300
to worry too much about her grades.

502
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,750
If worst comes to worst,
I'll send her abroad.

503
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,230
Don't you hate returnees the most?

504
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,270
Well,

505
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,300
I just

506
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,750
hate that one.

507
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,140
Mom, Mom!

508
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,300
How is my drawing?

509
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,510
Very nice.

510
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,470
What's on top? Are those clouds?

511
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,750
This is a super large nut.

512
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,870
Everyone's back.

513
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
- Dad, you're back.
- Why are you...

514
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,750
Why are you so early today?

515
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,710
It's not busy, so I came home.

516
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,780
Your son wants fries.

517
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,540
I'm ordering takeaways.
What do you want?

518
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,540
Just get me a burger.

519
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,430
No overtime today? Just yesterday?

520
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,430
I can't work overtime every day.

521
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,990
True. Or who would've picked up our son?

522
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,910
Why did you work overtime yesterday?

523
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,550
To finalize a contract.

524
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,750
You stayed at the company?

525
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,380
What's wrong?

526
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,750
Nothing.

527
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,030
Dad, how's my drawing?

528
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,230
You've drawn really well.

529
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,030
What's that thing
on top of the dinosaur's head?

530
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,660
This?

531
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,190
It's a nut
and a future bullet train city.

532
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,430
It's a future bullet train city,

533
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,710
and it's battling with it.

534
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,820
This is its cannon,

535
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,230
and this side is its launcher.

536
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,470
What's wrong? Why the long face?

537
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,580
What's so great about it?

538
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,030
Who are you upset with?

539
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,860
Qiao Ziyu from our model group.

540
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,620
His dad took him
to a simulated cockpit once,

541
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,030
and now he's been bragging non-stop.

542
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,990
Saying we haven't seen the world.

543
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,430
Why didn't you tell him

544
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,780
you've been flying
between Shanghai and Beijing

545
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,340
since you were little?

546
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
I did,

547
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,790
but he said

548
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,860
flying and piloting
aren't the same thing.

549
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,030
The buttons and screens in the cockpit

550
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,640
are like something
out of a sci-fi movie.

551
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,070
Mom,

552
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,780
I want to try a simulated cockpit too.

553
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,230
Is there one in Beijing?

554
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,350
Yes.

555
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,140
Qiao Ziyu's dad took him to one
in Pinggu.

556
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,510
How much is it?

557
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,670
1,999 yuan.

558
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
That's so expensive.

559
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,940
Forget it.

560
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,950
I'll download a flight game

561
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,510
from the app store.

562
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,710
You promised me a graduation gift.

563
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I want this.

564
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,580
But I didn't promise you

565
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,540
I'd get you a gift worth 2,000 yuan.

566
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,190
It's less than 2,000.

567
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,230
1,999 yuan.

568
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,620
Too much for the budget.

569
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,660
How about this?

570
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I'll give you 1,000.

571
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,910
The rest will be deducted
from your New Year's money.

572
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,780
I already bought a switch with that.

573
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,190
Then earn it yourself.

574
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,780
I reward you

575
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,030
for doing chores, don't I?

576
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,340
Wiping the table earns me only 1 yuan.

577
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,670
I won't make 1,000 through that.

578
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,300
It's less than 1,000.

579
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,270
999 yuan.

580
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,750
Ms. Huang.

581
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,060
- Welcome.
- Okay.

582
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,620
Please come over here.

583
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,940
This way, please.

584
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,510
- You can take a look at this.
- Okay.

585
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,540
This is an introduction
to our simulated cockpit.

586
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,380
Okay.

587
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,190
The experience in our base

588
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,230
is very realistic.

589
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,750
The seats rotate in all directions.

590
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,230
We can also simulate the takeoff height

591
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,620
and turning of the aircraft.

592
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,340
Can these planes actually fly?

593
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,270
Yes, we have many models.

594
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,540
Small fixed-wing aircraft.

595
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,710
Two-seaters like the SA60L,

596
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,340
and a Cirrus SR20.

597
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,820
Every year, many students come here

598
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,820
to get their pilot's license.

599
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,750
We also have flight experience courses.

600
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,750
Why use a simulated cockpit
if you have real planes?

601
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,950
What's the cost
of this flight experience?

602
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,620
1,999 yuan for ten minutes,

603
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,340
2,999 yuan for half an hour,

604
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,710
and for one hour...

605
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,950
I want one hour.

606
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,870
Can I do it now?

607
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,470
Let me check
if we have a coach available now.

608
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,380
- Okay.
- Please wait a moment.

609
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,060
Only 1,000 budget for me,

610
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,990
but you are spending money on yourself.

611
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,190
I earned it. Talk less.

612
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,030
I'll transfer

613
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,140
the money to you via online banking.

614
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,470
If you're worried,

615
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,510
(Real Estate Registration Affairs Center)
I'll write you an IOU.

616
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,710
Worried about what?

617
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,580
Didn't you give me back
when we got divorced?

618
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,430
I'll have nothing to say if you don't.

619
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,950
How can the housing prices back then

620
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,190
be compared to the prices now?

621
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,430
So I'm expecting it now.

622
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,300
I'm happy.

623
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,580
We can still be friends.

624
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,510
Just like when we were kids.

625
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,340
Childhood buddies.

626
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,580
May I ask
why do you need to sell the house?

627
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,990
Of course, you may.

628
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,140
I've been doing some investments.

629
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,350
What investments?

630
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,760
Investments in various fields.

631
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,380
They say not to put all your eggs
in one basket.

632
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,060
Right, in your industry,

633
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,590
are there
any good investment opportunities?

634
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,380
Art collecting.

635
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,380
Set the famous masters' works aside.

636
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,100
I can't come up with
that much capital at once,

637
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,670
but I've heard some painters' works

638
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,300
are quite cheap
before they became famous.

639
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,670
After becoming famous,
they can increase by hundreds of times.

640
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,990
Is there such an opportunity?

641
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,470
That depends on luck.

642
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,100
And appreciation is very personal.

643
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,910
It still tests artistic taste.

644
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,380
Yeah.

645
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,580
So I plan to humbly learn

646
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,190
- from my childhood buddy.
- No, no.

647
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,230
Don't flatter me.

648
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,180
Get in the car.

649
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,180
Ms. Huang,

650
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,620
this is

651
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,620
your flight instructor today, He Xi.

652
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

653
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,270
He Xi?

654
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,030
Are your parents Sanmao's fans?

655
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,340
Are you referring to an animation?

656
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,790
Forget it.

657
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,300
This is for you, right?

658
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,540
Okay, I'll help you with your things.

659
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,820
Mr. He, I'll leave it to you.

660
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,700
- Follow me.
- Okay.

661
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,300
This is the plane we'll be flying today.

662
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,670
It's a normal four-seat Cirrus aircraft

663
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,710
equipped with a whole-plane parachute,

664
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,950
known as the BMW of the sky.

665
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,750
Before the flight later,

666
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,510
I'll conduct
a standard pre-flight check.

667
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,580
- Please wait here for a moment.
- Okay.

668
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,190
Alright, follow me.

669
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,310
Before takeoff,

670
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,580
I'll teach you how to board the plane.

671
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,030
Hold the handrail before boarding,

672
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,350
step on the footstep before entering,

673
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,310
and step on the anti-slip mat.

674
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,590
Like this.

675
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,780
- Slow down.
- Please sign here.

676
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,620
Okay.

677
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,940
The adult goes first.

678
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,140
Sit in the back to balance the cargo.

679
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,310
Okay.

680
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,270
Okay, now you can fasten your seat belts

681
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,380
and put on your headphones.

682
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,310
Are you ready?

683
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,750
Let's take off.

684
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,060
9771, all checks done.
Requesting permission to start.

685
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,750
Permission granted, 9771.

686
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,860
9771, requesting permission to taxi.

687
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,230
9771, permission granted.

688
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,710
Please wait at Track B.

689
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,670
Mom, I'm so excited!

690
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,510
Get ready.

691
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,990
Experience a steep turn.

692
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,910
Let's do it again!

693
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,990
No, no, no.

694
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,030
No, no, no.

695
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,870
Here's the control stick.

696
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,140
Turn left to fly left.

697
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,180
Turn right to fly right.

698
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,060
Pull back to climb.

699
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,380
Come on, feel it.

700
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,900
Mom!

701
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,260
This is so much fun!

702
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,510
I told you, right?

703
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,790
Mom, did you take a picture of me?

704
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,510
Of course.
Is it more fun than the simulator?

705
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,740
Of course, what a crappy simulator.

706
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,220
- I told you, right?
- Boring.

707
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,270
Slow down.

708
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,030
- The simulator is not as fun as a real plane.
- Come on.

709
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,100
Slow down.

710
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,180
If it's about showing off,

711
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,540
a real plane is definitely cooler.

712
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,430
But the simulator has its uses.

713
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,540
It's not that crappy.

714
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,140
It's like racing games in arcades.

715
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,510
Much worse than real planes.

716
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,540
That's the first generation.

717
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,100
The second generation
added a lot of features,

718
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,330
and the experience is more realistic.

719
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,350
But I haven't finished designing yet.

720
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
You designed it?

721
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,900
How did you design it?

722
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,310
Can I see it?

723
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,030
Can you understand
the drawings at your age?

724
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,830
I can.

725
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,310
I even made a model

726
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,790
of such a big plane
based on the drawings.

727
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,910
That's a model.

728
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,100
A simulator is different.

729
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,660
You'd better get into university first.

730
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,300
(Honey)

731
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,180
No need to finish it.

732
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,230
Bye.

733
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,540
That's Mom. Mom!

734
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,420
Ms. Su.

735
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,100
Dad, slow down.

736
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,100
Mom hasn't gotten in the car yet.

737
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,790
She hasn't finished work yet.

738
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,860
I'll come back later to pick her up.

739
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm back.

740
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,950
Mom, you're back.

741
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,140
Why eat these again?

742
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,580
Didn't you eat them a couple of days ago?

743
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,910
Dad took me to buy hamburgers and fries.

744
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,750
Without waiting for you.

745
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,510
Why didn't you wait for me?

746
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,030
Because you had to work.

747
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,100
We saw you go in.

748
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,270
We went to pick you up.

749
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,430
I can eat it again.

750
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,430
I saw you get off someone else's car

751
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,630
and go back to the company.

752
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,350
Pudding,

753
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,870
eat less fries.

754
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,220
Drink more milk.

755
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,580
Got it.

756
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,580
Get some nutrition.

757
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,790
Is he a colleague?

758
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,060
Who is it?

759
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,580
Peng Songtao.

760
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,940
Peng...

761
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,060
He's asleep?

762
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,700
Seems happy
after meeting your ex-husband.

763
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,580
Feeling jealous?

764
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,510
Why should I be jealous?

765
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,790
I'm just curious.

766
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,060
Didn't he move abroad?

767
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,910
Haven't you been out of touch?

768
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,310
He has a house under both our names.

769
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,870
Now he wants to sell it.

770
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,510
We went to transfer ownership today.

771
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,350
You two bought a house together?

772
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,350
It was a welfare house from work.

773
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,510
It was supposed to cost 100,000 yuan.

774
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,390
He didn't have it.

775
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,470
I helped with 20,000.

776
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,950
He paid me back when we divorced.

777
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,580
But he was in a rush to leave China,

778
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,620
so we didn't transfer it.

779
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,990
20,000 yuan
was not a small sum back then.

780
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Right.

781
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,910
So, he'll give me more from this sale.

782
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,540
You know why I'm happy?

783
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,220
Because there's money.

784
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,180
Of course.

785
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,790
Should have said so earlier.

786
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,350
You've even met him.

787
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,620
Why not invite him to dinner together?

788
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,620
Whether he's your ex or not,

789
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,540
he's been your friend since childhood.

790
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,670
Isn't it normal for me

791
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,950
to invite your friend to dinner and chat?

792
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,580
There's a chance.

793
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,350
I'm taking him
to an art gallery in a few days.

794
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,510
- Are you going?
- You'll still meet him?

795
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,990
He wants to invest in art pieces.

796
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,430
He wants my advice.

797
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,580
Are you going or not?

798
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,430
Just asking once. Are you going or not?

799
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,830
Yes. Why wouldn't I go?

800
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,030
I can learn something too.

801
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,870
Go.

802
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,620
It's been over ten years
since the divorce.

803
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,260
Do you believe
the house wasn't transferred?

804
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,790
Zhenhua,

805
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,180
that just proves

806
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,950
there's no dispute between them.

807
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,300
Right?

808
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,310
If people really fell out,

809
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
they'd have split socks,

810
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,260
let alone a house.

811
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,430
Besides, they've done

812
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,830
with the house, right?

813
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,540
They wouldn't be in touch.

814
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,380
That's okay.

815
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,220
I thought so.

816
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,350
He's inviting Su
to see an art exhibition,

817
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,100
as he wants
to learn about art investments.

818
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,830
Your mindset

819
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,700
and outlook

820
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,950
need to open up.

821
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,430
After a divorce,
they can still be friends.

822
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,540
It proves there are no lingering issues.

823
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,100
I'm not that magnanimous.

824
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,310
What did I say wrong?

825
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,310
When Su wanted to buy a one-bedroom flat,

826
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,740
she refused to use my money.

827
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,310
Never thought she bought a house
with someone else.

828
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,350
I thought I was her most trusted person.

829
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,580
You're exhausting yourself

830
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,390
by studying her past.

831
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,710
Why bother?

832
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,620
Why force yourself to find a rival?

833
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,470
What could this person have

834
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,350
that would make you jealous?

835
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,460
Money?

836
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,630
He doesn't have more than you.

837
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,870
Looks?

838
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,940
He's not better-looking than you.

839
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,150
His face

840
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,870
is much longer than yours.

841
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,500
Like a horse.

842
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,390
He's worse than me, right?

843
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,310
Way worse.

844
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,100
Breaking up showed
they weren't compatible?

845
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,990
They weren't harmonious in any way.

846
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,030
Su chose me because I'm better than him.

847
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,100
You're too good.

848
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,870
- Really?
- Have a little confidence, okay?

849
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,950
Just going to an art exhibition, right?

850
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,020
