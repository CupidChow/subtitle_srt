3
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,100
You run.

4
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,820
You should know how marathons began.

5
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,590
One person ran 42.195 kilometers

6
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,670
just to deliver a message.

7
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,030
I have a message too.

8
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,460
You run a marathon with me,

9
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,740
and I'll tell you.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,990
Come on.

11
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,620
You're panting after five kilometers.

12
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,230
Don't you know about your own strength?

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,340
Don't worry about this.

14
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,790
Just tell me if you'll join me.

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,340
Are you sure?

16
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,060
A full marathon?

17
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,030
Forty-two kilometers.

18
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,830
Yes, I'm sure.

19
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,830
Almost six kilometers done.

20
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,430
Less than 37 kilometers to go.

21
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,340
Is this nail polish easy to remove?

22
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,430
Yes, it is.

23
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,660
Why are you thinking about removing it
before it finishes?

24
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,270
I just interviewed at an international school.

25
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,540
I think I have a good chance.

26
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,780
I wonder if they have any requirements

27
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,030
for makeup or attire.

28
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,420
Wait until you get the offer.

29
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,300
Don't limit yourself

30
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,950
before they do.

31
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,140
Okay.

32
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,990
Ms. Jiang,

33
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,830
what are your future plans?

34
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,910
Opening an art gallery.

35
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,860
Then I'll be your first audience.

36
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,030
Do you only want to be an audience?

37
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,820
Twenty-eight.

38
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,870
Twenty-eight.

39
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,830
How is it? Show me.

40
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,030
So beautiful.

41
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,180
Look.

42
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,860
As long as you are meticulous,

43
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,420
nail polish can be an art form.

44
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Yes, grooming is also a form of creation.

45
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,860
Living is creating.

46
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,220
Each day is a new beginning.

47
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,630
Most people live like products
on an assembly line.

48
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,150
Only a few live like works of art.

49
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,030
How to distinguish them?

50
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,300
First,

51
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,390
you must hold the carving knife

52
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,460
in your own hands.

53
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,990
Huang Zhenhua.

54
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,230
Huang Zhenhua.

55
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,780
We've finished running

56
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,590
and I've taken you home.

57
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,660
Can I have your message now?

58
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Su,

59
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,030
how about

60
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,590
we go to Phuket for our honeymoon?

61
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,220
What do you think?

62
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,070
Or you suggest a place.

63
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,590
You dragged me around all day.

64
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,630
Wasn't it for a breakup ceremony?

65
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,350
Breaking up will be too easy on you.

66
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,900
I wanted to punish you.

67
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,820
Punish me?

68
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,540
You were married.

69
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,110
It happened before we met.

70
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,420
It's your past, not a mistake.

71
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,060
It could have been resolved in one go,

72
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,350
but you hid it from me.

73
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,630
That was wrong.

74
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,870
I felt unbalanced,

75
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,990
so I punished you with this marathon.

76
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,350
Now it's over,

77
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,990
and I've punished you.

78
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
It's fine now.

79
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,230
Come on.

80
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,110
Were you punishing me or yourself?

81
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,660
You hurt yourself far worse than it did to me.

82
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,230
You wouldn't get out of bed

83
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,580
for a week.

84
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,470
So what?

85
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,070
At worst,

86
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,580
you can still rent a wheelchair

87
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,230
and push me around every day.

88
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,230
Honestly,

89
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,540
I never thought I could run...

90
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,510
Oh, walk this 42 kilometers.

91
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,660
Not even halfway,

92
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,300
and I felt like my soul was leaving my body.

93
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,180
Countless times I wanted to give up

94
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,300
and just lay down right there.

95
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,110
But

96
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,540
every time

97
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,750
I turned around,

98
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,300
I saw you beside me.

99
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,990
I felt

100
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
I could keep going

101
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,110
a bit longer and run a bit more.

102
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,180
When I couldn't take it anymore,

103
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,350
I'd turn and look at you,

104
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,780
so I could keep going a bit longer.

105
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,060
I can't explain

106
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,420
if it was for you or because of you

107
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,900
that I made it to the end.

108
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,270
I feel

109
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,140
one's

110
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,750
whole life

111
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,870
is long.

112
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,900
If I

113
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,820
have you as a companion,

114
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,350
couldn't we,

115
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,060
like today's marathon,

116
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,060
see all the scenery,

117
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,350
taste all the food along the way,

118
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,470
and make it to the end?

119
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,700
What do you think?

120
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,780
Say something.

121
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,390
Let's

122
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,270
give it a try.

123
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,230
So, you agree?

124
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,420
Let me rest for a bit.

125
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,780
Let me rest for a bit.

127
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,820
we can't always exercise?

128
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,030
What was that you said earlier?

129
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,150
I hurt myself what?

130
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,780
You hurt yourself far worse

131
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,780
than it did to me.

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,150

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,700

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,230
so she can't notify you in person.

195
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,060
That's the situation.

196
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,580
We've solved everything.

197
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,540
Don't try to persuade me.

198
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
I'm going to marry her.

199
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,140
Don't be self-centered.

200
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,310
No one's persuading you.

201
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
That must've been hard on Su.

202
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,470
I feel sorry for her.

203
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,780
But son,

204
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,470
have you thought it through?

205
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,350
Mom,

206
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,470
nobody is perfect.

207
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,060
I have my flaws too.

208
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,620
I'm marrying her,

209
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,300
not aiming for a perfect score.

210
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,550
Being realistic.

211
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,940
If we try hard,

212
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,340
we can get over 80, right?

213
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,230
What perfect score? What 80?

214
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,860
My brother means

215
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,140
to treat the marriage like a test.

216
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,270
Many couples

217
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,230
are lovey-dovey at the start

218
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,780
but fighting after a few years.

219
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,180
Dad, Mom,

220
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,100
how many points would you give your marriage?

221
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,870
Us?

222
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,670
- 120.
- 85.

223
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,820
Why 120 points?

224
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,710
They each

225
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,670
gave it an extra ten points.

226
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,060
Good for you.

227
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,750
There's even a bonus question.

228
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,790
Yes.

229
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,620
Sit down on the chair for a while.

230
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,380
Come on.

231
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,140
Here.

232
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,550
Take a look yourself.

233
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Thank you for coming back for me.

234
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,300
I came back for my brother.

235
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,300
I was afraid he'd be a bachelor for life.

236
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,540
Why are you leaving so soon?

237
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,380
Won't you stay for a meal after we get married?

238
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,230
Taichu's kindergarten is starting soon.

239
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,510
I need to prepare.

240
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,430
Fang has been busy with company mergers,

241
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,380
working day and night.

242
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,910
I have to go back early too.

243
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,030
Should one submit a paper early

244
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,670
that's doomed to fail?

245
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,470
I know he's worked hard,

246
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,340
taking care of the family,

247
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,100
and providing a comfortable life for us.

248
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,780
But I just feel

249
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,230
more and more suffocated.

250
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,670
When did it start?

251
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,300
Maybe we were never meant to be together.

252
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,580
Ladies and gentlemen,

253
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,990
the flight from Beijing to Shanghai

254
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,140
is about to take off.

255
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,750
Please take your luggage

256
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,380
and proceed to Gate 3.

257
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,340
It's late. I must go.

258
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,380
Thank you for your cooperation.

259
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,980
Come on.

260
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,830
Let's go.

261
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,830
We can look at it later.

262
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,750
Come on.

263
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,830
Come.

264
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,750
Take our luggage.

265
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,430
Do you want to say bye-bye to Auntie?

266
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,780
Goodbye, Auntie.

267
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,540
Goodbye. Let me hug you.

268
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,380
I'll miss you. Will you miss me?

269
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,670
I'll bring you something delicious
when I'm in Shanghai, okay?

270
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,870
Pinky promise.

271
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Seal it with a stamp.

272
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,510
Off you go.

273
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,060
Keep in touch.

274
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,830
Congratulations on your wedding.

275
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,030
Daddy!

276
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,700
Taichu.

277
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,470
I missed you so much.

278
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,070
Taichu,

279
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,510
did you have fun in Beijing?

280
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Yes.

281
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,470
Where did you go?

282
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,270
A small park and a big park.

283
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,580
Who took you there?

284
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,340
Grandma and Grandpa.

285
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,340
Didn't Mommy go with you?

286
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,820
Mommy let me go with Grandma and Grandpa.

287
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,670
Taichu, look.

288
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,140
I bought your favorite cake.

289
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,980
Do you want to eat it?

290
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,950
Yes.

291
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,780
Then be a good girl and go wash your hands.

292
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,190
- Okay?
- Okay.

293
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,070
Go ahead.

294
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,620
If you have any questions, ask me directly.

295
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,270
Why fish for that from the child?

296
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,510
I'm concerned about both of you.

297
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,670
How is that fishing?

298
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,540
Besides, you've taught her how to answer

299
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,990
about the things you don't want me to know,

300
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,140
right?

301
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,060
Do you think I would teach the child to lie?

302
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,950
Fang Xiewen,

303
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,190
what are you thinking about all day?

304
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,230
Did you get your nails done?

305
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,270
Why?

306
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,140
I like it.

307
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,230
Daddy, I washed my hands.

308
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,750
I want to eat the cake.

309
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,070
Alright.

310
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,100
Taichu, sit down.

311
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,270
I will give you some cake. Here.

312
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,950
Is it your favorite?

313
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,990
Then sit still.

314
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,870
Taichu.

315
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,030
(Inbox)

316
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,100
Do you still want to ride a big horse?

317
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,820
Then sit tight.

318
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
Why is it ringing?

319
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,030
Someone's calling you.

320
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,430
Daddy, you're getting a shot.

321
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,270
A shot?

322
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
- Give me a shot.
- Taichu.

323
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,710
Time to sleep.

324
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,350
Come.

325
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,180
Taichu, tonight,

326
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,030
do you want to sleep with Mommy and Daddy?

327
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,460
Yes.

328
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,820
She can sleep by herself.

329
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,350
Taichu,

330
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,140
do you want Daddy to tell you a story?

331
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,270
Yes.

332
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,340
I want to hear the story
of Little Red Riding Hood.

333
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,060
Then ask Mommy to come and sleep with us.

334
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,790
Okay.

335
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,990
Mommy,

336
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,710
let's sleep with Dad.

337
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,620
Okay?

338
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,550
Get into the blanket.

339
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,780
Under the blanket.

340
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,910
Little Red Riding Hood.

341
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,620
Let me tell you the story
of Little Red Riding Hood.

342
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,470
Once upon a time,

343
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,750
there was a lovely little girl.

344
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,580
She liked to wear a red velvet cap

345
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,510
her grandmother gave her.

346
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,620
So everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.

347
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,990
One day,

348
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,670
her mother asked her to bring food

349
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,100
to her grandmother who lived in the forest

350
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,430
and reminded her

351
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,030
not to stray from the path.

352
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,300
In the forest, Little Red Riding Hood
met the big bad wolf.

353
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,310
Are you still angry?

354
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,620
You can't avoid me every night.

355
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,100
I don't want a second child.

356
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,740
(Home)

357
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,550
Come in.

358
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,510
Don't worry.

359
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,860
I'm not here to argue.

360
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,420
Sit down.

361
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,750
There's nothing left to argue about.

362
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,950
The merger with Tianlangxing

363
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,790
is decided.

364
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,070
Fang,

365
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,270
I've decided to leave.

366
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,870
You were right.

367
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,510
You control this company,

368
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,140
so I must go.

369
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,230
After the contract is signed,

370
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,990
I'll buy

371
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,030
all your shares back

372
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,470
at Tianlangxing's valuation.

373
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,380
If you're not assured,

374
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,860
we can draft an agreement first.

375
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,710
No need. I trust you.

376
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,790
Fang,

377
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,190
you can buy my shares,

378
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,380
but

379
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,140
don't buy out our friendship.

380
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,620
Is that okay?

381
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,980
I can't afford it.

382
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,030
We'll have chances to work together

383
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,750
in the future, right?

384
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,870
I'm leaving.

385
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,700
Lin Hao.

386
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,190
I just want to know.

387
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,670
Isn't it good to have money?

388
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,860
I don't understand

389
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,910
why you always want to take risks.

390
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,950
Can't you just enjoy

391
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,780
the pleasure of being rich?

392
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
Maybe it is

393
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,670
about finding my own limits.

394
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,420
Yes.

395
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,990
Being rich is impressive to others,

396
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,270
but I feel

397
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,340
I can do things greater than making money.

398
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,540
See you, Fang.

399
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,590
Come in.

400
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,870
Tina.

401
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,990
Why are you here?

402
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,060
You got married in the morning
and came to work in the afternoon.

403
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,620
Squeezing in a wedding like this.

404
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,350
Here.

405
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,060
- Congratulations on your wedding.
- Thank you.

406
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,940
Sit down.

407
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,540
How are you?

408
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,540
This place looks the same as before.

409
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,380
Not much has changed.

410
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,380
I'm nostalgic.

411
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,860
But I don't have alcohol here.

412
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,820
I can see that. The liquor cabinet is gone.

413
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,140
Huang Yimei went back to Shanghai?

414
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,460
She left yesterday.

415
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,510
In such a hurry?

416
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,870
That day,

417
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,510
I told her about my plan

418
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,780
to open an art gallery.

419
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,470
I wanted to have a good talk with her.

420
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,620
Both of us were trained by you.

421
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,140
Why didn't you ask me about it?

422
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,510
Ms. Su,

423
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,470
isn't this large office enough for you?

424
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,830
You're not suited

425
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,100
for entrepreneurship.

426
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,140
I don't care. I'm just jealous.

427
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,300
Why is she suited and not me?

428
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,540
You're an experienced captain.

429
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,380
You won't veer off course.

430
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,580
Handing a ship to you is the safest.

431
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,820
But what I'm doing now

432
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,750
has no set course.

433
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,950
I might discover a new world

434
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,950
or hit a reef and sink.

435
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,310
So,

436
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,430
only Huang Yimei can take this risk with me.

437
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,750
When I saw her off yesterday,

438
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,190
I felt her life wasn't comfortable.

439
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,620
Very oppressive.

440
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,380
Yes.

441
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,310
That day

442
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,750
when we did our nails together, I felt it too.

443
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,580
So she needs this adventure more now.

444
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,580
But now she has a child.

445
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,030
I'm not sure if she can still

446
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,510
be as free as before.

447
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,510
Ms. Sun, your document

448
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,780
is very well done.

449
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,860
Let's end our conversation here today.

450
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,900
Please come in.

451
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,140
Hello,

452
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,910
I'm the one who got interviewed last time.

453
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,950
Huang Yimei, right?

454
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,100
- Yes, yes.
- Come in, come in.

455
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,460
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

456
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,060
How are you? Feeling better?

457
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,350
Not too bad.

458
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,380
You still remember me.

459
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,750
Of course.

460
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,910
The school management discussed

461
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,580
the art therapy proposal you made.

462
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,620
It's very feasible.

463
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
That's great.

464
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,620
Sorry to disturb you so suddenly.

465
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,540
It's a little abrupt,

466
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,860
but I need to ask something.

467
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,510
It's been two weeks,

468
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,950
and I haven't received the interview result.

469
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,060
I wanted to know

470
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,580
if there was something I lacked.

471
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,790
You already passed the interview.

472
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,790
No one notified me.

473
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,660
We sent you an email

474
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,740
asking for background check contacts.

475
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,700
Didn't you reply saying you couldn't join us?

476
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,830
I replied?

477
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,670
Yes.

478
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,630
The HR Department said

479
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,620
your husband even called to confirm.

480
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,510
We felt it was a pity,

481
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,030
but we had no choice.

482
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,060
The offer was given to another candidate.

483
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,660
You shouldn't do your nails while pregnant.

484
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,830
Better safe than sorry,

485
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,190
right?

486
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,660
My husband said I was pregnant?

487
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,540
Thank you.

488
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,460
Hello?

489
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,900
Hello?

490
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,350
Don't work late today.

491
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,430
Come home early.

492
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,390
Is something wrong?

493
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,260
I'll wait for you at home.

494
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,060
Alright.

495
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,580
(Jiaxiang International Middle School)

496
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,380
Where's Taichu?

497
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,350
At Yue's house.

498
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,030
Her mom agreed to look after her for a while.

499
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,350
Why?

500
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,870
I have something to tell you.

501
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,870
Go ahead.

502
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,430
I want a divorce.

503
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,980
Tell me.

504
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,380
Who did you see

505
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,870
in Beijing?

506
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,830
Why are you laughing?

507
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,100
Does there have to be an external reason?

508
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,580
There must be some reason.

509
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
I don't love you anymore.

510
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,870
You don't love me? That's it?

511
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,140
With such a lousy reason,

512
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,870
you want a divorce?

513
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,260
Who's still madly in love

514
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,390
after years of marriage?

515
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,910
Isn't it just living day to day?

516
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,270
Huang Yimei,

517
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,830
I've treated you well,

518
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,350
maybe not as pampered

519
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,220
as before,

520
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,910
so you just stopped loving me?

521
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,060
Isn't it ridiculous?

522
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,390
I can't give you a son,

523
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,950
and you can't give me trust and respect.

524
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,740
We are from two different worlds.

525
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,060
Why force it?

526
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,830
What do you mean?

527
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,870
How about the child?

528
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,740
What about Taichu?

529
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,020
Have you thought about that?

530
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,830
That's exactly why

531
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,430
I must divorce you.

532
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,740
What kind of family is this?

533
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,310
For her mental health...

534
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,220
Shut up.

535
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,750
Huang Yimei,

536
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,540
I'm telling you.

537
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,350
Your decision alone

538
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,100
means nothing.

539
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,140
You're not going anywhere,

540
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,380
unless

541
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,870
you never want to see the child again.

542
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,910
This is my first time asking for a divorce.

543
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,660
I understand

544
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
you're angry

545
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
and find it hard to accept.

546
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,020
But Fang,

547
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,950
you're still my husband now.

548
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,830
I hope we can resolve this peacefully.

549
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,660
If you can't, that's okay.

550
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,350
I'll file for divorce.

551
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,230
In six months

552
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,710
to a year,

553
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,060
it'll be over.

554
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,830
I will definitely fight for Taichu's custody.

555
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,510
I know

556
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,790
you rejected

557
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,230
the school job.

558
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,870
I also know you installed

559
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,030
a tracking app on my phone.

560
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm going to pick up the child.

561
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,870
Take your time to think it over.

562
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,260
We'll talk again in a few days.

563
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
Daddy.

564
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,540
Daddy.

565
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,990
Why is Daddy upset?

566
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,220
Is he mad at me?

567
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,750
Of course not.

568
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,870
He is just distracted.

569
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,620
Our team's efficient collaboration

570
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,910
ensured the project was completed on time.

571
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,430
Comprehensive testing and optimization
