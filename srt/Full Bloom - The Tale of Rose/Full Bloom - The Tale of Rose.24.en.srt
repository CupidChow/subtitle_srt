00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,710
By the way, Dad, Mom,

4
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,030
how about

5
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,340
I drive you around tomorrow?

6
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,260
You can see the new house I bought.

7
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,710
There are sample rooms.

8
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,710
No need.

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,870
The house is for you to live in.

10
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,430
As long as you two like it, it's fine.

11
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,380
Yes.

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,150
It's also close to my company.

13
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,460
You can visit my office.

14
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,580
Next time.

15
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,710
Rose hasn't been home for a year.

16
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,070
We want to stay

17
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,740
and spend time with her.

18
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,270
This smells amazing.

19
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,110
Smell it.

20
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,780
Smell it.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,030
- Smells good, right?
- Yes, it smells great.

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,500
You've cooked so much.
We won't finish it all.

23
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,620
Won't it go to waste?

24
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,710
No, whatever we can't finish
goes in the fridge.

25
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,340
We can reheat it whenever we want.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,150
Mom, the fridge is only this big.

27
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
A few meals and it's gone.

28
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,780
That's because you don't cook.

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,950
How about

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,390
I take turns with your mother-in-law?

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,780
Let her go back home and rest.

32
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,500
I can stay here and cook.

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,340
- That'll work.
- Good.

34
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,590
What now?

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,110
Come on.

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,340
What are they doing?

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,430
Are they trying to send me away?

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,870
Isn't that perfect?

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,310
Haven't you been wanting
to go back home?

40
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,550
Did I really want to leave?

41
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm doing it for you!

42
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,430
Oh my.

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,270
Son, you're so naive.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,060
You won't even realize
when you're screwed.

45
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,390
Mom, aren't you overthinking this?

46
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,660
Overthinking?

47
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,310
Since you got married,

48
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,620
they never came over.

49
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,270
Now they hear about a new house,

50
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,390
so they rush over.

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,390
Why?

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,460
The money for the house is yours.

53
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,940
Why should their family live in it?

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,950
Mom,

55
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,830
let me tell you.

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,710
After marriage,
earnings are shared property.

57
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,550
They said

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,900
the house is for us to live in.

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,180
They don't care about that.

60
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,060
They just say it nicely.

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,830
University professors.

62
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,310
We can't outsmart them.

63
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,870
Son,

64
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm talking to you.

65
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,900
Don't tell your wife how much you make.

66
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,950
Got it.

67
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,310
I thought she didn't know how to laugh.

68
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,780
I've lived here so long

69
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,300
and never seen her laugh.

70
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,390
Now her parents are here,

71
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,630
and she's all laughs.

72
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,300
Her parents are here, so she's happy.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,460
What's wrong with that?

74
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,790
Why do you have
to comment on everything?

75
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,980
I didn't say anything.

76
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,350
Where are you going?

77
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,900
Always siding with your wife.

78
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,590
Dad.

79
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,470
- Good.
- Let me toast to you.

80
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,510
This is delicious.

81
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,460
How is it? Still like the food?

82
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Yes.

83
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,980
- It's very tasty.
- Delicious.

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,390
The stir-fried celery is really good.

85
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,620
- Delicious, right?
- Yes, delicious.

86
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,300
Son, have some meat.

87
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,190
- Here.
- Eat, eat, eat.

88
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,740
How is it?

89
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,110
It's good.

90
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,700
Fang,

91
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,100
how's work lately?

92
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,390
The Development Department

93
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,100
has grown to six employees this year.

94
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,820
I'm planning

95
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,270
to hire two more testers.

96
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,340
The office is almost full.

97
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,150
I'm looking for a new place.

98
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,420
I plan to move to the Xuhui District.

99
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,900
Isn't the rent there expensive?

100
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,420
Yes, it's much higher than before.

101
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,190
But the environment is good.

102
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,780
It can improve the company's image.

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,750
You should stay within your means.

104
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,710
Appearance is important,

105
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,710
but it's not your core strength.

106
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,220
Eat more.

107
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Don't you love bamboo shoots?

108
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
Yes, I have them.

109
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,060
- Dad, I have them.
- Oh, you do.

110
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,500
Good.

111
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,270
Son, don't just talk.

112
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,900
Here. Eat some food.

113
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,980
Eat more. You've worked hard all day.

114
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,460
- Eat some.
- We made this especially for you.

115
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
I'll try some.

116
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,220
Rose seems different.

117
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,660
Like she has a lot on her mind.

118
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,710
She was carefree since she was little.

119
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Now she's

120
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,950
full of worries.

121
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,820
She told me

122
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,750
she wants to return to Beijing with us.

123
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,150
Is she not doing well here?

124
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,830
It shouldn't be.

125
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,300
Fang and his mother treat her well.

126
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,340
We'll observe for a few days.

127
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,750
If she's really unhappy,

128
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,510
we'll take her back to Beijing.

129
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,300
Is that appropriate?

130
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,740
(From Mom: We've checked into the hotel.
Everything's fine.)

131
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,580
Have your parents
checked into the hotel?

132
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,500
(From Mom: Do you have enough money?)

133
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,940
(No need, I have money.)

134
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,100
(From Mom: It's not for you.
It's for my grandchild.)

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,380
(You'll need more money
being pregnant now.)

136
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,980
Didn't you see them today?

137
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,140
Didn't talk enough?

138
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm asking if they'll have breakfast

139
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,100
at the hotel or wait for me.

140
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,540
Do you think they came suddenly

141
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,390
because they're worried about you

142
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,550
or don't trust me?

143
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,710
No, they just missed me,

144
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,750
so they came to see me.

145
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,420
They came straight here
from the train station.

146
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,670
Is it to check on me?

147
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,590
See how I'm doing?

148
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,510
Didn't my dad tell you?

149
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,860
He put the luggage here

150
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,710
to save the trouble from moving them.

151
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,710
Did you not tell them everything?

152
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,590
You didn't say you quit

153
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,980
and didn't mention my mom being here.

154
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,300
How could I say it?

155
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,190
If I did, they'd think
I can't take care of myself.

156
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,420
Is it that serious?

157
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Besides, it wasn't my idea to quit.

158
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,300
What do you mean?

159
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,590
Is that my fault?

160
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,630
After you quit your job

161
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,910
and my mom came,

162
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,630
you're much better now, right?

163
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,950
My mom cares for you all day

164
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,580
and still gets blamed.

165
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,300
When did I ever blame her?

166
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,230
You're always out.

167
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,780
Isn't it because you find her annoying?

168
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,270
She watches me like a hawk.

169
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,750
I just want some fresh air.

170
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,900
Fine.

171
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,780
All in all,

172
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,870
no matter what we do,

173
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,260
it's never right for you.

174
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,470
My mom takes care of you every day,

175
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,230
and you never smile at her.

176
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,870
Your parents came,

177
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,300
and you're all smiles.

178
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,830
When my mom saw that,

179
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,180
how would she feel?

180
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,750
It's been so long since I saw them.

181
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,500
I can't cry.

182
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,870
I can't smile.

183
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,540
That's not what I meant.

184
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,030
Of course, I'm happy

185
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,390
your parents are here.

186
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,820
I wanted to take them
to see the new house,

187
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,940
but they didn't appreciate it at all.

188
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,750
I don't know

189
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,420
what I should do

190
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,060
to earn their respect.

191
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,510
They don't look down on you.

192
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,540
They just don't want to bother you.

193
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,270
Last time we had a fight
with the roast duck.

194
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,390
Today I called you out to exercise,

195
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,750
just to blow off some steam.

196
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,350
Why exercise to blow off steam?

197
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,420
We middle-aged men
don't have that kind of fire

198
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,140
that can't be extinguished
with chrysanthemum tea.

199
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,310
It's been fine for a while.

200
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,510
How's work going for you?

201
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,940
Our boss got into trouble recently,

202
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,540
and I've figured out a lot of things.

203
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,990
You can't live too comfortably.

204
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,510
If you don't find trouble for yourself,

205
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,580
the heavens will find it for you.

206
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,390
What trouble have you
found for yourself?

207
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,350
There's someone

208
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,940
who wants me to design

209
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,180
a homestay hotel.

210
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,500
That's a good opportunity.

211
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,630
It is a good opportunity,

212
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,470
but this project is too big in scale.

213
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,300
It has to be business to business.

214
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,350
If I agree to it,

215
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,350
I'll have to quit my job

216
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,030
and start my own company.

217
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,350
Haven't you been wanting
to start your own business?

218
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,190
Now, there's a project,

219
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,780
an opportunity, and the motivation.

220
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,780
It's a great thing.

221
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,700
The opportunity is indeed good,

222
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,390
but something's off with the person

223
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,230
offering the opportunity.

224
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,190
Who is it?

225
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,700
This person

226
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,540
is Bai Xiaohe's father.

227
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,060
I didn't think it through.

228
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,270
I'll turn him down.

229
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,870
Though this has nothing to do
with Bai Xiaohe,

230
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,710
after all,

231
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,110
he's her biological father.

232
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,390
Owing him such a huge favor

233
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,230
makes it awkward for me,

234
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,310
let alone you.

235
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,140
Accept it.

236
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,110
I support you.

237
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,300
I'll come home early after work tonight,

238
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,660
and take your parents

239
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,270
to the Fairmont Peace Hotel
for dinner tonight.

240
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,390
It's far and expensive.

241
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,710
Why go there?

242
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,700
They came all the way here.

243
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,540
We should show them some hospitality.

244
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,630
I'll keep them company
and show them around,

245
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,150
and we'll just eat casually.

246
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,750
Yesterday they arrived
and rushed to cook.

247
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,700
If we don't treat them to a meal,

248
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,580
we'll seem impolite.

249
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,780
They're family,

250
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,700
not guests.

251
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,630
Let's discuss something.

252
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,780
What is it?

253
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,780
Your mother has been taking care
of me for quite a while.

254
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,630
Could my mom come over

255
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,420
and stay with me for a while?

256
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,780
Your mom wouldn't be used to it.

257
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,470
What do you mean?

258
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,150
Your mom's stay here
would be inconvenient.

259
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,270
I mean it'll be inconvenient for me.

260
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,500
Look.

261
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,510
I'm more casual at home.

262
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,420
I'll just throw on shorts

263
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,940
or go shirtless in the summer.

264
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,750
If your mom were here...

265
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,380
Right?

266
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,990
Come on.

267
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,110
Why are you always like this?

268
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,580
One idea today,

269
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,990
and another tomorrow.

270
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,420
So,

271
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,180
since your parents are here,

272
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,540
you want to drive my mom away, right?

273
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,750
I'm discussing it with you.

274
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,230
Your family

275
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,540
always does whatever they like,

276
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,300
letting things go.

277
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,700
So can I go back to Beijing
for a few days?

278
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,270
Do you really not mind?

279
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,230
If you got this project

280
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,900
because of connections, I would mind,

281
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,580
but if it's because of your abilities,

282
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,420
I don't mind.

283
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,350
Does that mean

284
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,870
you believe in my abilities now?

285
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,060
I don't know much about your industry,

286
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,180
but I've read online about your work,

287
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,220
and your reputation seems good.

288
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,620
You...

289
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,660
Are you talking about
separating from me?

290
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

291
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,150
I didn't say that.

292
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,580
I just wanted to go back to Beijing
for a few days.

293
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,540
You know I'm busy right now

294
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,380
and can't make time.

295
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,700
Why do you have to go back now?

296
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,180
Didn't you say

297
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,580
we could stay in Beijing or Shanghai

298
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,750
if I wanted to?

299
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,990
Remember.

300
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,470
You are

301
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,180
part of my family now.

302
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,780
You can't always think of yourself.

303
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,940
What did you use to say to me?

304
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,940
You said after we got married,

305
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,660
I wouldn't leave my old home,

306
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,420
but you would give me another one.

307
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,470
Now you say I'm part of your family.

308
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,830
What do you mean?

309
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,030
Isn't that right?

310
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,630
You married me.

311
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,580
You're pregnant with my child,

312
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,300
so I should take responsibility for you.

313
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,310
What's wrong with that?

314
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,990
Taking responsibility means

315
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,300
arranging my life

316
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,420
and restricting my freedom.

317
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,390
Fang Xiewen,
how did you become like this?

318
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,300
No, Huang Yimei, it's you who's changed.

319
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,870
No matter what I do,

320
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,300
I can never meet your expectations.

321
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,780
I can't be compared with others.

322
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,660
I was wrong.

323
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,940
I shouldn't have let you meet him.

324
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,150
Since then, you've been paranoid.

325
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,200
I'm not.

326
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,540
Then why don't you let me go to work?

327
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,060
Why do you control my freedom?

328
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,470
Even when I bought some flowers,

329
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,060
you sneakily asked me about it for ages.

330
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,110
And why did you buy such a big house,

331
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,530
putting so much pressure on yourself?

332
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,940
Isn't it just to compete with him?

333
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,780
I didn't.

334
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,270
I didn't want to compete with him.

335
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,510
I bought the big house

336
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,390
entirely to make you comfortable.

337
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,930
What do you mean
by the pigeonhole in Paris?

338
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,750
Why do you insist on going to Beijing?

339
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,350
Who exactly is in Beijing?

340
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,910
During this period,

341
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,430
I can clearly sense this

342
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,820
restless and anxious mood in you.

343
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,230
Of course, part of it is because of me,

344
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,300
and another part

345
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,030
is due to the issues at work.

346
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,750
Especially being implicated by those

347
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,270
unscrupulous individuals.

348
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,620
After our leader's incident,

349
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,140
the project I worked on
for two years was halted.

350
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,290
It's particularly frustrating.

351
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,710
I understand

352
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,710
your enthusiasm for work.

353
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,270
If I ask you to let go
of such a great opportunity

354
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,380
because of Bai Xiaohe,

355
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,100
am I being too narrow-minded?

356
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,420
Su,

357
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,340
I've noticed you've changed

358
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,580
and become softer.

359
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,300
Who let you down?

360
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,380
Go back up.

361
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,030
Quickly.

362
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,990
I'm saying such affectionate words.

363
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,060
What's the matter with you?

364
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,710
I used to be calmer

365
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,060
and less willing to take risks.

366
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,230
But now,

367
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,780
I'm willing to take a risk with you.

368
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,990
But what if my startup fails

369
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,230
and I lose our footing?

370
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,550
I'll support you.

371
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,750
With Mr. Bai's vision and capability,

372
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
since he chose you for this project,

373
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,620
I'm definitely going
to invest alongside.

374
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,510
Learning investment
from successful people

375
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,720
certainly increases success rates.

376
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,860
Why do I feel so energetic today?

377
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
Then add some resistance.

378
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,300
Sure.

379
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,140
Challenge accepted.

380
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,190
Good for you.

381
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,870
There's endless energy.

382
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,820
Then maintain this pace.

383
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,670
Keep it up for a minute.

384
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,030
Son.

385
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,550
Going to work.

386
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,430
Eat something.

387
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,750
Don't go on an empty stomach.

388
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,860
Can't go like this.
Hurry, eat something.

389
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,270
What's wrong?
Is she going back to Beijing?

390
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,620
No, just something she said.

391
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,270
If she wants to go back, let her,

392
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,270
so she won't be moody here every day.

393
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,910
Wherever she goes,

394
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
the child in her belly
is still ours, right?

395
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,580
I won't let her go.

396
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,270
I'm also uncomfortable here.

397
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,670
I want to go back to our hometown.

398
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,940
Every month in the future,

399
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,510
I'll give you an extra 5,000.

400
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,030
Come on.

401
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,100
Here is just so small.

402
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,430
Why did you buy it?

403
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,710
Wasn't it good
running around outside before?

404
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,470
This is my gift to you.

405
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,830
Well,

406
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,270
I'm going to the north of Jiangsu
these days

407
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,110
for Zhou Shihui.

408
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,270
I'll be gone for a few days.

409
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,100
During my absence,

410
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,030
you can use it to run.

411
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,750
Otherwise, you'd go out
for a night run alone,

412
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,590
and I'd be worried.

413
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,300
I happen to have a gift for you too.

414
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,910
I have a gift too?

415
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,270
Are you saying I can

416
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,270
freely come and go from this house now?

417
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,620
Rightfully.

418
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,580
This gift is too precious.

419
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,990
With yours and mine,

420
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,540
plus my parents',

421
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,430
I can live in three places.

422
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,860
If I move in,

423
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,470
won't my house be empty?

424
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,580
Should I quit my place?

425
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,460
No, no, no.

426
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,780
Keep yours for now.

427
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,670
If I ever find you annoying one day,

428
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,950
you can find another place to go.

429
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,670
If you find me annoying one day,

430
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,430
you can find a place
to take shelter too.

431
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,350
That's right.

432
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,140
Every month during your period,

433
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,670
I can hide in my place.

434
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,030
Last month was...

435
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,570
Next week it's your period again.

436
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,230
- I have to hide for a while.
- What are you talking about?

437
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,430
Get away from me.

438
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,620
So annoying.

439
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,030
Is that about it?

440
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,220
It'll be ready soon.

441
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,830
Come in.

442
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,100
Mr. Fang, we have a few issues

443
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,160
with the contract with Lingfeng.

444
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,790
Tell me.

445
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,910
First, their payment cycle is too long,

446
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,780
which is not favorable
for our cash flow.

447
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,780
Secondly, the final payment
of the contract

448
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,270
needs to wait
until the system goes online

449
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,110
one year later,

450
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,470
which is also unreasonable.

451
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,510
I understand.

452
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,620
You can leave now.

453
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,140
Okay.

454
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,860
(To Honey)

455
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,700
(Sorry.)

456
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:46,860
(I shouldn't have argued with you this morning.
What do you want to eat tonight?)

457
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
(Send)

458
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,380
(Route 53)

459
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,780
(Sorry, I shouldn't have argued with you
this morning. What do you want to eat tonight?)

460
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,900
Hello?

461
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,230
Hello, Su.

462
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,990
It kicked me.

463
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,310
Who?

464
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,790
The baby.

465
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,510
The baby kicked me.

466
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,140
Where are you?

467
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,190
I'm on my way to see my parents.

468
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,820
I'm on the bus.

469
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,190
It kicked me.

470
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,780
It kicked me.

471
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,110
What does it feel like?

472
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,780
It's quite amazing.

473
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,950
I've heard the fetal heartbeat
at the hospital,

474
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,980
but

475
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,230
I've never felt him move.

476
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,230
Gave you a fright, didn't it?

477
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,430
My goodness.

478
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,100
He's really a living person.

479
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,990
This is real.

480
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,340
You'll feel it more often.

481
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,270
I shouldn't have argued
with Fang Xiewen.

482
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,540
The baby must have heard it.

483
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,510
The baby's upset.

484
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,710
Did you guys argue?

485
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,870
Why?

486
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,900
It doesn't matter.

487
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,470
Suddenly, nothing seems to matter now.

488
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,820
It kicked me.

489
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,460
Su,

490
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,910
do you think I've become tacky,

491
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,620
become a woman who only talks
about children all the time?

492
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,380
No.

493
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,060
You've become an ordinary woman.

494
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,270
I feel

495
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,190
it's especially wonderful.

496
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,030
Fang,

497
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,030
why haven't you left yet?

498
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,180
Zhou,

499
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,300
do you have plans tonight?

500
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,220
Fang,

501
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,590
it's warmed up a bit.

502
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,340
Don't just drink, okay?

503
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,380
Have some dishes. Here.

504
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,950
Have a shrimp.

505
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,070
It's quite hot.

506
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,300
- Have a shrimp?
- No.

507
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,700
Fang,

508
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,620
I thought you didn't drink.

509
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,060
It's rare you're in the mood today.

510
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,940
Fang.

511
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,340
Let me say a few words.

512
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,550
Fang,

513
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,750
over these years

514
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,860
at the company,

515
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,380
you've helped me,

516
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,830
mentored me,

517
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,620
and given me opportunities.

518
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,990
I've never properly

519
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,780
thanked you.

520
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,430
Today,

521
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,470
I'll also have a drink

522
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,580
and toast to you.

523
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,270
Cheers, Zhou.

524
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,140
Thanks, Fang.

525
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,590
I know.

526
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,430
They all find me troublesome.

527
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,140
Tell me.

528
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,510
What am I doing it for?

529
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,860
What for?

530
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,300
Every matter I must oversee personally.

531
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,810
I must worry about everything

532
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,180
because

533
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,060
this is my own company.

534
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,470
You're the boss.

535
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,620
You naturally have the right
to oversee, Fang.

536
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,750
Let me tell you.

537
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,220
I'm very good

538
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,710
at reading people.

539
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,030
When you joined me back then,

540
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,380
you had just graduated

541
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,270
with no experience,

542
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,180
but at a glance,

543
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,060
I knew you had potential.

544
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,300
You were eager to learn and worked hard.

545
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,790
Look.

546
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,780
I entrusted you with the QA Department.

547
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,870
See?

548
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,830
How well have you done?

549
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,590
Fang,

550
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,710
I definitely won't embarrass you.

551
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,190
I won't.

552
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,860
Lin Hao

553
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,340
is bad at judging people.

554
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,060
He always wants to hire returnees

555
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,990
to boost our company's image.

556
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,350
That won't work.

557
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,140
Fang,

558
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,910
this is how I see it.

559
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,340
Our company now

560
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,950
actually has quite a few foreign clients.

561
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,190
Being able

562
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,910
to speak English well, and fluently

563
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,540
is useful for this kind of sales.

564
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,790
Really.

565
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,100
Isn't it just a few years abroad?

566
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,950
They were all within
the Chinese community.

567
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,060
To be blunt,

568
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,510
their English might
not be better than mine.

569
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,300
Fang,

570
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,860
don't drink anymore.

571
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,820
If you continue,
Miss Yimei will scold you.

572
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,470
By then, you... Don't.

573
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,340
Let her scold me then.

574
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,640
Anyway, she looks down on me.

575
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,380
Why do you talk like this, Fang?

576
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,860
Miss Yimei is so nice to you.

577
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,270
Zhou,

578
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,700
do you know

579
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,270
someone who's eaten French cuisine

580
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,620
can also eat street food?

581
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,270
Not because they love to eat,

582
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,540
but because they can eat.

583
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,870
Fang,

584
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,100
I haven't seen you eat street food much.

585
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,190
Liking to eat and being able to eat

586
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,950
are two different things.

587
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,270
Did you drink?

588
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,550
Rose,

589
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,510
I'm sorry.

590
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,270
I don't want you to go

591
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,620
because I'm afraid
you might not come back.

592
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,270
I'm afraid of losing you.

593
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,580
I was anxious for a moment

594
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,270
and said something harsh.

595
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,030
Don't be angry, okay?

596
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,060
I felt really upset,

597
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,780
so I had a few drinks.

598
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,220
I'm sorry.

599
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,980
I'm sorry.

600
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,830
Let's never

601
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,860
argue again,

602
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,030
okay?

603
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,990
Whoever you want to take care of you,

604
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,750
let them.

605
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,430
I won't stop you anymore.

606
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,340
Just don't go.

607
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,510
Just don't leave me,

608
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,750
okay?

609
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,780
It kicked me today.

610
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,310
These are all new today.

611
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,870
Do you want a bunch?

612
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,100
No.

613
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,150
Here, here.

614
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,580
Give me your bag.

615
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,540
You've bought a car.

616
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,460
A second-hand one.

617
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,460
Get in the car.

618
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,790
A child seat.

619
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,740
When? A boy or a girl?

620
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,390
A boy. He's two years old.

621
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,990
Then I have to give a big red envelope.

622
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,220
Looks like I came for nothing this time.

623
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,860
(Beipu Station)

624
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,350
Come on.

625
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,660
Have you thought it through?

626
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,310
Are you going to Beijing
and leave the child here?

627
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,870
I have to earn money, Zhenhua.

628
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,540
My wife and I

629
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,390
are both locals.

630
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,620
Both sets of parents can help
look after the child.

631
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,830
You've seen it yourself.

632
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,390
This place is tiny.

633
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,230
Even if everything's
torn down and rebuilt,

634
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,470
it still can't compare to Beijing's CBD.

635
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,310
Small place but stable.

636
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,340
No matter what, you'll make money.

637
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,470
Yuan Zheng and I
are leaving the Institute

638
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,950
to take huge risks.

639
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,100
We've either become millionaires

640
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,350
or down-and-out poor.

641
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,540
Zhenhua,

642
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,140
no need to say more.

643
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
I'm with you.

644
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,940
Come on.

645
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,100
There's an ugly truth I have to say now.

646
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,190
I know.

647
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,260
Don't go looking for Rose.

648
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,540
She's doing well now,

649
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,830
isn't she?

650
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,500
Yes.

651
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,350
I'm about to become an uncle.

652
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,500
(Outpatient Department, Huashan Hospital,
Fudan University)

653
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,100
Rose, it'll be okay.

654
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,540
Don't worry.

655
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,030
We're all here, Rose.

656
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,870
Don't be scared.

657
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,310
You'll be giving birth soon.

658
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,180
(Delivery Room)

659
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,390
We're waiting outside for you.

660
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,230
Go for it.

661
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,270
Take deep breaths.

662
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,030
Push slowly.

663
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Listen to me.

664
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,790
Deep breaths.

665
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,350
Then push downwards.

666
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,310
This will be very smooth.

667
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,150
Don't be nervous.

668
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,170
Relax.

669
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,790
Mom?

670
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,020
You're at the hospital?

671
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,360
Yes.

672
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,720
Rose has been taken
to the delivery room.

673
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,140
She's in the delivery room?

674
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,430
Wasn't her due date next week?

675
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,310
As long as it's full term,

676
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,510
she could give birth at any time.

677
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,220
It's your fault. We should have gone
to Shanghai earlier.

678
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,060
Okay, okay. It's my fault.

679
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,030
Mom, don't worry.

680
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,220
Both Su and I are here.

681
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,730
When everything's arranged here,

682
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,910
we'll book your tickets

683
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,750
so you can come.

684
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,790
I'll give you a call after this.

685
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,830
Alright, alright.

686
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,700
We'll leave it to you and Su.

687
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,500
Sure.

688
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,270
Your mom must be worried.

689
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,030
Yes. This is so sudden.

690
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,870
Who would have known?

691
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,790
Have you decided?

692
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,870
Do you want an epidural or not?

693
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,830
What's the situation now?

694
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,670
Hurry up and decide.

695
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,950
Stop dilly-dallying.

696
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,180
The anesthesia goes into the spine,

697
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,140
not into the uterus.

698
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,390
It won't affect the child.

699
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,430
You're a graduate student.

700
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,790
Don't you even know
this common knowledge?

701
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,580
No, no, no.

702
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,100
Don't be in such a hurry.

703
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,430
Women have to endure pain
when giving birth.

704
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,700
There's no need for anesthesia.

705
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,390
It's not good for the child,
absolutely not.

706
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,470
It's my sister who's in pain.

707
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,350
I'll pay for the epidural. Quickly!

708
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,490
Come here and sign. Hurry up and sign.

709
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,220
No, what are you doing?

710
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,100
- Don't rush like that.
- Please keep quiet.

711
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
This is the operating room.

712
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,530
Will you sign or not?

713
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,660
If you don't sign, I'll tell the nurse

714
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,630
the child's father was killed
in a car accident on his way here.

715
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,310
I'll sign as the uncle.

716
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,040
Why are you speaking so harshly?

717
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,800
Are you cursing my son?

718
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,310
- This is too much.
- Hesitate for one more minute,

719
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,890
and she'll have to endure
another minute of pain.

720
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,310
What? Don't rush.

721
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,200
- I'll sign.
- This...

722
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,580
We have to think it through
before we sign.

723
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,270
What's this?

724
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,060
Who hasn't given birth?
What's wrong with pain?

725
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,140
Things are different now.

726
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,060
Different how?

727
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,830
Who hasn't given birth?

728
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,580
My niece.

729
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,350
I'm an uncle now.

730
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,700
Such a big fuss,

731
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,870
and it turns out to be a girl.

732
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,350
I'm an uncle now.

733
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,230
Hug her.

734
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,270
So adorable.

735
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,350
Look how pretty our little girl is.

736
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,630
No scars, right?

737
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,190
None.

738
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,900
Absolutely none?

739
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,580
Absolutely. I told you earlier.

740
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,870
Come.

741
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,540
Uncle will bless you

742
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,830
with all his lifelong skills,

743
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,790
guaranteeing you get into Tsinghua.

744
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,580
Look, her eyes are open.

745
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,950
Did she just open her eyes?

746
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,660
She received the blessings.

747
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,940
Baby.

748
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,350
Baby.

749
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,510
(My dear daughter,)

750
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,990
(today marks our first farewell.)

751
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,260
(You bid farewell to my body,)

752
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,740

(From now on,)

754
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,470
(I can no longer
protect you with my body,)

755
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,870
(and separate you from this world.)

756
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,790
(Just thinking about this)

757
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,100
(makes me feel
incredibly lost and worried.)

758
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,740
(Compared to this loss and worry,)

759
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,390
(all the pain in childbirth is trivial.)

760
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,910
(I am your mother,)

761
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,470
(but what I can and cannot do)

762
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,830
(is extremely limited,)

763
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,990
(yet you have given me so much.)

764
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,660
(The fact that you exist)

765
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,540
(makes me happy.)

766
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,220
(The world is vast.)

767
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,430
(One can hardly know
a fraction in a lifetime.)

768
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,750
(My dear,)

769
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,040
(I chose to bring you into this world)

770
