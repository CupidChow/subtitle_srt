=Episode 35=

3
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,990
Put it here.

4
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,820
- Is it on?
- Yes.

5
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,070
Almost ready.

6
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,350
They're here.

7
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,180
Welcome to our mountain base camp.

8
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,030
Why are you here?

9
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,260
At our pace,

10
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,500
we can't make it in one day.

11
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,990
We'll camp here and continue tomorrow.

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,460
Come on in and sit.

13
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,300
- Come on in.
- Let's go.

14
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,180
Take a rest.

15
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,460
Give it to me.

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,580
- This...
- Isn't it nice?

17
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,870
Did you set this all up?

18
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,900
Miss Yimei arranged everything.

19
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,060
She prepared for a long time

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,780
so we could stay overnight.

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,020
It's okay.

22
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,060
Look.

23
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,230
There's fruit too.

24
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,110
Have a burger. Here.

25
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,710
- There are grapes too.
- Such a surprise.

26
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,660
The noodles are just ready.

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,310
- Have some water.
- You didn't tell me.

28
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,900
So comfortable.

29
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,300
A shooting star!

30
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,300
Where?

31
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,500
Gone.

32
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,300
Liar.

33
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,500
You missed it.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,460
Do you believe in aliens?

35
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,110
Impossible.

36
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,740
No planet has been found to support life.

37
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,780
The Universe

38
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,150
is so vast,

39
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,460
with so few planets that can support life.

40
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,030
We are so lucky

41
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,310
to live

42
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,220
on a planet with air, water,

43
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,310
and sunlight,

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,590
and in its

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,110
most stable period.

46
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,270
Maybe they're different from us.

47
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,270
Maybe they don't need water and air.

48
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,430
Maybe they're not
carbon-based life forms.

49
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,500
They might live off dirt

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,710
and sunlight.

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,060
If we could evolve like that,

52
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,780
could we live on other planets?

53
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,990
But then

54
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,630
my brother would be out of a job.

55
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,470
Why?

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
Because sound

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,390
travels through the air.

58
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,100
No air, no sound,

59
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,220
and no music for my brother.

60
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,550
No music.

61
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,630
You're a know-it-all.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,780
You really know how to kill the mood.

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,140
Come on.

64
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,190
Mimi, why did you fall for this bookworm?

65
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,510
He has no sense of romance.

66
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm just stating facts. Really.

67
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,660
- Stop it.
- It's true...

68
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,590
Please, stop.

69
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,470
Have some grapes.

70
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,790
I need

71
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,150
to tell you something.

72
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,830
I've registered for a body donation.

73
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,990
What did you say?

74
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,660
I've registered for a body donation.

75
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,820
Such a big decision.

76
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,390
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,780
It's my body.

78
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,100
It was given by our parents.

79
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,190
If they were here,

80
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,150
they wouldn't agree.

81
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,830
Jiamin, calm down.

82
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,670
Listen to me.

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,740
I think

84
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,510
living well together

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,710
while alive is what matters.

86
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,540
What happens after death

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,420
isn't important.

88
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,980
I want my body to be useful

89
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,830
even after I'm gone.

90
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,710
And I want you

91
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,630
to remember me

92
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,460
as I was alive,

93
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,100
not just a pile of ashes.

94
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,620
No.

95
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,820
I don't agree.

96
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,870
Absolutely not.

97
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,420
If I miss you,

98
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,950
I won't have a place to visit.

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,460
Visit me at the Elephant Music Bar.

100
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,540
Pretend I'm still performing there, right?

101
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,590
You and Mimi got married there, didn't you?

102
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,110
Miss Yimei,

103
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,750
can you talk him out of it?

104
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,630
Rest early.

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,980
We have to climb tomorrow.

106
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,470
What do you think?

107
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,390
You've decided.

108
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,660
I believe you understand me.

109
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,500
I also believe

110
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,510
you can persuade Jiamin.

111
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,670
Thank you.

112
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,470
Jiamin, Mimi.

113
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,790
Thank you.

114
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,860
Don't worry. We'll clean up.

115
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,030
Stay safe.

116
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,470
Jiamin.

117
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,590
Jiamin.

118
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,540
Bye.

119
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,710
Let's go.

120
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,300
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

121
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,780
Bye-bye.

122
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,150
Stay safe.

123
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,660
Take a break?

124
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,020
Rest a bit?

125
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,230
Okay.

126
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,870
Am I doing good?

127
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
Keep going.

128
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,700
One more hour to go.

129
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,900
Look.

130
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,630
Is it going to rain?

131
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,870
Why is it suddenly raining?

132
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,110
I checked the weather forecast.

133
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,780
The weather is unpredictable.

134
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,420
Who knows when this rain will stop?

135
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,700
If it doesn't stop,
we won't reach the top.

136
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,940
Then let's not go up.

137
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,750
Are you kidding?

138
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,270
I've put in so much effort,

139
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,180
made so many plans,

140
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,150
and scouted so many mountains.

141
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,870
We're almost there.

142
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,900
You've done enough.

143
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,190
Not enough.

144
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,820
We're almost at the top.

145
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,150
We're so close.

146
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,750
If we don't go now...

147
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,900
We won't have another chance.

148
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,780
Is that what you mean?

149
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,870
Why do we need to reach the top?

150
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,180
I promised you

151
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,750
I'd let you record the mountain wind.

152
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,820
You promised yourself.

153
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,630
I never said we had to record it.

154
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,900
It's okay if we can't.

155
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,470
Just a minor regret.

156
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,700
I don't want to leave you with regrets.

157
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,750
But I have so many regrets.

158
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,420
So what?

159
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,510
When I die,

160
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,900
all regrets will be erased.

161
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,990
Understand?

162
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,750
Can you stop using that word?

163
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,300
You're not dead yet.

164
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,030
Do you know what fickleness is?

165
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,940
This rain is fickleness.

166
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,300
No matter how well you prepare,

167
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,540
no matter how well you plan,

168
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,510
we still can't reach the mountaintop.

169
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,750
Not everything will go

170
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,230
according to your wishes.

171
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,060
You have to accept what you can't change.

172
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,230
I won't accept it!

173
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,390
I disagree!

174
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,110
I won't allow it!

175
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,180
Calm down.

176
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,870
I can't calm down.

177
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,390
Please calm down.

178
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,590
Listen to me.

179
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,190
This climb

180
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,780
is our farewell.

181
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,110
Afterward, forget me completely.

182
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,300
Not everything can be fought against.

183
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,590
Huang Yimei,

184
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,630
I'm dying soon.

185
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,990
You must learn to accept this, okay?

186
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,820
Can you stop preaching?

187
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,110
I don't want to hear it.

188
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,660
Of course, you can say that, right?

189
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,060
When you die, you leave everything behind.

190
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,150
Close your eyes,

191
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,660
and it's all over.

192
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,060
What about the living?

193
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,390
We are the ones who suffer.

194
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,750
Have you thought about my feelings?

195
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,110
Have you thought about
your brother's feelings?

196
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,700
You won't even leave us your ashes.

197
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,350
When we miss you,

198
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,420
where do we go?

199
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,150
Then don't miss me, okay?

200
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,950
Huang Yimei,

201
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,420
I'm telling you.

202
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,470
This climb

203
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,820
is our farewell.

204
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,270
Afterward,

205
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,150
forget me.

206
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,510
You must learn to accept it.

207
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,900

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,790

- Come here.
- I don't want to go.

340
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,230
Keep reciting.

341
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,430
Mom, why did you transfer money again?

342
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,430
You have a loan for your house
and need to pay interest.

343
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,140
We don't spend our pensions.

344
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,390
It's for you kids eventually.

345
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,510
No need. We have money.

346
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,790
I know you do,

347
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,660
but Zhenhua hasn't been doing well.

348
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,470
Raising kids

349
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,310
on your salary alone isn't enough.

350
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,140
Don't worry.

351
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,030
His company is just transitioning.

352
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,060
It's temporary.

353
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,180
I have faith in him.

354
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,350
You always spoil him.

355
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,020
Thanks, Mom.

356
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,060
What are you doing?

357
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,940
What's wrong?

358
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,220
Your aunt isn't back yet.

359
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,580

00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,790
Have some organic milk.

363
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,260
It's nutritious.

364
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,430
The promotion on social media

365
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,660
went well.

366
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,620
For the next six months,

367
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,990
the contemporary art exhibit in Shanghai

368
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,060
will need publicity.

369
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,430
We should use the same strategy.

370
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,310
I'm looking for new marketing channels.

371
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,950
Any issues with the last company?

372
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,950
Why change?

373
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,430
Their promotion was strong,

374
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,470
but their methods were unprofessional.

375
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,870
We gave them so much material,

376
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,220
but they used less than half.

377
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,700
Why?

378
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,540
No headlines.

379
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,700
They wanted
to dig into the artists' private lives,

380
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,140
just to create some buzz.

381
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,540
Sorry.

382
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,790
Last night,

383
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,060
I couldn't sleep.

384
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,060
Please continue.

385
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,870
Methods vary from person to person.

386
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,140
As long as it can promote

387
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,260
and is profitable, that's enough.

388
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,500
Sorry.

389
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,470
We are promoting art.

390
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,030
The focus should be on the art itself.

391
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,640
If we rely on gossip and scandals

392
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,700
(Zhuang Guodong)
for promotion,

393
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,260
how are we different from internet celebrities?

394
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,830
The flight was delayed. Sorry, I'm late.

395
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,620
For this contemporary art
exhibition promotion,

396
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,790
I will strictly oversee it.

397
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,060
I'll send out a proposal soon.

398
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,950
All the big artists
asked for her to curate.

399
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,390
I think we should
just follow her lead. Agreed?

400
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,710
No objections.

401
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,580
Alright.

402
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,700
I trust Yimei's judgment. It's up to her.

403
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,540
If there are no more questions
on this topic,

404
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,510
let's move on.

405
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,510
Coming from Hong Kong, China

406
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,390
you didn't bring us any local specialties?

407
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,030
You don't visit Hong Kong, China often?

408
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,150
Need me to bring stuff?

409
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,470
You've managed
to be the VP of Asia Pacific.

410
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,910
Why are you still traveling around?

411
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
Come on.

412
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,030
When did I manage?

413
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,100
He naturally has it.

414
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,620
He's tall,

415
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,140
so he sits high.

416
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,910
Yes, because I'm tall,

417
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,030
I have to personally handle

418
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,950
images and resources.

419
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,580
The real reason you flew here today

420
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,990
is to celebrate her birthday, right?

421
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,020
Where's the gift?

422
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,580
Gift?

423
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,710
I don't have one.

424
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,870
How about I treat you to dinner?

425
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,190
Not today.

426
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,270
You owe me one.

427
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,310
They've prepared a surprise party at home.

428
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,030
I have to go and pretend to be surprised.
