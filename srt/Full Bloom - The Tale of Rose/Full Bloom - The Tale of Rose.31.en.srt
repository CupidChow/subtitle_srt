=Episode 31=

3
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,250
He gave me the money voluntarily.

4
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,910
Did he regret it

5
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,200
and send you to get it back?

6
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,690
Or did he hear something?

7
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,480
Hear what?

8
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,130
Those unspeakable things.

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,560
The one who can't face the public

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,590
is not me.

11
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,210
He knew

12
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,560
what happened before.

13
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,560
Did he know

14
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,830
about your father?

15
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,870
So you admit it now.

16
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,600
You know what he did to me.

17
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,980
Well,

18
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,720
just that one time, right?

19
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,580
He said he drank too much and can't remember.

20
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,860
Did you know he raped me?

21
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,130
Lower your voice. Don't let the neighbors hear.

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,210
You've never admitted it.

23
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,930
You said I slandered him.

24
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,300
You're my mother.

25
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,550
I was so young back then.

26
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,900
Why didn't you protect me?

27
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,350
Why didn't you call the police?

28
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,790
If I had called the police,

29
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,370
wouldn't all our neighbors know?

30
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,440
What would everyone think?

31
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,810
They'd say you seduced your stepfather.

32
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,760
How could I face anyone after this?

33
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,950
I've swallowed my pride

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,690
for your sake.

35
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,490
I seduced him?

36
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,840
That's not what I meant.

37
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,090
But think about it.

38
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,620
You, a teenage girl,

39
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,110
hung around in front of him every day.

40
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,650
Wouldn't he get ideas?

41
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,230
Every woman faces that sort of thing.

42
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,130
Close your eyes and it's over.

43
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,440
Who made your real dad die so early?

44
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,410
He took us in and saved our lives.

45
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,410
Otherwise, we'd have starved.

46
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,410
He's our savior.

47
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,370
For a meal,

48
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,490
you repaid him with your daughter?

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,810
Without that meal,

50
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,200
would you still be alive today?

51
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

52
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,250
You blame me

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,880
for being useless,

54
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,560
but I had to keep us all alive.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Do you think I wanted to do this?

56
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,850
I'm a woman too.

57
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,730
At least he wanted you.

58
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,390
If he'd been tempted

59
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,640
by those women outside,

60
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,850
how could we have survived?

61
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,780
You're awake.

62
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,880
Did I wake you up?

63
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,850
Do you have plans today?

64
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,960
Why is the alarm so early?

65
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,880
I forgot to turn it off yesterday.

66
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,080
Go back to sleep. It's still early.

67
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,820
He wants to add music to our exhibits?

68
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,370
Yes, it's his inspiration.

69
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,610
Like the painting in that little room.

70
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,810
I want to pick a few paintings for experiments.

71
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,810
Experimenting is fine.

72
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

73
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,570
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

74
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,400
I heard you're adding music to our work.

75
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,540
I think it's a good idea.

76
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
But I'm not sure

77
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,190
if putting audio equipment next to the artwork

78
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,920
will affect the viewing experience.

79
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,150
We should discuss this

80
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,780
with the artists

81
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,870
and see if they're okay

82
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,950
with adding sound to their work.

83
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,710
If they agree,

84
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll handle the exhibit design.

85
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,660
We also need to discuss with them

86
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,880
about the specific music style.

87
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,780
Have you seen these works?

88
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,610
Is there one that inspires you?

89
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,190
I think that one over there is good.

90
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,370
- Let me show you.
- Sure.

91
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,620
Here.

92
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
Look at this.

93
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,680
The lines are intricate yet not chaotic,

94
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,920
seemingly rhythmic-like music.

95
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,230
Also, the bold and bright colors

96
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,450
capture the vitality of nature.

97
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,570
I personally think this one fits well.

98
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,680
It also has a distinctive style.

99
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,370
Hello, Su.

100
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,740
Where are you?

101
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,160
I thought

102
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,490
leaving that house

103
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,750
would free me from them

104
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,850
and the past.

105
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,640
Turns out it's impossible.

106
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,520
I hate them.

107
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,730
I hate myself too.

108
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,490
They're not worth your hatred.

109
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,280
Hate only consumes you.

110
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,680
I shouldn't have yelled at Zhenhua.

111
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,210
He's the most innocent.

112
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,610
Can you help me find a counselor?

113
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,210
I want to start counseling.

114
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,610
It was my fault.

115
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,400
I shouldn't have borrowed so much money
behind your back

116
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,210
and given it to Mom

117
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,850
without discussing it with you.

118
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,610
I know what kind of person my mom is.

119
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,150
This mess started because of her.

120
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,880
So, it's not your fault.

121
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,230
I also yelled at you before.

122
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,070
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,190
We don't need to blame ourselves.

124
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,040
But there's one more thing.

125
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,070
I want you to know

126
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,610
I've always handled

127
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,970
our family's mess alone

128
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,330
because

129
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,920
I didn't want

130
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,680
to drag you into it.

131
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm your husband.

132
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,800
That's exactly why

133
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,750
I don't want to see you borrow money

134
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,800
with an insincere smile to satisfy my mom.

135
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,540
Most of our money is in the bank.

136
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,860
There's one due soon.

137
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,040
When it matures, I'll withdraw it.

138
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,570
Give it back to Zhou, okay?

139
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,550
It's okay.

140
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,800
It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry.

141
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,700
Thank you.

142
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,000
Mimi's parents settled abroad,

143
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,030
originally planned to return last month.

144
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,420
First, there were visa issues,

145
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,570
and after finally sorting that out,

146
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,250
the flight got canceled.

147
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,920
Now, they can't find available tickets.

148
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,730
The wedding is the day after tomorrow.

149
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,040
It's a traditional Chinese wedding.

150
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,110
First bow to heaven and earth.

151
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,540
Then to the parents.

152
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,520
But there are no parents here.

153
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,800
There will be a solution.

154
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,860
Elder brothers are like fathers.

155
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,330
You can bow to Jiaming.

156
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,160
What will they call me?

157
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,660
Will they still

158
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,990
call me by my name?

159
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,090
We aren't sworn siblings.

160
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,520
Of course not.

161
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,350
Let's think of another way.

162
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,280
If it doesn't work out,

163
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,310
we have two ready parents

164
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,210
at home you can borrow.

165
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,380
You're back.

166
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,000
Why are we suddenly

167
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,390
going to be parents to someone else?

168
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,640
You're godparents.

169
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,090
We haven't even met this godson,

170
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,380
and we're attending his wedding?

171
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,580
This is a last-minute solution.

172
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,400
Don't be too hung up on formality.

173
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,060
Not only you two will be there,

174
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,500
I also have to officiate.

175
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,260
You two just need to sit

176
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,110
at the main table.

177
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,210
It's just fake.

178
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,860
Neither of you had a wedding before.

179
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,570
Why are you so eager about someone else's?

180
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,060
It's not like that.

181
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,190
He's different.

182
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,130
Fu Jiamin is my colleague,

183
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,640
and,

184
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,900
rounding off,

185
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,130
we have some other connections.

186
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,850
Keeping us guessing, huh?

187
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,330
Tell us, or we won't go.

188
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,330
He has a brother named Fu Jiaming.

189
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,390
(Elephant Music Bar)
Congratulations!

190
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,900
- Thank you, thank you.
- Congratulations.

191
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,230
Thank you. Please come in.

192
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,070
Thank you, thank you.

193
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,960
Congratulations.

194
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,660
Fu Jiaming!

195
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,420
Fang Taichu, you're so beautiful.

196
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,760
Like a New Year's painting doll.

197
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,520
- Hello, Mrs. Huang.
- Hello.

198
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,310
You're Jiaming, right?

199
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,150
Hello, Mr. Huang.

200
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,310
Jiaming.

201
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,710
Thank you so much for coming to the rescue.

202
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,880
Really appreciate it.

203
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,370
It's nothing.

204
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,460
Well,

205
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,990
when my two kids got married,

206
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,730
they didn't have weddings.

207
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,310
Shall we rehearse a bit?

208
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,680
Don't worry.

209
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,230
Please sit at the main table.

210
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,350
Eat and drink as you like.

211
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,710
Jiamin and Mimi

212
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,780
will bow to you.

213
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,620
It's very simple.

214
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,900
Come on in, please.

215
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,740
Please come in.

216
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,220
Let me help you. Fang Taichu, here.

217
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,070
Come.

218
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,950
- This way, please.
- Okay.

219
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,130
Looks great.

220
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,680
Jiamin, Mimi, come.

221
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,030
- Please come in.
- Congratulations.

222
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,890
- Okay, okay.
- Miss Yimei.

223
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,740
Come.

224
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,500
Really nice.

225
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,500
Jiamin, greet them.

226
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,330
Mr. and Mrs. Huang.

227
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,210
Dad, Mom.

228
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,190
Dad, Mom.

229
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,280
Very nice. First meeting.

230
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,270
Congratulations.

231
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,110
Sit down first.

232
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,610
Bring the flowers over.

233
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,780
Let me put it on Dad.

234
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,230
- Thank you. Okay.
- Let me put it on Mom.

235
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,490
Be careful. Don't poke yourself.

236
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,030
Okay.

237
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,540
Putting it on for you.

238
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,470
Okay, okay.

239
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,370
Please sit and rest for a while.

240
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,820
- I'll go to the kitchen.
- Okay, okay.

241
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,660
I'll be back soon.

242
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,450
- You sit first.
- Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,950
- Okay.
- You go ahead.

244
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,250
- You go ahead.
- I'll leave first.

245
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,370
Thanks to Mom and Dad.

246
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,620
Sir, don't fry the fish too long.

247
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,520
There are elders present.

248
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,700
Thank you.

249
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,700
No problem.

250
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,480
Open your mouth.

251
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,610
Let's take a photo. Great.

252
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,830
Okay.

253
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,090
This time,

254
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,300
she didn't make a mistake.

255
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,140
What?

256
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,140
Don't know if your standards have lowered

257
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,050
or if your daughter's standards have risen.

258
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,910
The one she liked passed

259
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,290
in one go.

260
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,480
Be objective.

261
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,740
The young man looks good.

262
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,810
Tell me.

263
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,580
What do you think his flaw is?

264
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,850
He is indeed flawless.

265
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,680
But at his age, why hasn't he married yet?

266
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,160
Maybe he divorced.

267
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,010
Maybe he's waiting for the right one.

268
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,820
Right, he preferred being alone

269
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,880
before he met your daughter.

270
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,330
That's what I mean.

271
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,100
Look here.

272
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,470
One, two, three.

273
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,060
- Uncle.
- Calling you.

274
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,670
Calling you, Uncle.

275
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,680
Taichu.

276
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,990
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Huang.

277
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,330
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

278
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,240
This outfit is so nice,

279
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,330
like a landlord and landlady.

280
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,400
Your mom bought it yesterday.

281
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,960
Why didn't Su come?

282
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,880
She can't make it.

283
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,810
What should I say?

284
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,910
Say whatever you want.

285
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,530
You can start with a topic,

286
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,680
or you can ask me questions.

287
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,820
Let me drink some water.

288
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,660
Sure.

289
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,230
Thank you.

290
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,990
Everyone, welcome to attend

291
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,780
the wedding of Mr. Fu Jiamin,

292
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,160
and Miss Zhou Kemi.

293
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,430
Two families united

294
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,610
for a marriage covenant.

295
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,260
Matching names

296
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,640
make a good marriage forever.

297
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,230
The peach blossoms bloom today,

298
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,780
perfect for getting married.

299
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,500
May your family continue,

300
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,720
like the stretching melon vines.

301
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,510
Here you agree to grow old together.

302
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,820
It shall be written down

303
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
on red leaves to be recorded

304
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,160
as a destined couple.

305
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm very sure about one thing.

306
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,470
Whether you are elders

307
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,870
or peers of the same age,

308
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,540
you must deeply cherish them

309
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,680
in your daily lives.

310
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,300
Congratulations on your wedding.

311
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,340
Thank you, thank you.

312
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,160
Congratulations on your wedding.

313
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,720
Enjoy yourselves.

314
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,100
Okay, okay.

315
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,540
You want some cucumbers?

316
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,440
Sure, some cucumbers.

317
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,820
Luckily, my arm is long,

318
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,370
or we wouldn't get to eat good food.

319
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,020
- Cheers.
- Thank you, thank you.

320
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,130
Enjoy yourselves.

321
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,620
Jiaming fainted.

322
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,460
Come with me.

323
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,850
Yes, this fish...

324
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
What's that sound outside?

325
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,770
I heard it too.

326
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,420
Jiamin.

327
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
Come.

328
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,680
Please sit here.

329
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,560
Okay, okay.

330
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,290
Your brother fainted upstairs.

331
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,900
Hello?

332
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,300
Is this the hospital? Someone fainted here.

333
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm at...

334
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,850
Near Houhai.

335
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,860
(Emergency)

336
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,910
(Emergency Room)

337
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,130
Jiaming must be fine, right?

338
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,810
He'll be fine.

339
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,160
He should be fine.

340
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,200
(Emergency Room)
He'll be fine.

341
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,820
(Emergency)

342
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,060
- How's Fu Jiaming?
- How's he doing?

343
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,130
The doctors are still trying.

344
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,670
My brother hasn't had it in years.

345
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,370
They always say he was recovering well.

346
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,160
- You can't think like that.
- It's all my fault.

347
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,910
Don't blame yourself.

348
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,200
What does your brother have?

349
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,060
It's all my fault.

350
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,570
What does your brother have?

351
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,880
Why did this happen?

352
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,870
Why did I have the wedding?

353
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,770
Jiaming.

354
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,160
I shouldn't have had the wedding.

355
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,050
He has congenital heart disease,

356
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,050
had open-heart surgery before he turned one,

357
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,160
and another repair ten years ago.

358
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,230
He used to look so healthy.

359
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,570
We didn't expect him to be sick.

360
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,330
When he walks and climbs stairs,

361
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,240
he struggles much more than us,

362
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,920
like carrying a sandbag on his back.

363
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,680
It's been like this since he was little,

364
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,130
so he's gotten used to it.

365
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,400
(Emergency Room)
Doctor, how is he?

366
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,980
The vital signs are stable now,

367
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,190
but he needs to stay in intensive care

368
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,190
for observation for a while.

369
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,260
Don't worry.

370
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,100
Okay.

371
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,070
Stable now.

372
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,150
No life-threatening danger.

373
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,570
Great. My brother is okay.

374
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,880
My brother is okay.

375
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,300
My brother is okay.

376
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,140
Jiamin,

377
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,150
your brother needs to stay in the hospital.

378
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,960
Go home and prepare some daily necessities.

379
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,670
- Important things.
- Okay.

380
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,510
- I'll pack things.
- Let's go.

381
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,960
I'll go home now and pack things.

382
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,270
I'm back.

383
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,290
How is he?

384
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,770
He's been revived,

385
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,370
but he's still unconscious.

386
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,230
Where's your sister?

387
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,710
She's at the hospital.

388
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,400
I'll go see her tomorrow.

389
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,830
Where's Taichu?

390
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
She was scared and cried all the way.

391
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,370
I finally got her to sleep.

392
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,340
Zhenhua,

393
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,240
what's wrong with his condition?

394
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,010
It's a long story.

395
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,130
It's congenital.

396
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,050
Didn't Rose

397
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,050
know about this situation before?

398
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,050
You know, Rose is like that.

399
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,620
(Fang Xiewen)

400
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,570
Fang.

401
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,790
Mom,

402
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,880
is Rose home?

403
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,810
She's not home. What do you need?

404
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,470
I just wanted to ask her

405
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,530
when she would bring Taichu to Shanghai.

406
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,240
I've been unable to reach her by phone.

407
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,160
Nothing happened, did it?

408
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,230
Nothing.

409
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,100
Maybe her phone's on silent

410
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,400
or it's out of battery.

411
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,370
Okay, then I'll call her later.

412
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,480
Hello? Mom?

413
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,300
What's wrong with Taichu?

414
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,330
Is Taichu crying?

415
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,740
Is Taichu sick?

416
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,880
- Everything's okay.
- Taichu.

417
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,950
- Taichu is sleeping.
- Don't cry.

418
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,330
She must've had a nightmare.

419
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,060
Taichu, Taichu.

420
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,190
Don't cry. Good girl.

421
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,580
- Don't cry.
- Grandpa is here.

422
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,050
- Grandma is here.
- Don't cry.

423
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,270
- Don't cry.
- Don't be scared.

424
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,190
Don't cry, Taichu. Daddy is here.

425
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,430
(Fang Xiewen)
Taichu, what happened?

426
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,500
Daddy, Fu Jiaming is dead.

427
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,440
Dead.

428
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,920
It's alright.

429
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,010
Taichu had a nightmare. It's not true.

430
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,530
Huang, you're there.

431
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,870
Don't be afraid.

432
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,380
He's just tired and needs some rest.

433
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,750
- He'll get up soon.
- Taichu.

434
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,910
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

435
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,850
- Taichu is a good girl.
- Okay.

436
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,710
Wait till I reach Rose.

437
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,060
I'll have her return your call.

438
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,990
It's getting late now.

439
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,190
Both the old and the young need rest.

440
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,030
Talk to you later.

441
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,920
Huang, don't hang up on me.

442
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,780
Why did Taichu cry like this?

443
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,960
Who's Fu Jiaming?

444
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,500
(Outpatient Department)

445
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,330
You're up.

446
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,440
How do you feel?

447
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,960
I'll tell Jiamin you're awake.

448
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,330
Sorry.

449
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,880
I should have told you earlier.

450
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,480
I know I'm a patient.

451
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,610
How can I

452
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,440
fall in love

453
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,750
like a normal person?

454
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,850
Stop that.

455
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,330
Always harboring unrealistic hopes.

456
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,240
I was too greedy.

457
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,160
Do you still feel dizzy now?

458
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,090
Look at my fingers.

459
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,240
Good. Try moving your hand.

460
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,220
(Outpatient Department)

461
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,530
I heard from your brother.

462
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,810
What are you planning to do?

463
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,530
I'm too weak to think.

464
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,860
(9 missed calls, 15 unread messages)

465
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,980
(Mom: How is Jiaming?)

466
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,060
(Mom: We're home now. Don't worry.)

467
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,340
(Dad: Still at the hospital?)

468
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,390
(Dad: How is it going?)

469
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,370
(Dad: Will you come home tonight?)

470
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,580
(Mom: Your brother told us he's okay.
Just stay at the hospital tonight.)

471
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,060
(Mom: The child is asleep.
Won't call you tonight.)

472
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,540
(Calling Records, Fang Xiewen)

473
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,150
I need to call him back.

474
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,960
It might be about Taichu.

475
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

476
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,480
Sorry, yesterday

477
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,290
I was busy, so I didn't check my phone.

478
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,940
Are you okay?

479
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,310
I'm fine.

480
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,680
What do you need?

481
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,720
I just wanted to ask you

482
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,160
when you'll bring Taichu to Shanghai.

483
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,920
I've been busy lately.

484
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,290
Haven't had a chance to arrange it yet.

485
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,050
I'll let you know once it's confirmed.

486
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,330
Yesterday, I couldn't find you,

487
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,200
so I called your mom.

488
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,680
I've heard about it.

489
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,850
Taichu was frightened and cried.

490
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,400
She kept having nightmares.

491
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,710
Huang Yimei, who is Fu Jiaming?

492
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,710
If I'm not mistaken,

493
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,330
he's your new boyfriend, right?

494
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,290
It's your freedom to date someone.

495
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,050
I have no right to interfere.

496
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,810
But at least find someone healthy.

497
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,050
Even if not for yourself,

498
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,160
at least for your daughter's sake.

499
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,100
It's okay now.

500
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,130
Go back and get a good sleep.

501
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,810
Think about it when you wake up.

502
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,920
Prepare for the worst.

503
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,570
Some things

504
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,820
can only be solved by you.

505
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,960
You have to bear it yourself.

506
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,340
Su,

507
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,070
I'm scared.

508
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,050
Then throw it away.

509
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,840
They can just throw it in the trash pile.

510
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,610
The dead little swallow is lying there too.

511
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,430
"Give me the two most precious things

512
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,610
in this city."

513
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,790
One day,

514
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,270
the God said that to one of his angels.

515
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,180
The angel

516
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,610
took the lead and the dead swallow

517
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,160
before the eyes of God.

518
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,790
Good night.

519
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,200
You smell good.

520
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,800
Don't turn off the light. I'm scared.

521
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,930
Fu Jiaming is just sick.

522
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,950
He's in the hospital for treatment.

523
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,090
He'll be fine in a few days.

524
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,830
Do you remember

525
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,160
you once got sick from eating ice cream,

526
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,740
and I took you to the hospital?

527
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,360
It got better in a few days, right?

528
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,800
Fu Jiaming is in the hospital for treatment.

529
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,680
He'll be fine in a few days too.

530
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,530
Will he die then?

531
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,450
Everyone will die.

532
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,680
All life has a beginning and an end.

533
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,450
I will die.

534
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,350
Fu Jiaming will die too.

535
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,090
But we still have a long time.

536
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,280
Mommy, please don't die. I'm scared.

537
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,610
I'm scared too.

538
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,930
That's why we need to live well,

539
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,660
be with the people we love,

540
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,970
do things we love.

541
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,160
Then we won't be afraid, right?

542
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,930
What about Mommy?

543
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,020
Can you stay with me forever?

544
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,090
Of course.

545
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,840
I will always be with you,

546
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,490
and Grandma and Grandpa, and Fu Jiaming.

547
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,220
And Daddy, and Uncle and Auntie.

548
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,060
Yes.

549
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,450
Everyone will be with you.

550
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,610
Mommy, I want to go see Fu Jiaming.

551
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,310
Wait a few days until he's better.

552
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,620
Then I'll take you to see him.

553
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,460
Okay?

554
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,380
Dad,

555
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,150
where's Mom?

556
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,800
At Professor Liang's place.

557
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,670
She's asleep?

558
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,320
Don't you want to persuade me?

559
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,020
Persuade you?

560
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,930
Can you listen?

561
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,640
I want to know what you all think.

562
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,980
Alright.

563
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,130
Since you asked me,

564
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,800
I'll say a few words simply.

565
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,890
We won't kick someone

566
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,640
when they're down.

567
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,890
If you choose to be with him,

568
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,720
we won't interfere.

569
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,270
If

570
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,240
you choose to let go,

571
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,970
we won't call you heartless.

572
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,010
That's human nature.

573
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,680
When you reach our age,

574
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,640
you'll understand.

575
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,270
You

576
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,840
can't fight genetics.

577
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,130
You can't fight human nature.

578
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,160
You can't fight fate.

579
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,890
These years,

580
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,930
you've had it tough,

581
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,030
taking care of us

582
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,130
and the kid.

583
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,530
Thank you.

584
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,240
Live the life you want.

585
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,840
Don't overthink it.

586
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,610
Don't be too responsible.

587
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,320
In this life, to put it plainly,

588
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,410
there are only so many decades.

589
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,870
If the happy times outnumber the tough times,

590
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,130
then your life

591
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,310
is worth it.

592
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,590
Don't be sad.

593
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,720
Honestly,

594
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,840
I miss you being a kid.

595
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,410
So carefree.

596
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,930
Take care of yourself.

597
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,450
There's still a long road ahead.

598
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,240
I believe in you.

599
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,350
Are you Cupid?

600
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,840
What right do you have to oppose?

601
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,360
She's my sister, or I won't meddle.

602
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,700
It's not like high blood pressure or diabetes,

603
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,640
which can be controlled
with injections and medicine.

604
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,310
That's a life-threatening illness.

605
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,390
To put it bluntly,

606
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,530
you never know when he might...

607
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,130
Die?

608
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,320
How many couples

609
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,390
can die together peacefully?

610
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,470
Many relationships don't reach a natural end.

611
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,310
Besides,

612
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,660
it just hit him once.

613
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,270
It's not like it's incurable.

614
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,220
Even if it can be treated,

615
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,830
he's not a healthy person either.

616
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,680
What's the point?

617
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,310
Everyone is born heading towards death.

618
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,150
Shall we die anyway?

619
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,890
I understand this reasoning.

620
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,180
I just can't get over it.

621
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,060
Why do you need to get over it?

622
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,740
That's Rose's job.

623
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,450
You need to leave it to her.

624
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,420
Well.

625
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,360
The psychologist made you broad-minded.

626
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,020
Do you know?

627
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,830
The day you went to see the psychologist,

628
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,610
I was there officiating a wedding.

629
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,970
I couldn't even concentrate properly.

630
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,450
What did the psychologist tell you?

631
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,130
My psychologist said

632
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,240
my privacy shouldn't be disclosed to others.

633
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,240
Keeping a secret from me, huh?

634
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,110
Listen.

635
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,840
The guy outside,

636
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,490
his snoring is in 4/2 rhythm.

637
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,940
Snore.

638
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,900
Breathe.

639
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,110
Snore.

640
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,110
Breathe.

641
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,360
The one inside

642
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,680
is in 3/4 time.

643
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,530
Snore, breathe, and breathe.

644
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,640
It's the rhythm of a waltz.

645
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,420
Huang Yimei,

646
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,970
