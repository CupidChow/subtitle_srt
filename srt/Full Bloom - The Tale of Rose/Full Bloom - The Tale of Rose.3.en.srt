00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,980
Hello?

4
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,540
Hi.

5
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm Amy from Cyan's HR Department.

6
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,580
Congratulations.

7
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,340
You've passed the interview
for our company.

8
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,460
Hello? Are you listening?

9
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,220
Hello?

10
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,820
Hello?

11
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,420
I got the job!

12
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,660
I got it!

13
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,260
I'll be honored

14
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,060
to become a taxpayer

15
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,020
of the People's Republic of China.

16
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,700
Old lady,

17
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,500
admit defeat.

18
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,860
Does getting the job mean you win?

19
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,020
There's still a probation period.

20
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,380
When is the deadline for applying
for the postgraduate entrance exam?

21
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,100
End of October, I think.

22
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,940
- What...
- Still enough time.

23
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,180
What do you mean?

24
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,780
You said you're the assistant
to the general manager.

25
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,220
You've always been

26
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,660
the center of attention since childhood.

27
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,940
Can you handle serving others?

28
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,660
Let's wait and see.

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,340
We'll see the result after three months.

30
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,340
Then I'll raise the stakes.

31
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,460
If I become a regular employee,

32
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,060
you owe me a bag.

33
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,420
No problem.

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,140
If it doesn't work out,

35
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,620
I'll decide on your postgraduate major.

36
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
No objections

37
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,300
or failure can be accepted.

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,740
I won't fail.

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,860
Deal.

40
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,060
Two gamblers.

41
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,540
Let go, let go.

(Cyan Art Center)

43
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,860
Yes. I told you, right?

44
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,180
- Who knew?
- I was so surprised.

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,180
- Exactly.
- Who's this? So pretty.

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,860
Hello.

47
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm Huang Yimei, new here.

48
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,100
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, hello.

49
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,300
Let me take you to your desk.

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
No need, no need.

51
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,460
Okay, then you show me the way.

52
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,060
- Who's this?
- Alright.

53
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,240
Alright, alright.

54
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,740
You're Huang Yimei, right?

55
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,700
Let's have lunch together.

56
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,620
My treat, my treat.

57
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,100
Don't compete with me. It's my treat.

58
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,580
I knew you'd come,
so I've prepared flowers.

59
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,940
Have you had breakfast?

60
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,780
Coffee?

61
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,980
No, no, you're too polite.

62
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,620
- How about an apple?
- No need.

63
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,020
Come on, let's go together.

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,060
- Together, together.
- Okay, okay.

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,180
Let's go together. My treat.

66
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,380
My treat, my treat.

67
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,980
- My treat.
- Listen up, everyone.

(Cyan Art Center)

69
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,980
Ms. Su.

70
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,580
You're here.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,540
Go to the HR Department first
to register.

72
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,320
Process your entry procedures
and get your work card.

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,980
Then go find the colleague
in charge of the system

74
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,180
to get your employee ID and email.

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,980
Should I say hi to Ms. Jiang first?

76
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,640
She's on a business trip today.

77
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,140
I've prepared myself to face the tiger.

78
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,340
But the tiger isn't home.

79
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,700
You're very beautiful.

80
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,330
Being beautiful is an advantage.

81
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,660
But being as beautiful as you are

82
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,980
could be an advantage

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,540
or a hindrance.

84
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,020
In the future,
you'll encounter many difficulties.

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,300
But you must remember

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,410
to tackle them immediately.

87
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,300
Don't show weakness,

88
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,980
because showing weakness
could mean taking sides,

89
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,260
and taking sides could make you
a target for others.

90
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,420
This is the document room
and also a storage room.

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,780
All the project documents and backups

92
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,820
from the past are here.

93
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,780
You'll get familiar with them
starting from this year.

94
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,340
The meeting room.

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,420
Before every meeting in the future,

96
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,220
you'll need to prepare meeting materials

97
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,140
and multimedia materials.

98
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,460
Can you drive?

99
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,020
I have a license
but haven't driven much.

100
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,460
This is your seat.

101
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,260
It's closest to Tina's office.

102
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,300
If she calls you,

103
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,600
you need to respond to her immediately.

104
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,490
The first thing you should do
when coming to the office

105
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,260
is tidy up Tina's office.

106
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,900
Her deliveries will go through you first.

107
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,380
After sorting them,
hand them over to her.

108
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,840
About the documents on the desk,

109
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,220
the ones on the left are signed,

110
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,500
and the ones on the right are pending.

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,820
- Don't mix them up.
- Okay.

112
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,900
Come here.

113
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,980
Do you usually drink?

114
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Not much.

115
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,420
Not drinking is fine too,

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,520
but you need to understand wine.

117
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,780
Remember all the wines in this cabinet.

118
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
If any bottle is missing, replace it.

119
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,660
They're in the storage room.

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,220
Wine is vital for Tina.

121
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,460
If she works overtime,

122
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,780
she'll need whiskey.

123
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,660
If she drinks too much at a social event,

124
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,660
she'll definitely have a brandy
the next morning.

125
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,300
This is called the reviving liquor.

126
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
If you see her drinking

127
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,860
during working hours,

128
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,820
be careful.

129
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,370
She'll start scolding people.

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,460
She does that?

131
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,860
(Bai Xiaohe)

132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,660
Hello.

133
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,420
I'm Huang Zhenhua.

135
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,860
Hello.

136
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,060
I'm Bai Xiaohe.

137
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,540
I got your contact information

138
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,900
from Professor Liang.

139
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,020
If it's not inconvenient,

140
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,100
can we chat via text first?

141
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,780
Sure.

142
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,180
I heard you're doing a PhD.

143
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,660
Yes.

144
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,780
Must be tough.

145
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,140
It is.

146
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,780
She's really reticent.

147
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,820
You have a nice name.

148
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,980
The moment when a lotus sticks out,

149
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,700
a dragonfly is standing on it.

150
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,020
It sounds like
you're elegant and beautiful,

151
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,180
like a lotus emerging from water.

152
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,580
That's not what my name means.

153
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,380
Do you know
what Mr. Teng is doing in Beijing?

154
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,420
I don't know.

155
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,740
Why did you come to boast then?

156
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,540
He's attending an event

157
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,860
at the China World Hotel.

158
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,900
Then let me arrange it.

159
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,950
Arrange what?

160
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,900
Fengcai International

161
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,260
has been our rival for many years.

162
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,340
Don't you know that?

163
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,260
I can't even get in,

164
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,220
including the familiar faces like you.

165
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,740
Then what should we do?

166
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,860
You're asking me that?

167
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,180
Did I hire you

168
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,620
to ask me questions?

169
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,460
Go and find solutions, understand?

170
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,300
Get out!

171
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,020
My lucky color today is red,

172
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,900
and my unlucky color is yellow.

173
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,180
How dare you flaunt yellow
in front of me?

174
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,700
Huang Yimei!

175
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,740
Ms. Jiang.

176
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,660
Get me an emergency appointment
at the hospital.

177
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,740
What's wrong?

178
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,060
My blood sugar is low. Where's my food?

179
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
My lucky color today is red,

180
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,940
and my unlucky color is yellow.

181
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,100
How dare you flaunt yellow
in front of me?

182
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,180
Who is Mr. Teng?

183
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,260
Why is he so hard to meet?

184
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,940
He's a famous mysterious collector.

185
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,740
This year's China-France Culture Fair

186
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,790
includes a Masters Exhibition
and Future Masters Exhibition,

187
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,660
which we're co-organizing

188
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
with another company.

189
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,440
Mr. Teng has several collections

190
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,860
that Tina is very fond of.

191
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,660
If he's willing to lend them to us,

192
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,340
any one of them could be the highlight.

193
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,540
But his personal information
is very limited.

194
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
He doesn't speak Chinese,

195
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,890
and his schedule is very unpredictable,
making it hard to meet him.

196
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,860
Why are you asking about it?

197
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,140
This isn't your job.

198
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,500
Have you read
all the materials I gave you?

199
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,860
Each level has its own tasks.

200
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,020
Don't aim too high.

201
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,660
Didn't you say
if the boss has any requirements,

202
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,100
we should respond immediately?

203
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,700
This is for you.

204
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,700
What are you doing?

205
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,060
I warned you
on the first day at the company.

206
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,900
Don't take sides.

207
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,980
Not even mine.

208
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,300
I'm not taking sides.

209
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,780
It's about reciprocity.

210
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
No, thank you.

211
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,260
I can't afford expensive things now.

212
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,660
I'll buy you a better one

213
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,820
when I get a promotion and raise.

214
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,540
What's this for?

215
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,980
(Fengcai International)

216
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,020
(Charmer over the Years: 2001
Fengcai International Collection Event to Open)

217
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,500
Hello, Madam. This is a greeting card,

218
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,380
not an invitation.

219
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,060
Sorry, this is...

220
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I brought the invitation.

221
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,260
Where is it?

222
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,220
Let me see.

223
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,060
Wait a moment.

224
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,260
Hello, Madam.
If you don't have an invitation,

225
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,340
you're not allowed to enter.

226
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,380
My friend is inside.

227
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,500
Could you make an exception?

228
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,820
Then you can call your friend

229
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,860
to come down and pick you up.

230
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,820
Hey, come pick me up.

231
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,740
They won't let me in.

232
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,340
(Charmer over the Years)

233
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,580
Hello, sir. This is...

234
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,740
She's my friend.

235
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,980
Okay, please come in.

236
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,540
- Why are you arresting me?
- You're really good.

237
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,700
Came here to steal the client, huh?

238
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,580
You hurt me.

239
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,300
Open your eyes wider.

240
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,660
There might be

241
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,700
others doing the same thing.

242
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,500
Hurry up.

243
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,860
Hey, Miss Zhao.

244
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm here.

245
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,540
Did you see me?

246
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,860
I saw you.

247
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,700
Miss Zhao.

248
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,500
Sorry.

249
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,360
You have to work overtime now.

250
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,300
It's okay.

251
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,140
I work in sales, available all day.

252
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
You want to book a banquet hall, right?

253
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,940
Yes, our event on the 3rd of next month

254
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,500
requires early setup of the venue.

255
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,660
Any requirements for the scale?

256
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,260
We have several banquet halls here,

257
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,540
with different sizes and rents.

258
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,500
It depends on your needs.

259
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,260
Our event isn't large in scale

260
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,460
but it's high-end.

261
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,460
So we need to check it out beforehand.

262
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,380
No problem.

263
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,900
Let me show you a smaller one first.

264
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,100
Please, this way.

265
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Miss Huang, this way.

266
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,060
This is the West Hall we just saw.

267
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,500
I'll show you the East Hall.

268
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,580
Okay.

269
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,620
This one is larger.

270
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,860
Come in, please.

271
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,940
How is it?

272
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,860
How big is this hall?

273
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,890
Does it have any requirements
or restrictions

274
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,300
for venue setup?

275
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,580
The ceiling height is 6 meters,

276
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,460
with an area of 40 by 24 meters.

277
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,100
It can accommodate 40 standard tables.

278
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Without the partitions,
the area will increase.

279
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,590
We can also divide it
into four smaller halls

280
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,660
according to your needs.

281
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,980
Rest assured about the venue setup.

282
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,660
It'll be handled by a professional team.

283
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,530
Of course.

284
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,020
We can also design

285
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,500
based on your special requirements.

286
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,100
The size of this hall is fine,

287
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,540
but these two halls are connected,

288
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,260
sharing a corridor outside.

289
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,140
We need to clear the space
on the event day.

290
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,300
I see.

291
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,580
There's a separate hall upstairs,

292
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,940
but unluckily,

293
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,020
it's currently in use.

294
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,260
I'll just take a look around.

295
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,340
Miss Huang, wait a moment.

296
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
They have security,
so you can't enter like this.

297
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,300
Let's not take the elevator.

298
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,540
I'll take you through the staff passage.

299
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,740
This way, please.

300
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,540
Here, Miss Huang.

301
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,380
Here.

302
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
By the way, Miss Huang,

303
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,340
this hall occupies an entire floor,

304
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,580
so the price isn't as favorable.

305
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,580
Price is not an issue.

306
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,460
How do you usually invoice?

307
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,200
It will be invoiced as a venue rental fee.

308
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,220
It's for business, right?

309
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,340
It will be clearly stated in the contract.

310
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,180
Don't worry.

311
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,460
Okay.

312
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,340
Please, this way, Miss Huang.

313
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,180
Okay.

314
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,620
- Please, come in.
- Alright.

315
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,380
This hall is nice.

316
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,780
You can't enter.

317
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,020
Well,

318
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,500
when can you make a decision?

319
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,420
Prepare the contract as soon as possible.

320
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,780
I'll get the boss to sign it right away.

321
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,340
Where is the restroom?

322
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,940
It's right here.

323
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,780
I'll go with you.

324
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,500
No need, I can go by myself.

325
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,860
Thank you.

326
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Hey, Miss Zhao.

327
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,820
Yes, I'm already outside.

328
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,980
I didn't see you.

329
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,060
Then I'll leave first.

330
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,500
Thank you today. See you next time.

331
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,260

Excuse me, sir.

394

I'm Rosie from Cyan Art.

395
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,020
Nice to meet you.

396
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,780
I know you have
an extremely tight schedule,

397
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,900
so I have to make my way to meet you.

398
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,340
Interesting.

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,660

What can I do for you?

402
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,300
Actually, my boss, Tina,

403
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,500
she's arranging

404
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,180
an exhibition
for the China-France Culture Fair,

405
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,220
so she really wishes to display
your collection at the fair.

406
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,060
I was wondering
if it's possible for her to meet you.

407
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,620
Eric.

408
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,260
I have to go now. Contact me by phone.

409
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,100
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

410
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,340
You're not Mr. Teng.

411
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,300
I didn't say I was Mr. Teng.

412
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,040
You think peaking English

413
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,860
makes it easier to deceive people, right?

414
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Why would I deceive you?

415
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,580
Sir, hello.

416
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,300
Mr. Teng is asking for you.

417
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,780
Okay, thank you.

418
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,620
Aren't you looking for Mr. Teng?

419
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,260
Follow me.

420
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Wait a moment.

421
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,740
This is your drink.

422
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,580
Thank you.

423
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,940
The lady over there
has been looking for you.

424
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,460
Her boss hopes

425
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,100
to exhibit your collection
at the China-France Culture Fair.

426
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,580
It's the event you mentioned?

427
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,420
Yes.

428
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,260
Is she your business partner?

429
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,780
No.

430
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,740
It's an interesting coincidence.

431
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,140
Perhaps

432
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,020
you can talk to her.

433
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,140
Okay, sure.

434
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,300
Hi, nice to meet you, sir.

435
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

436
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,060
Who is your boss?

437
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,540
Who is your boss,
and how should I address her?

438
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,020
Tina Jiang, Jiang Xueqiong.

439
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,380
My Chinese friend
seems to have mentioned her.

440
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,700
But I'm sorry.

441
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,260
I'm heading to Hong Kong, China tonight.

442
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,220
I'm afraid
I won't have a chance to meet her.

443
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,580
I've heard about her
from my Chinese friend,

444
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,100
but I'm leaving for Hong Kong, China tonight

445
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,230
and probably won't make it to see her.

446
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,700
Can I buy you a drink?

447
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,580
This is what I said to you.

448
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,540
Can I buy you a drink?

449
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,060
I just need half an hour.

450
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,820
This is what I said to Mr. Teng.

451
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,660
Can she buy you a drink?

452
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,580
Okay, sure.

453
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,620
Okay.

454
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,340
Hey.

455
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,380
Ms. Jiang,

456
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,220
you need to come
to the China World Hotel right away,

457
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,420
within half an hour.

458
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,100
Who is the assistant here?

459
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,820
Mr. Teng is right next to me now.

460
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,500
He can only spare you half an hour.

461
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,620
Coming.

462
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,620
It's quite bold for us to meet this way

463
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,940
for the first time.

464
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,700
But I really didn't expect

465
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,540
you would

466
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,300
agree to meet us.

467
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,980
It's quite bold for us to meet this way

468
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,220
for the first time.

469
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
I find it rather interesting.

470
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,430
- Pineapple and ginger soda.
- Thank you.

471
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,060
Your assistant is very clever

472
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,180
and bold.

473
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,100
I find it rather interesting.

474
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,940
Your assistant is very clever

475
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,100
and bold.

476
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,700
But this is our first meeting after all.

477
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,700
I cannot easily agree
to many requests of yours.

478
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,980
But this is our first meeting after all.

479
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,580
I cannot easily agree
to many requests of yours.

480
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,780
I hope you can understand.

481
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,740
Of course, I totally understand.

482
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,980
Trust is very important.

483
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,780
But I believe in the near future,

484
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,220
you will come to understand more

485
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,020
and trust Cyan more.

486
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,780
Of course.

487
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,540
Trust is very important.

488
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,180
But I believe in the near future,

489
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,280
you will come to understand more

490
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,220
and trust Cyan more.

491
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,700
I admire your confidence.

492
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,140
I admire your confidence.

493
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,060
Thank you.

494
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,620
Hello.

495
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,020
Could I buy you a drink?

496
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,620
Sorry, I'm with my boss.

497
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,100
It's okay.

498
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,020
Then I can wait with you for her.

499
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,700
Kenny, it's almost time.

500
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,860
Okay.

501
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,900
You do know a lot about my collection.

502
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,540
I'm about to leave for the airport.

503
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,720
Let's exchange contact information.

504
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,260
Can we exchange contact information?

505
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,340
Sure, sure.

506
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,020
Sorry, we...

507
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,580
Okay.

508
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,580
Can I buy you a drink now?

509
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,820
Thank you.

510
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,220
Providing alcoholic beverages to minors

511
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,500
is illegal.

512
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Do you really believe it?

513
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,460
Thank you for your help today.

514
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,580
Just a small favor.

515
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,540
I heard earlier

516
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,540
you're organizing this year's
China-France Culture Fair.

517
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,380
Yes.

518
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,820
Could there be a chance

519
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,380
for us to cooperate in the future?

520
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Huang Yimei, hurry and take me home.

521
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,860
Thank you.

522
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,180
Boss!

523
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,020
Nice to meet you.

524
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,100
Ms. Jiang,

525
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,820
are you sure I should drive?

526
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,300
I've hardly driven before.

527
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,420
Just drive.

528
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,740
Okay.

529
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,700
If you dare to ride with me,

530
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,020
I dare to drive.

531
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,900
Ms. Jiang, are you okay?

532
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,940
You don't look so good.

533
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,420
Take me home.

534
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,740
Okay.

535
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,180
Sure.

536
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,340
Hey, do you even know how to drive?

538
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,900
Ms. Jiang,

539
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,460
are you feeling unwell?

540
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

541
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,580
I told you to take me home.

542
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,410
Can't you understand human language?

543
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,300
I know. I know.

544
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,380
I'm fine. I just want to go home, okay?

545
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,020
No.

546
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,140
This isn't the way to my house.

547
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,700
Where are you taking me?

548
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
To the hospital.

549
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,020
Huang Yimei,
I told you I want to go home.

550
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
I just need a cup of hot water.

551
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,060
No need for the hospital.

552
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,420
I command you

553
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,900
to take me home right now.

554
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,620
I'm sorry, Ms. Jiang.

555
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,340
It's a matter of life and death.

556
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,940
Even if you want to fire me,

557
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,660
you should fire me at the hospital.

558
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,980
(Emergency)

559
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,700
- I'm not going.
- Come on.

560
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,820
Let's go.

561
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,100
I want to go home.
I won't go to the hospital.

562
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,660
Tina, Tina.

563
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,460
Where are you going? I want to go home.

564
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,900
- Let's go.
- What's wrong?

565
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,170
(Emergency Room)
Her stomach hurts.

566
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,340
Hello?

567
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,580
Ms. Su, Tina and I are at the hospital.

568
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,380
Can you come over?

569
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,980
Send me the address. I'll come over now.

570
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,900
Check the patient's blood pressure.

571
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,700
Thank you.

572
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,740
The doctor said
she has a chronic gastric ulcer.

573
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,060
She only had salad for dinner tonight

574
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,780
- and drank a lot of alcohol.
- Yeah.

575
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,600
The doctor said you brought her in time.

576
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,230
Otherwise,
it would have been troublesome.

577
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,300
You can leave now dressed like this.

578
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,180
I'll stay.

579
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,300
Why?

580
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,740
Reimbursements.

581
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,660
For Tina's personal expenses,

582
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,860
ask her when she wakes up.

583
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,260
For the company's part,

584
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,060
go through the reimbursement process.

585
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,460
How do I get home without money?

586
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,300
Do I look like I brought my purse?

587
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,220
(Emergency)

588
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,860
Isn't your supervisor going too far?

589
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,340
This counts as overtime for you.

590
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,220
Can't she lend you money for a taxi?

591
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,860
Making me drive here at night.

592
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,180
She said she didn't bring any.

593
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,940
Okay.

594
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,940
I believe you.

595
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,980
Culture companies are different.

596
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,300
You're dressed for overtime
like walking on the red carpet.

597
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,220
Another reticent one.

598
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,500
I think you're doing a great job.

599
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,980
Hello, Mr. Teng's drink.

600
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,180
Aren't you looking for Mr. Teng?

601
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,940
Follow me.

602
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,300
I find it rather interesting.

603
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,220
Your assistant is very clever

604
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,380
and bold.

605
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,780
It's quite bold for us to meet this way

606
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,100
for the first time.

607
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,580
I should have asked for his number.

608
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,180
Who are you talking about?

609
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,100
I have her number.

610
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,540
What's the use of a phone number?

611
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,700
Zhenhua,

612
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,820
are you dating again?

613
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,060
Mom introduced me to a female PhD.

614
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm not taking the entrance exam,

615
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,060
so she introduced you to a PhD.

616
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,020
She's determined to raise our family's

617
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,780
average education level to a master's.

618
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,700
It seems like she didn't like me.

619
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,020
We've been texting for a few days.

620
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,180
I'm enthusiastic,

621
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,860
but the total number of words
she replied with

622
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,460
is not even enough
for a five-character quatrain.

623
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,460
Why not meet in person?

624
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,620
I don't know how to arrange a meeting.

625
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,020
Give me your phone.

626
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,900
Don't mess around. Keep it simple.

627
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,860
Done.

628
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,380
How did you ask her?

629
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,980
I just suggested a meeting.

630
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,220
She said okay and asked which day.

631
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,540
I said you're off tomorrow.

632
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,460
- Go then.
- That's it?

633
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,940
Amazing.

634
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,020
Let me treat you to dinner.

635
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,060
Anything you like.

636
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,940
Zhenhua,

637
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,940
I'm thirsty.

638
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,580
What do you want to drink?
I'll buy it now.

639
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,060
Sorry, we...

640
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,660
Okay.

641
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,460
I heard earlier

642
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,420
you're organizing this year's
China-France Culture Fair.

643
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,260
Yes.

644
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,700
Could there be a chance

645
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,300
for us to cooperate in the future?

646
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,860
Huang Yimei, hurry and take me home.

647
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,940
(School of Chemistry)

648
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,500
Ms...

649
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,780
(Do not open the door with gloves on.)

650
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,100
I'm Huang Zhenhua.

651
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,740
Wait for me a moment.

652
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,020
Okay, okay.

653
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,860
Xiaohe, right?

654
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,420
I'm Huang Zhenhua.

655
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,380
Hello, I'm Bai Xiaohe.

656
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,220
Hello.

657
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,620
What research topic are you working on?

658
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,700
I'm studying

659
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,380
the synthesis of deoxyhemoglobin

660
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,100
and exploring its different

661
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,620
absorption mechanisms with hemoglobin

662
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,260
for different wavelengths of light.

663
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,100
Among what you said,

664
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,540
I could only understand"protein".

665
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,980
Since you mentioned protein,

666
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,380
I got a bit hungry.

667
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,020
How about we go for lunch together?

668
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,380
Where do you want to go?

669
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,420
The cafeteria.

670
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,460
Okay.

671
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,540
Let me change my clothes first.

672
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,660
Sure. Go ahead.

673
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,620
(City Diary)

674
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,140
(Exhibition Plan)

675
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,900
(Flow Season, Exhibition Plan,
Planner: Huang Yimei)

676
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,220
(Sour Cabbage Chicken Noodle Soup)

677
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,820
What do you like to eat?

678
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,020
Do you have any dietary restrictions?

679
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,900
No, anything is fine.

680
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,900
Some girls don't like fatty meat.

681
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,460
Some don't eat onions, ginger, or garlic.

682
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,340
I'm not picky. Anything is fine.

683
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,460
Then I'll just order randomly.

684
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,300
Okay.

685
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,620
Fried Crispy Meat.

686
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,620
Fish Soup with Sour Cabbage.

687
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Stir-fried Shrimp
with Cashew and Celery.

688
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
And Potato Beef.

689
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,340
Another one.

690
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,220
Don't order too much.
We can't finish them all.

691
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,660
It'll be a waste.

692
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,820
Another vegetable dish?

693
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,660
- Okay.
- Another vegetable dish.

694
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,500
And rice.

695
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,980
Is rice okay?

696
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,380
Sure.

697
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,260
Let's go over there.

698
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,660
Okay.

699
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,340
Let's sit there.

700
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,560
Alright.

701
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,420
Sure.

702
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,100
Wait a moment.

703
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,900
It's all greasy.

704
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,860
It's fine. It's already old.

705
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,980
Well...

706
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,180
It's quite expensive.

707
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,100
It should be cherished.

708
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,820
Things are meant to be used.

709
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,020
Being too concerned about them

710
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,820
makes people slaves to objects.

711
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,980
Makes sense.

712
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I was being stingy.

713
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,620
I was being stingy.

714
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,660
I brought you to eat at the cafeteria.

715
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,500
Hope you don't mind.

716
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,140
I have experiments to do
in the afternoon,

717
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,340
so I'm a bit pressed for time.

718
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,260
I don't mind.
I often come to this cafeteria.

719
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,820
It feels like home. It's cozy.

720
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,060
That's good.

721
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
Here, try this.

722
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,540
Beef.

723
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,500
Thank you.

724
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,340
You're welcome.
