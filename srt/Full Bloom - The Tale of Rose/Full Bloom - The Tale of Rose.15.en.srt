Be my girlfriend.

Reply 1 to agree.

Reply 2 to disagree.

8
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,500
Hello?

9
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,890
Come and see me.

10
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,260
Okay.

11
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,380
Why haven't you gone home?

12
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,450
Come, have a drink with me.

13
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,170
Today

14
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,540
has been so exhausting.

15
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,940
How are you?

16
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,380
Did your trip home go well?

17
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,330
Same as always.

18
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,940
Well,

19
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,820
you've worked with me for so many years.

20
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,660
I know your situation.

21
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,470
Though I can't promote you
or raise your salary

22
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,890
just because you have difficulties,

23
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,950
if you need money, you must...

24
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,570
I don't need it.

25
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,820
If money can solve it,
it's not a real problem.

26
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,010
You're like this.

27
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,380
You hate owing people favors.

28
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,820
Right, Su?

29
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,500
What did you say?

30
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,410
Su.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,870
What's wrong?

32
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,570
Only Huang Yimei can call you like that?

33
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,500
No.

34
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,530
It's kind of funny

35
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,380
when you say it.

36
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,280
Su, Su, Su.

37
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,740
No, it really doesn't suit you. Stop it.

38
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Drink up.

39
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,450
It's too weird.

40
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,010
People need

41
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,140
to work hard

42
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,140
but also enjoy life.

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,180
Come on.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,650
Have a drink.

45
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,210
You keep

46
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,770
everything inside.

47
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,820
Sometimes you need

48
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,500
to relax

49
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,140
and open up.

50
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,940
Got it.

51
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,410
You're pretty good at dancing.

52
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,140
Didn't know

53
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,380
you could dance.

54
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,520
Next time we go out,

55
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,330
I'll take you dancing.

56
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,760
I sent the text days ago.

57
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,410
She must have seen it by now.

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,450
Su

59
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,640
is like a cat.

60
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,500
She seems independent and aloof,

61
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,060
but once you get to know her, you realize

62
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,760
if she doesn't dislike you,

63
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,090
it means she likes you.

64
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,990
What does that mean?

65
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,890
If she likes me, why hasn't she replied?

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
You've known her for so long.
Don't you get her?

67
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,860
Forget about that.

68
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,160
Tell me.

69
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,550
Could my text have scared her off?

70
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,190
Is she ignoring me now?

71
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,970
Give her some time.

72
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,700
There's no time left.

73
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,970
Why are you here?

74
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,620
Come in.

75
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,410
Have you been drinking?

76
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,010
A little.

77
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,140
About the text

78
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,770
a few days ago.

79
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,260
Is it

80
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,450
"yes"

81
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,180
or

82
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,410
"yes"?

83
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,140
No.

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,010
Why not?

85
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,510
We've known each other for so long.

86
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,870
We've had our fights and good times.

87
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,180
We even did that a few days ago.

88
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,970
I thought it was great too.

89
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,390
Do you think
there's something wrong with me?

90
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,500
I was sexually assaulted before.

91
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,100
My stepfather

92
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,690
raped me

93
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,650
when I was

94
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,770
sixteen years old.

95
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,650
Who is it?

96
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,010
Mom!

97
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,480
Mom!

98
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,170
Get away from me!

99
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,260
Don't come closer!

100
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,980
Let go of me! Let go!

101
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,770
Let go of me!

102
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,530
You asked me

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,140
how I got the scar on my arm, right?

104
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,810
It happened that night.

105
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,860
It damaged the nerves.

106
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,650
It took a long time to heal.

107
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,750
I told my mom about it.

108
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,260
She didn't believe me.

109
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,380
She scolded me

110
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,170
and accused me of being seductive.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,890
Nonsense!

112
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,380
You're lying! Shameless!

113
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,620
You did nothing wrong.

114
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,580
Of course, I did nothing wrong.

115
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,530
I don't need sympathy.

116
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,290
I also

117
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,810
don't need men.

118
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,170
That's just how I am.

119
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,040
If you can handle it,

120
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,840
we can continue being friends.

121
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,290
If not,

122
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,930
delete my number.

123
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,530
Our son hasn't been himself lately.

124
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,190
He hasn't been around for days

125
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,670
and doesn't call.

126
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,220
What could he be doing?

127
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,630
Zhenhua often has to entertain clients
with his superiors.

128
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,480
The work on the project is complicated.

129
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,380
He must be busy.

130
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,340
Yes.

131
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,000
Being busy with work
and ignoring us is normal.

132
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,240
But last weekend, when he came home,

133
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,790
his hair was a mess.

134
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,170
He seemed absent-minded all the time

135
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,510
and hard of hearing.

136
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,340
I found it hard for him to respond to me.

137
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,290
Something must be wrong.

138
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,480
Don't worry.
What could possibly be wrong?

139
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
He suddenly blurted out

140
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,290
during dinner,

141
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,930
"The beauty of Venus
lies in her imperfection."

142
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,400
What's that supposed to mean?

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,530
Is he thinking of self-harm?

144
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm not hungry. I just ate something.

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,890
Then eat later.

146
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,050
Pizza?

147
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,810
Are you Huang Yimei?

148
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,400
Well, we'll be going now.

149
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,530
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

150
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm Hu Lin,

151
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,290
like Lin in Guan Zhilin.

152
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,100
I'm Fang Xiewen's girlfriend.

153
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,890
Do you need something?

154
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,010
How did you two meet?

155
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,930
How long have you known each other?

156
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,770
I'm talking to you.

157
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,590
I've known Fang Xiewen for two years.

158
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,530
I understand him.

159
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,790
He's helpful,

160
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,040
so please have some boundaries

161
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,740
and stay away from my boyfriend, okay?

162
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,890
I'm talking...

163
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,100
Let go.

164
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,220
Tiny.

165
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,500
Tiny, be good.

166
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,580
I'll find a place and move out soon.

167
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,410
Hi, I'm Fang Xiewen

168
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,750
from the Computer Science Department.

169
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,890
I know who you are.

170
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,740
May I ask

171
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,000
how Huang Yimei is doing lately?

172
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,170
You still have the nerve to ask.

173
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,140
Your girlfriend Hu Lin came to see her.

174
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,670
Since you have a girlfriend,

175
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,980
stay away from Huang Yimei.

176
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,290
Huang,

177
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,170
let me explain.

178
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,170
This...

179
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,690
This isn't what you think.

180
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,770
That girl...

181
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,980
Su,

182
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,460
I haven't received your emails
for a long time.

183
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,530
How have you been?

184
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,020
(Inbox)

185
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,540
I don't know what happened
between you and my brother.

186
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,170
Neither of you want to tell me.

187
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,890
(Outbox)
The problem has always been with me.

188
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,780
He just happened

189
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,410
to see my dark side.

190
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,760
Everyone, please submit everything

191
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,890
by the end of this week, okay?

192
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,490
Go on.

193
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,300
Everyone has a dark side,

194
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,540
but that has nothing to do with feelings.

195
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,200
Everything you mentioned

196
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,340
is about what you can't

197
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,620
or shouldn't do,

198
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,300
not what you don't want to do.

199
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,300
Su,

200
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,450
talk to my brother.

201
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
Even if it can't be resolved,

202
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,670
at least give him an answer.

203
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,940
Good for you.

204
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,500
Showing up unannounced
in this cold weather.

205
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,140
You've never lived alone.

206
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,300
How could I be at ease?

207
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,020
I'm here to help you tidy up.

208
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,460
Tidy up what?

209
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,580
I'll move out in a couple of days.

210
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,020
Didn't you just move in?

211
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,260
Where are you moving?

212
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,230
You must be Mrs. Huang, right?

213
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,980
- Hello.
- Mrs. Huang, let me help you.

214
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,340
No need. You're too kind.

215
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,420
Careful.

216
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,260
Let me help, Mrs. Huang.

217
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,860
Thank you, young man.

218
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,550
What's your name?

219
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,260
Mrs. Huang, I'm Fang Xiewen.

220
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,620
I live here too.

221
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm also studying at Fudan.

222
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,060
I was just worried about Rose living alone.

223
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,020
I'm relieved for her
to have a familiar neighbor.

224
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,340
You can rest assured, Mrs. Huang.

225
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,940
Up here.

226
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,420
Here we are.

227
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,440
Thank you, thank you.

228
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,700
- I'll take it.
- Mrs. Huang, it's really okay.

229
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,060
- I'll take it.
- It's okay. Let me. You're too kind.

230
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
You don't need to be so polite.

231
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,780
Thank you. It's fine. Thank you.

232
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,740
Alright, come in.

233
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,340
Mrs. Huang,

234
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,540
if you need anything, just let me know.

235
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Mom,

236
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,060
don't trouble him.

237
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,380
What's he done to you?

238
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
Nothing.

239
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
I don't want any misunderstandings.

240
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,260
Tiny.

241
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,020
Tiny, come here.

242
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,420
Tiny, come here.

243
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,940
- I'll hold you.
- Mom, what did you bring?

244
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
It's so heavy.

245
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,100
All your favorite foods.

246
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,940
Come on, I'll hold you.

247
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,380
Alright.

248
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,300
Come on, Grandma brought you some meat.

249
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,340
- Eat meat, come on.
- Say Grandma.

250
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,020
Look. I brought you some food.

251
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,820
Mom,

252
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,740
if my brother has children,
you'll definitely spoil them.

253
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,620
Why does it have to be your brother's?

254
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,740
Can't it be yours?

255
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm not getting married.

256
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Where would I get a child?

257
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,020
Don't think about love again, huh?

258
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,660
Indeed.

259
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,860
What's going on with your brother and Su?

260
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,940
Whenever I ask,

261
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,740
your brother's face turns pale as a sheet.

262
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,940
Did Su say anything to you?

263
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,820
Mom,

264
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,700
if they don't want to tell us,
we shouldn't ask.

265
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,260
Mom, I have classes this afternoon.

266
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,220
You should take a nap.

267
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,180
Turn on the electric blanket.

268
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,140
Okay, you go ahead.

269
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,940
Don't worry about me.

270
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,020
Okay, you go.

271
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,580
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

272
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,540
Hi, doing housework?

273
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,100
Hi.

274
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,340
Mrs. Huang, are you going out?

275
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm going to buy some groceries.

276
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,260
I was about to go shopping too.

277
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,180
I'll go with you.

278
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,500
No need, I know the way. It's close.

279
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,980
It's no trouble, Mrs. Huang.
I'll accompany you.

280
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,340
Wait a moment.

281
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,300
Mrs. Huang.

282
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,540
These vegetables are quite fresh.

283
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,940
Yes, they are very fresh.

284
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
How much are these vegetables?

285
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,540
These are 0.4 yuan for half a kilo.

286
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,380
0.4 yuan for half a kilo.

287
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,980
And these tomatoes?

288
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,140
These are 0.5 yuan for half a kilo.

289
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,620
- 0.5 yuan.
- 0.5 yuan for half a kilo.

290
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,660
That's good. I'll take a few.

291
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,340
- Okay.
- Three should be enough.

292
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,140
- Alright.
- Okay, thanks.

293
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,200
Do you need these as well, Mrs. Huang?

294
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,820
- Yes, this too.
- Okay.

295
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,700
Here, take this as well.

296
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,140
Alright, okay.

297
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,500
Yes, this one too. Let me see.

298
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,140
Celery is good too. Very fresh.

299
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,540
Fry some celery later.

300
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,140
- Celery is 0.6 yuan for half a kilo.
- How much is this?

301
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,060
0.6 yuan for half a kilo.

302
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,380
0.6 yuan.

303
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,860
Well,

304
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,580
0.6 yuan.

305
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,540
Okay, I'll take some.

306
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:08,980
Alright.

307
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,220
Weigh them together.

308
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,220
The total is 2.4 yuan.

309
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,860
- Okay, 2.4 yuan.
- How much? No, no, no.

310
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,100
- No need.
- I'll pay myself.

311
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,900
I don't need your money.

312
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,740
- No, no, no.
- Don't be so polite, Mrs. Huang.

313
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,500
It's fine.

314
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,460
Here.

315
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Take 2.4 yuan.

316
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,380
No need to be so polite.

317
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,300
Having you come with me
is already enough.

318
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,500
Really, thank you.

319
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

320
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,070
- Put them in the basket.
- Put them in the basket.

321
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,700
Here, here.

322
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,620
Here you go, together.

323
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,020
- Alright.
- Okay.

324
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,220
Careful.

325
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,420
I have a tissue, Mrs. Huang.

326
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,980
Oh, you do?

327
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,060
You're very thoughtful.

328
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,980
Here you go. 9 yuan.

329
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,380
9 yuan. That's good.

330
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,340
Alright.

331
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,740
Here you go.

332
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,060
I'll make braised pork for you tonight.

333
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,620
That's great, Mrs. Huang.

334
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
I'll carry this.

335
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,500
- It's heavy.
- No need.

336
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,700
You've already accompanied me shopping
and helped me carry them.

337
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,820
Thank you very much.

338
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,700
No problem, Mrs. Huang.

339
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,340
Mrs. Huang,

340
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,220
I think Huang
has some misunderstandings about me,

341
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,380
but I haven't had the chance to explain.

342
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,500
My daughter

343
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,660
has that kind of temperament.

344
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,740
She's full of thorns.

345
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,420
Please bear with her.

346
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,700
She'll be fine eventually.

347
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,380
It's okay.

348
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
I actually think

349
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,540
Huang has a pretty good temper.

350
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,700
Really?

351
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Well, if you say so.

352
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,740
Adding vinegar is a good way
to remove the smell.

353
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,900
If we sprinkle some chopped green onions,
it will be perfect.

354
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Wait a moment, Mrs. Huang.

355
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,020
I have green onions.

356
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,420
See? Homegrown green onions.

357
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,340
Take as much as you need.

358
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,460
Just one stalk is enough.

359
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,580
Here you go, one stalk.

360
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,740
Yes, these small green onions.

361
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,580
My daughter's room also has a vase

362
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,740
similar to this one.

363
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,900
This vase was a gift from her to me.

364
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,700
But I'm not as elegant as she is.

365
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,060
I don't arrange flowers.

366
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,540
I can only grow some green onions.

367
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,300
Green onions are still something.

368
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,980
I think they are better
than her wildflowers.

369
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,700
More practical.

370
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,780
Mrs. Huang, can we take
the black fungus out now?

371
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,460
Yes.

372
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,020
Drain the water

373
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,140
and we'll fry them later.

374
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,860
Alright.

375
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,260
Fang,

376
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,740
have dinner with us later.

377
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,820
I'll help explain things to her.

378
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,060
Okay.

379
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,020
Dinner is ready.

380
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,220
Having dinner early today?

381
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,260
Yes.

382
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,940
So many delicious dishes.

383
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,260
Hurry, wash your hands, and eat.

384
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,780
- Smells good.
- Go wash your hands.

385
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,460
Alright.

386
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,020
Hurry, hurry.

387
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,660
Fang, come up and eat.

388
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,660
Okay, Mrs. Huang.

389
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,700
Come in.

390
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,460
Mrs. Huang.

391
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,340
I invited Fang to dinner.

392
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,860
Come on, sit down.

393
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,380
Okay.

394
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,180
Have a seat.

395
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,020
Let's eat.

396
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,180
Sit down. Let's eat.

397
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,060
Join us.

398
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,420
Don't be shy.

399
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,940
You're in your third year
of graduate school, right?

400
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
Have you found a job yet?

401
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,980
I've sent out some resumes.

402
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,000
The internet industry has developed
very quickly in recent years.

403
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,420
Last year, several big companies
came for campus recruitment.

404
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,500
They offered job offers before graduation.

405
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,420
I think this year's job prospects

406
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
should be even better.

407
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,420
In our country,

408
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,420
we've lagged behind the West
in high-tech industries.

409
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,860
The next few decades

410
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,700
will depend on you young people.

411
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
There are many opportunities
in various industries now.

412
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,180
Psychology,

413
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,580
in our country, is still an emerging field.

414
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,740
Huang's major will

415
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,580
definitely have great potential in the future.

416
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,220
She's not settled yet.

417
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,260
She might not necessarily work
in this field after graduation.

418
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,100
Enjoy. Don't be shy.

419
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,900
Alright.

420
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,420
I'm not sure

421
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,100
if this food suits your taste.

422
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,340
It's delicious.

423
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,260
Fang has already explained it to me.

424
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,500
You misunderstood him.

425
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,220
That girl is not his girlfriend.

426
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,940
Huang,

427
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,020
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,100
Because of this matter,

429
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,740
I caused you so much trouble.

430
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,780
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,180
Hu Lin is not my girlfriend.

432
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,860
I've made it clear to her.

433
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,820
She won't bother you anymore.

434
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,900
That girl was pursuing Fang,

435
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,780
and she saw you as a rival.

436
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,340
Fang felt wronged.

437
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,580
I consider you a friend.

438
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,100
I didn't lie to you.

439
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,380
Actually, I don't need to explain

440
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,380
whether I have a girlfriend or not.

441
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,180
I wasn't planning to date.

442
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,220
Dating is a luxury

443
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,140
for me.

444
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,700
It's a burden.

445
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
I don't have the time,

446
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,980
nor the financial means.

447
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,740
My dad

448
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,420
passed away when I was very young.

449
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,020
My mom worked two jobs alone

450
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,380
to support me until college.

451
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,540
I worked part-time since freshman year,

452
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,140
and struggled for a long time

453
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,940
when I got
the grad school recommendation.

454
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,260
Once I decided to pursue my master's,

455
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,980
there was no turning back.

456
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,700
I'll give my all

457
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,300
to earn a full scholarship.

458
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,580
I just have a few years

459
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,340
at school.

460
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm not qualified to think about love.

461
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,780
Come on.

462
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Don't focus on talking.

463
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,380
Eat the shrimp.

464
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,260
Thank you, Mrs. Huang,

465
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,140
How can I let you wash dishes?

466
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,580
Come on, I got it. Let me.

467
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,460
- Look at you.
- Mrs. Huang.

468
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,780
You two talk, and I'll wash them.

469
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,940
Well.

470
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,820
Sorry to trouble you, really.

471
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,380
No worries.

472
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,380
I think he can be a good friend

473
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,540
because neither of you
wants to be in a relationship.

474
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,060
I just want something simple

475
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,140
and relaxing.

476
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,260
Then I'm relieved.

477
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,520
One shouldn't go grocery shopping

478
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,740
on an empty stomach.

479
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,260
You'll end up buying the wrong things,

480
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,580
putting things
you don't really want in the cart.

481
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,860
Similarly,

482
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,940
you shouldn't

483
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,300
start a relationship when feeling lonely.

484
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,420
I'm not lonely.

485
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,860
Rose,

486
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,780
don't be too hard on yourself.

487
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,580
People still need friends.

488
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
(Inbox, To Su)

489
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,940
Su,

490
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,420
do you feel lonely?

491
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,060
Is loneliness really that scary?

492
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,180
There's nothing for you here today.

493
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,800
You may leave now.

494
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,180
Give me the key.

495
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,380
Long time no see.

496
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,380
It's been a while.

497
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,180
Fifteen days.

498
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,820
If you count from
when we met at the office,

499
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,540
plus nine hours and seventeen minutes.

500
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,780
Do you know why
I remember it so clearly?

501
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,740
These days I haven't seen you,

502
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,460
I've been thinking about what you said

503
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,860
and about

504
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,060
what I should say to you.

505
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,340
My mind

506
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,620
was all over the place.

507
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,300
Then don't say it.

508
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,980
Su,

509
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,100
can I call you like that too?

510
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,300
Others date

511
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,900
by getting to know each other,

512
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,500
then confessing,

513
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,340
and happily staying together.

514
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,180
They might also argue

515
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,140
and

516
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,180
spend the night in the end.

517
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,260
But we started with arguments

518
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,860
and then happily
became friends for a few days.

519
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,580
After that night,

520
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,860
I found out I didn't know you at all.

521
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,060
This sequence is all messed up.

522
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
So?

523
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,700
After thinking about it for so many days,

524
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,420
I still like you.

525
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,180
Are you pitying me?

526
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,180
No.

527
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,460
You...

528
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,340
Why would you think that?

529
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,900
Didn't I make it clear last time?

530
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,020
I don't need a man.

531
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,340
You can't judge all men

532
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,420
based on one.

533
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,140
Su,

534
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,620
you taught me to exercise,

535
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,860
ran with me, and talked with me.

536
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,780
You don't dislike me, right?

537
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,260
Then

538
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,020
why can't our relationship

539
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,580
move forward?

540
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,420
No need.

541
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,060
Let's have a try.

542
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,940
Let's have a try.

543
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,100
You...

544
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,940
Just treat me like I'm here to apply.

545
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,120
I'm applying to be your boyfriend,

546
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,220
with a trial period of six months.

547
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,300
If it doesn't work, you can fire me.

548
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,180
Is that okay?

549
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,020
Tina.

550
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,620
This is next quarter's
project management plan.

551
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,060
When it comes
to personnel and management,

552
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,780
I've always trusted you very much

553
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,980
because you're calm and rational enough.

554
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,100
But

555
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,540
I haven't assigned

556
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,580
any art planning projects to you.

557
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,300
Do you know why?

558
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,060
Why?

559
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,860
Art planning
requires emotional investment.

560
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,940
It's about reflecting emotions.

561
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,340
But I think

562
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,780
you lack emotional sensitivity.

563
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,380
Let me put it this way.

564
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,860
You're not good at expressing emotions.

565
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,340
If your goal

566
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,900
is to be a professional manager,

567
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,460
with your current abilities,

568
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,580
whether at Cyan

569
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,340
or any other company,

570
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,260
you'll be fine.

571
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,420
But if you want to succeed

572
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
in the art industry,

573
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,260
you must learn
to balance reason and emotion.

574
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,100
Don't be afraid of losing control.

575
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,860
Go ahead and fall in love.

576
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,220
Is it a job requirement?

577
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,020
Of course not.

578
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,780
Just some personal advice from me.

579
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,380
You can take it

580
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,460
or leave it.

581
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,380
I'm not interested in your private life.

582
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,100
But I think

583
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,980
you've been stuck

584
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,180
in a very oppressive state for a long time.

585
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
If this continues,

586
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,460
you'll lose sensitivity to beauty.

587
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,980
The question you asked me last time
made me think for a long time.

588
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,220
(Rose)

589
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,140
Loneliness itself isn't scary.

590
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,020
What's scary is

591
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,260
when a person is lonely for a long time,

592
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,580
grows thick scales,

593
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,100
and loses the ability to get close to others.

594
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,860
Once you long for warmth,

595
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,780
you have to endure the pain

596
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,300
and peel off the scales

597
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,300
one by one with your own hands.

598
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,860
Morning, Senior Fang.

599
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,860
Morning.

600
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,820
Are you going back to school too?

601
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,980
Yes, back to school.

602
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,860
Has Mrs. Huang returned to Beijing?

603
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,620
She's already arrived.

604
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,260
Thank you
for picking the Shanghai specialty.

605
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,220
You're welcome.

606
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,500
By the way,

607
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,900
I just bought this in the morning.

608
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,940
It's still warm. Have it.

609
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,540
What about you?

610
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,700
I'm not hungry, come on.

611
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,380
Here.

612
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,060
You haven't had breakfast, right?

613
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,260
Thank you.

614
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,660
The bus is here. The bus is here.

615
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,860
(If you once longed for something,)

616
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,500
(but you could never get it,)

617
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,420
(you'd hypnotize yourself)

618
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,580
(and tell yourself you don't need it,)

619
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,140
(you don't want it,)

620
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,420
(you look down on it,)

621
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,500
(and even)

622
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,740
(detest it.)

623
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,540
(When that thing really comes to you,)

624
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,620
(the first thing you do would be reject)

625
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,820
(and avoid.)

626
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
(In the depths of your heart,)

627
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,620
(a voice tells you)

628
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,580
(you don't deserve it.)

629
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,940
My treat today.

630
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,460
It's not for celebration.

631
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,500
I guess it won't be good.

632
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,340
Yes,

633
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,340
but I should say it first.

634
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,740
Say it. I'm all ears.

635
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,340
The last time
my words were pretty hurtful.

636
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,380
I apologize to you.

637
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm sorry.
