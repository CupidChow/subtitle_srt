=The Tale of Rose=

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,980
The food is okay, right?

4
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,860
It's pretty good.

5
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,620
You seem quite busy.

6
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Working even on weekends.

7
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
It's all the same to me.

8
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,980
I don't have much else to do.

9
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,580
It's nice being in the lab,

10
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,420
quiet and peaceful.

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,820
Not everyone can handle

12
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,620
being in the lab.

13
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,740
You must be a top student

14
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,100
to pursue a Ph.D.

15
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,460
I'm not.

16
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,500
My grades are pretty average.

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,140
I actually don't know what else I can do

18
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,740
besides studying.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,660
So I've just kept studying till now.

20
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,580
When we were texting before,

21
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,420
I thought you didn't like talking much.

22
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,700
Mainly because I didn't know what to say.

23
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,580
What do you usually
talk about with others?

24
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,980
I hardly talk at all.

25
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,740
Just like now,
you're sitting across from me,

26
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,220
and I

27
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,340
also don't know what to say.

28
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,500
You're quite candid.

29
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,620
Shouldn't I be?

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,100
Yes, you should.

31
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,620
If you really don't know
what to talk about with me,

32
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,420
you can talk about your field of study.

33
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,580
You can help me recall

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,980
the periodic table of elements.

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,820
Okay.

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,260
Hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium, boron,

37
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,620
carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, fluorine, neon,

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,220
sodium, magnesium, aluminum,
silicon, phosphorus,

39
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,640
sulfur, chlorine, argon,
potassium, calcium.

40
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,100
Are you okay?

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,540
I'm fine.

42
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,860
What's this?

43
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,660
A primary school essay?

44
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,260
This is the exhibition plan I wrote
based on last year's activity.

45
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,700
The China-France Culture Fair
hasn't started yet,

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
and writing a project proposal
isn't your job.

47
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,900
Who told you to write it?

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,100
Myself.

49
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,700
I want to take responsibility
for contacting Mr. Teng.

50
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,100
What are you thinking?

51
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,580
What made you think

52
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
I'd give such an important task to you?

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,340
Because I helped you meet him.

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,900
That's not what you want, right?

55
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,940
If you want
to meet the guy from that day,

56
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,140
you could've just asked for his number.

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,660
No need to go through so much trouble.

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,820
That's just one aspect.

59
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,260
I want to understand this industry

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
and the work as soon as possible.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,780
I want to understand
what you're talking about.

62
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,820
I'm a bit tired. I'll rest for a while.

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,540
Take the flowers away.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,220
Today's lucky color is white.

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,460
When's your birthday?

66
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,020
November 13th.

67
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,100
Thank you.

68
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,460
A Scorpio.

69
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,140
I'm a Taurus.

70
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,220
Our zodiac signs seem to match.

71
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,820
Really?

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,020
A Scorpio

73
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,300
is aloof, mysterious, and charismatic.

74
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,740
That sounds like you.

75
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,540
But Scorpios don't like to follow rules.

76
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,620
You've been studying for so many years.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,220
What's your rising sign?

78
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,940
Rising sign?

79
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,980
Your zodiac rising sign.

80
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,060
I don't know.

81
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,900
I'll look it up online for you.

82
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,300
The traits of the rising sign

83
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,220
are ingrained in the subconscious.

84
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,700
For example, if you're a Scorpio

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,140
with Taurus rising,

86
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,540
you'll exhibit traits closer

87
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,580
to the stability

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,860
and practicality of an earth sign.

89
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,020
You're not even thirty yet.

90
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,060
You haven't reached that stage yet.

91
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,060
Just forget what I said.

92
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,300
I've heard before

93
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,860
that scientists conducted a study,

94
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,980
taking one characteristic phrase

95
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,020
from each zodiac sign

96
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,780
and presenting them

97
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,820
to participants.

98
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,940
Almost every participant claimed

99
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,460
the description
matched their personality.

100
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,300
This study suggests

101
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,740
that as long as one phrase

102
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
matches the participant's
self-description,

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,900
they will automatically

104
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,060
ignore all other inaccurate descriptions.

105
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,540
So, astrology research

106
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,180
is more like psychology research.

107
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,780
Well,

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,900
you're making sense.

109
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,220
I thought all girls believed in this.

110
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,820
I don't actually believe it myself.

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,820
When are you free?

112
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,100
I'll come to the lab
to hang out with you.

113
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
The lab is for experiments.

114
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,260
Playing there would affect the data.

115
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,900
I mean I'll come to the lab to find you

116
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,060
and take you out.

117
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,780
Sure.

118
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,140
I'll head back now.

119
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,060
I'll walk you.

120
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,100
No need. It's very close.

121
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,260
I can manage.

122
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,580
Alright then, you go ahead.

123
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,460
Goodbye.

124
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,340
Take care.

125
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,260
Add Huang Yimei to the project team?

126
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,260
She'll still be my assistant

127
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,980
and report directly to me.

128
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,780
Just report to you on the project.

129
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,660
May I ask

130
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,940
why it's arranged like this?

131
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,260
The proposal for
the China-France Culture Fair.

132
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,540
I didn't write this one.

133
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,860
Huang Yimei did.

134
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,380
It's childish, right?

135
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,180
It's like a petition.

136
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,900
She's bold yet meticulous,

137
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,260
capable, and adaptable.

138
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,860
I think she handled it well last night.

139
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,020
Knowing how to use people
is an important skill for a manager.

140
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,660
You have a good eye.

141
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,460
Huang Yimei is quite intelligent

142
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,260
but lacks experience.

143
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,980
If she wants to catch up

144
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,300
with other colleagues' progress,

145
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,820
she'll have to put in extra effort.

146
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,780
It depends

147
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,180
on whether she's willing
to make that effort.

148
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,700
Desire leads to motivation.

149
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,900
Ambitious people like her

150
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,900
should be sent
to the front lines to hunt.

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,180
Okay, I understand.

152
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll arrange it when I get back.

153

(Personal statement:
Let's walk together)

155
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,540
Let's walk together?

156
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,220
With whom?

157
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,220
(Hetang Yuese)

158

(Send message)

159
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,980
(Hello, I'm Huang Zhenhua.)

160
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,380
(We've met before.)

161
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,220
(Feels awkward.)

162
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,260
(You're here. Hahaha.)

163
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,660
(So giddy.)

164
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,820
(You're finally here. I've been waiting.)

165
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,860
(A bit weird.)

166
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,180
(You're here. Haven't seen you online.
Are you busy with school lately?)

167

(Message failed
The recipient is offline)

168
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
You...

169
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,860
I've been busy for nothing.

170
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,340
(Personal statement:
The first step of turning around)

171
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,660
That's me.

172
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,980
- Let's grab a drink sometime.
- Okay.

173
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,300
I know a collector.

174
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,180
We can meet him sometime.

175
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,020
Sure.

176
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,660
When should we go for a meal together?

177
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,980
Sounds good.

178
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
Hello, please have a seat.

179
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,860
Okay.

180
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,100
Sure.

181
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,060
Michael Jackson
is having a concert in September.

182
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,020
- Really?
- Let's go together.

183
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,740
Great, great.

184
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,340
There's a way.

185
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,340
It's almost time. Please sit.

186
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,100
Okay.

187
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,260
Let's start.

188
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,380
I see we have a new colleague today.

189
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,780
I'm Eric, Zhuang Guodong,

190
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,220
representative of
Goran's Creative Department,

191
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,140
also the team leader

192
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,260
of the Future Master project.

193
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,220
How should I address you?

194
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm Huang Yimei from Cyan.
Hello, everyone.

195
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,100
Welcome.

196
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,020
Let's summarize the feedback

197
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,780
since the last meeting.

198
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,300
The Future Master is mainly

199
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,260
about collaborating with young artists,

200
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
so I think we should fully

201
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,100
present their works

202
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,380
and experiences

203
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,140
to those who come to exhibit or visit.

204
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,140
(Theme Analysis)

205
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,300
Alright, let's communicate
this meeting's plan

206
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,860
with other departments.

207
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,660
We'll reconvene next time. See you.

208
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
Eric.

209
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,820
Let's go.

210
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,660
I started paying attention

211
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,300
to this artist

212
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,740
since the Venice Biennale in 1999.

213
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,380
When he won the Golden Lion Award, right?

214
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,220
I went to see it.

215
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,860
You were in Venice that year too?

216
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,980
I was in France those years.

217
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,300
I was invited by a friend.

218
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,420
No wonder you're so knowledgeable

219
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
about modern French art.

220
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,540
When I went to Paris before,

221
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,740
I spent a whole day
at the Pompidou Center,

222
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,300
deeply fascinated

223
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,700
by their modern art.

224
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
What do you like?

225
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,220
Boldness, rebellion,

226
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,160
and subversion of tradition.

227
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,900
Not everyone appreciates that charm.

228
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,380
Looks like you have unique tastes.

229
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
I know a bit.

230
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,380
If there's anything I don't understand,

231
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,860
I'll consult you.

232
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,980
You're flattering me. We'll talk more.

233
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,820
Sure.

234
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,140
She doesn't like you, right?

235
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,740
She seems to like me,

236
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,100
but not that much.

237
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,140
Why the sigh?

238
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Used to being surrounded by suitors,

239
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,900
and now I suddenly realize

240
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,420
that I'm just one of them.

241
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,100
That doesn't sound like me.

242
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,060
Do you mean you?

243
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,460
Are you in love?

244
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,060
Who?

245
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,260
I don't even know if he likes me yet.

246
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,740
There is a special someone?

247
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,700
Well,

248
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,060
let him like you.

249
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
For you, this should be simple.

250
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,140
Put on your hot pants, roller skates,

251
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,100
and you'll captivate him.

252
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,340
He's a bit different.

253
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,420
He's different?

254
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,220
You're troubled by love.

255
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,780
He's different?

256
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,660
Shihui, you can rest easy now.

257
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,940
Someone avenged you.

258
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,100
Why get physical?

259
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,020
Let me tell you.

260
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,420
Two types of people who don't know
how to ask people out.

261
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,420
One is those who are unattractive
and have no chance.

262
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,660
The other type

263
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,780
is people like you.

264
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,300
Because with a face like yours,

265
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,460
you're already armed to the teeth.

266
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,980
You don't need to do anything,

267
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,620
so you don't know
how to make things happen.

268
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,540
What if he is also pretty?

269
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,580
Then you'll have to use some tactics.

270
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,820
Tactics?

271
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,900
Visual attraction is the simplest way
to attract men.

272
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,100
Hello.

273
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
Everyone's here now.

274
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
Let's begin.

275
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,700
Now everyone,
see the document in your hands.

276
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,220
It's the backup artists
prepared by Lisa.

277
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,420
Because we're concerned

278
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,660
that some young artists may,

279
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,620
due to personal reasons,

280
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,380
can't submit their work on time,

281
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,100
so we've prepared this Plan B.

282
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,380
Have you all read the summary
of the last meeting?

283
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,860
Yes, we have.

284
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,700
Any questions?

285
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,940
- None.
- If there are none,

286
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,380
let's continue.

287
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,220
I have a question.

288
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,820
But men attracted by simple methods

289
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,260
usually have simpler minds.

290
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,620
To attract high-quality men,

291
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,500
you need a bit more

292
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,780
mental challenge and collision.

293
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,100
Two points were missed in the summary,

294
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,540
which I've added.

295
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,860
I'll email it to everyone later.

296
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,100
Okay.

297
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,580
(Candidate Gallery A)
We have three candidate galleries this time.

298
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm inclined toward the Yiyi Gallery.

299
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,340
I object.

300
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,420
Does anyone have any opinions

301
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,260
on this artist's works?

302
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,740
I do.

303
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,380
Because this time, there are more works

304
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,460
from Chinese artists,

305
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,060
so I suggest

306
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,940
our exhibition hall
should have a Chinese-style design.

307
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,980
I don't think that's appropriate.

308
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,180
I object. I have an opinion.

309
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,260
That's it for today's meeting.

310
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,940
Any other questions?

311
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,580
I don't have any questions.

312
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,220
Meeting adjourned.

313
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,700
Let's go shopping this weekend.

314
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,540
Sure.

315
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,820
Do you have problems with me?

316
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,580
No.

317
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,500
Why were you contradicting me
in the meeting?

318
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,020
Meetings are for discussions.

319
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,780
Discussions lead to different opinions.

320
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,780
But we don't have to debate

321
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,380
like it's a battle of wits.

322
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,340
How about we exchange phone numbers?

323
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,180
If you have any questions,

324
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,260
feel free to discuss them with me.

325
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,980
Okay?

326
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
Done.

327
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,900
The best hunters

328
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,500
always appear as prey.

329
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,700
Let's have some afternoon tea.

330
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,860
Take one.

331
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,180
We have dessert now.

332
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,420
- Have a try.
- Thank you.

333
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,620
- Have a try.
- I'll have one.

334
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Han Ying's treat.

335
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,580
It's delicious.

336
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,460
Where did you get it?

337
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,820
Eric gave it to me
when we had dinner last night.

338
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,140
- Just you two?
- Yes.

339
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,460
Good for you.

340
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,500
You've got him so soon.

341
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,220
Come on.

342
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,820
It's just a dinner.

343
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,780
Come on.

344
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,300
Just a dinner.

345
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,700
But

346
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,460
he invited me to attend

347
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,860
the Venice Biennale together this year.

348
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,820
- She's treating everyone to...
- You're welcome.

349
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,660
Thanks.

350
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,460
Pick one.

351
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,420
No, I'm on a diet.

352
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,180
Just taste it.

353
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,420
Have some dessert.

354
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,220
I really envy her.

355
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,180
When will I ever get to eat?

356
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,980
I'll bring it up.

357
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,260
This big pot.

358
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,580
Right, sprinkle it on later.

359
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,180
Don't you already have his phone number?

360
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,580
Just call and ask him out.

361
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,740
Enough, enough.

362
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,020
I don't have an excuse.

363
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,780
Why do you need an excuse?

364
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,900
Did you forget how you helped me
ask Bai Xiaohe out?

365
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,700
You're a guy, but I'm a girl.

366
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,940
Girls don't usually ask guys out.

367
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,900
Why do girls

368
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,220
have so many convoluted thoughts?

369
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,380
You can see through men when they talk.

370
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
Be straightforward.

371
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,420
It's like input and output.

372
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,500
It's that simple.

373
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,540
Alright, dinner's ready.

374
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
- Let's eat. Come on.
- Okay.

375
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,780
Alright.

376
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,420
The dishes are ready.

377
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,380
Come, sit. Come.

378
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,420
- Move over.
- Here, move, move.

379
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,580
Put the fish in the middle.

380
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,780
How's that?

381
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,540
It's too lavish.

382
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,700
It's perfect in every way.

383
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,380
If Rosie isn't here,
you'll never cook so much.

384
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,100
I'm just basking in your glory.

385
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,220
How was it meeting that girl?

386
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,780
Can't find any faults with her.

387
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,100
She's beautiful, well-educated,

388
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,130
not pretentious,
independent, and not clingy.

389
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,380
That fits your criteria.

390
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,140
It does fit,

391
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,420
but it feels strange.

392
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,860
How can having no faults become a fault?

393
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,380
You can't be so picky.

394
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,660
I'm not being picky.

395
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,900
It's just that I don't feel

396
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,380
that she has...

397
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,260
Chemical reaction.

398
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,100
Right.

399
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,460
The chemical reaction
between active and inert substances

400
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,060
(Zhuang Guodong: Are you and Han Ying)
is different.

401
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,740
She's slow to warm up.

402
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,820
(Zhuang Guodong: Are you dating Han Ying?)
Take your time to get to know her.

403
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,860
If it doesn't work out,

404
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,700
here,

405
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,980
add some catalyst.

406
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
What catalyst?

407
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,900
Bring your sister along for some fun.

408
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,740
Come on.

409
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,180
It's none of my business.

410
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,260
With you being so lively around,

411
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,700
they'll get close quickly.

412
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,820
Get close quickly.

413
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,940
Mom, do you know

414
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,060
- what I admire most about you?
- What?

415
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,620
No matter how emotional the issue is,

416
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,140
you always use rational thinking

417
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,980
and scientific methods,

418
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,660
and come up with a formulaic solution.

420
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,580
So, I was right.

421
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,220
Of course.

422
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,180
Then,

423

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,700
Before the 2004 expansion,

435
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,660
the EU had eleven working languages.

436
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,660
The translation
of a large number of documents

437
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,740
was an important part
of the EU expansion.

438
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,580
Currently, the EU has 90,000 pages

439
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,460
of effective legal provisions
being implemented.

440
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,820
These provisions must be translated

441
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,020

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,540
It's a deal.

563
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,020
Cheers.

564
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,740
Your company seems
to value the culture event,

565
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,540
sending a newcomer over.

566
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,260
You mean Huang Yimei?

567
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,600
She's the assistant
to the general manager.

568
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,460
What's the matter?

569
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,260
I just feel your company

570
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,180
doesn't trust us very much,

571
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,780
or they don't trust you very much,

572
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,020
sending someone over to supervise.

573
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,180
She seems to have
just graduated this year

574
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,100
from some art school.

575
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,620
She doesn't have much work experience.

576
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,980
I think the boss sent her here
just to learn.

577
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,380
Hello, the bill, please.

578
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,580
Sure, please wait a moment.

579
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,540
Thank you.

580
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,580
Next time, it's on me.

581
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
You're welcome.

582
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,260
Hello.

583
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,260
Is there anything else you need, sir?

584
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,100
Please pack these two boxes
of macarons for takeaway.

585
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,220
Alright, please wait a moment.

586
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,900
Take them back
and let your colleagues try them.

587
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,700
Sure.

What do you want? Diced Chicken.

597
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,020
Alright.

598
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,940
Twice-cooked Pork.

Sir-fired Meat
with Cucumber and Black Fungus.

600
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,580
And three chicken legs.

601
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,420
That's enough.

602
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,900
Your sister isn't coming back today.

603
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,740
It's just the three of us.

604
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
That'll do.

605
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,700
No need for chicken legs,
just some greens.

606
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,540
Greens, sure.

607
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,300
I get it now.

608
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,460
Our family's meal

609
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,860
is a matter of quality
when Rosie is around.

610
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,420
When she's not,
it's a matter of quantity.

611
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,460
Even a top chef at a state banquet

612
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,700
can't steam bear paws
and deer tails every day.

613
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,580
The canteen is great,

614
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,660
affordable,

615
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,340
and diverse.

616
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,380
If you feed me those every day,
I guarantee...

617
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,220
What's wrong?

618
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,060
Dad, I'll go say hi to a friend.

619
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,460
You should head home first.

620
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,060
It's that girl, right?

621
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,340
I'll explain at home.

622
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,820
- Okay, okay.
- Go on.

623
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,540
Xiaohe.

624
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,460
What a coincidence that you're here.

625
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Is anyone sitting here?

626
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,740
No one. Take a seat.

627
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,940
I'm not here to eat.

628
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
My sister's not home,

629
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,180
so my mom isn't cooking.

630
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,340
I'll grab something and go.

631
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
You eat so simply.

632
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,380
Being so thin, you should eat more meat.

633
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,020
I'm used to it.

634
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,220
The fruit in the canteen is fresh.

635
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,060
You should have more.

636
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,260
Okay.

637
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,500
You eat. Don't mind me.

638
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,220
Go ahead.

639
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,660
Okay.

640
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,300
Cyan is a joint venture.

641
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
Although not large in scale,

642
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,500
we're a pioneer in the industry

643
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,540
at home.

644
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,460
So cool.

645
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,820
Who's that?

646
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,580
I'll take you over there to see.

647
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,880
Let's go and have the meeting.

648
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,740
Let's go to that restaurant
we went to last time.

649
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,500
Great.

650
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,260
Is everything ready?

651
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,340
All set.

652
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,660
Sit here.

653
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,300
Hi.

654
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,460
Nice to see you again.

655
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,580
Hello.

656
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,300
Is everyone here?

657
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,460
Let's begin then.

658
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,300
Okay.

659
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,940
After the last meeting,

660
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,900
I summarized

661
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,860
everyone's opinions
into four main points.

662
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,140
First, besides visuals,

663
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,420
can we consider
combining with other senses,

664
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,140
like hearing and smelling?

665
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,700
We could play some representative

666
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,820
French or Chinese music

667
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,420
in the exhibition hall

668
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,220
or use French perfume

669
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,780
or Chinese incense

670
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,060
to showcase our exhibition hall
in multiple dimensions.

671
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,260
Secondly...

672
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,740
Uh...

673
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,020
Since we last met,

674
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,620
we haven't been in touch.

675
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,780
Well...

676
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,620
I...

677
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,980
We're just ordinary friends now.

678
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,460
It might be inappropriate
for me to say this,

679
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,420
but I still

680
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,940
want to know

681
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,740
what you

682
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,940
think of me.

683
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,220
How do you...

684
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,580
I think you're great.

685
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,740
Well,

686
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,260
what about me?

687
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,740
Great.

688
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,060
Excellent.

689
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,660
Since we met with
the purpose of matchmaking,

690
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,020
if we both feel good about each other,

691
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,340
we can continue.

692
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,980
Really?

693
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,300
Well,

694
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,620
that's great.

695
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,100
Then eat up now.

696
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,180
Eat then.

697
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,540
You have an experiment later.

698
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,180
Sure.

699
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,540
Eat some fruit.

700
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,500
No, it's fine.

701
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,340
You eat.

702
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,820
Okay.

703
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,700
Does anyone else have any idea?

704
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,820
Please speak up.

705
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,540
Huang Yimei?

706
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,020
I have no idea.

707
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,740
Then let's end today's meeting.

708
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
It's already 7 o'clock.

709
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,100
Really?

710
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,940
Yeah.

711
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,780
Do you want to grab something
to eat together?

712
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,900
- Sure.
- Sure.

713
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,580
Let's go for a barbecue.

714
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,240
- Right.
- Okay.

715
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,320
We've been cooperating for so long
and never had a meal together.

716
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,140
Does everyone have time?

717
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,380
I do.

718
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,740
I won't go.

719
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,660
Why?

720
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,060
This is the first group activity.

721
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,540
I suggest everyone participate.

722
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,340
Let's go.

723
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,500
Let's go.

724
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,060
We'll have a barbecue later,

725
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,140
and it'll be smoky everywhere,

726
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,100
yet you're fixing your makeup?

727
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,620
Ladies dress themselves
for someone they like.

728
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,180
Han's doing it

729
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,700
for her special someone.

730
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,660
Do you want to try my lipstick?

731
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,220
- No, thanks.
- Ready?

732
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,260
Let's go.

733
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,140
Let's go.

734
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,020
I'm going then.

735
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,420
Hurry up.

736
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,300
- See you later.
- See you.

737
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,020
This is delicious.

738
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,620
This is good. That's overdone.

739
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,460
I love it.

740
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,700
Get me a skewer. Get me a skewer.

741
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,740
More tissue, please.

742
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,060
Let's all drink together. Here.

743
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,060
Come on. Well done.

744
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
Thanks, Mr. Zhuang.

745
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,540
- Thanks, Mr. Zhuang.
- Come on.

746
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,940
- Cheers. Well done.
- Cheers.

747
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,780
- Have more.
- Bottoms up.

748
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,460
Do what you can.

749
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,380
Seriously?

750
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,380
I can't.

751
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,980
- Don't drink too much.
- Don't drink too much.

752
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,900
Stop drinking.

753
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,740
You can have this instead.

754
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,060
Let me pour you a drink.

755
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,220
Sorry, I don't drink.

756
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,620
Not a drop?

757
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,460
No.

758
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,740
You don't drink? How about a beverage?

759
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,460
Waiter.

760
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,660
Hello.

761
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,580
What would you like?

762
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,580
Ginger soda.

763
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,740
Thank you.

764
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,460
Ginger soda, not chilled.

765
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,540
- Thank you.
- Sure.

766
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,060
Try this.

767
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
Trust my drinking capacity.

768
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,140
Stop drinking. Stop.

769
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,940
Are you telling me to drink or not?

770
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,100
- Try this.
- Okay.

771
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,260
Haven't had a drink in a month.

772
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,380
- Here.
- Thanks.

773
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,220
You're welcome.

774
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,540
- Cheers.
- Finish this bottle.

775
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,580
Let's drink.

776
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,460
Let's drink together later.

777
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,300
Cheers.

778
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,260
You just graduated this year?

779
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,980
What did you major in?

780
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,180
Art history.

781
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,780
Let's set up a date next time

782
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,620
at a classy Southern French restaurant.

783
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,100
Sure.

784
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,660
Take a seat.

785
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,980
It's a deal then.

786
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,540
I suddenly remembered
I need to make a call.

787
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,420
You guys continue.

788
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,700
Stop drinking.

789
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,460
You need to learn to drink a bit.

790
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,940
Alcohol...

791
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,020
Bottoms up.

792
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,020
Always busy.

793
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,860
Let's drink without him.

794
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,900
