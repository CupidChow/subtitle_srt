=Episode 8=

3
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,820
I have something to announce.

4
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,540
I have a boyfriend now.

5
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,180
What kind of boyfriend?

6
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,980
The same as the one
from your generation.

7
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,710
Hey, this time,

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,870
Rosie has changed.

9
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,790
She's serious.

10
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,430
You guys don't have to worry anymore

11
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,310
about those messy people bothering her.

12
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
What does he do? How old is he?

13
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,310
How did you two meet?

14
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,900
We met at work.

15
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,340
He's the team leader of our project group.

16
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,390
I've met him.

17
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,740
He looks decent.

18
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,550
Just slightly inferior to me.

19
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,180
He's much more
good-looking than you, okay?

20
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,270
Do you have a photo?

21
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,460
Yes.

22
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,230
Show it to us.

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,710
Come on. Hurry up.

24
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,460
- Do you believe me?
- Let me see.

25
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,500
Here, here, here.

26
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,270
Holding so tight.

27
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,220
Where was it taken?

28
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,590
Not bad, a talented person indeed.

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,740
Right?

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,940
What talented person?

31
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,430
Just a pretty boy.

32
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,780
His cheekbones are a bit high.

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Is he short-tempered?

34
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,460
He's got a great temper.

35
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,460
He's also wearing glasses.

36
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,900
Alright, you can't say anything nice.

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,340
When are you bringing him over?

38
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,550
Bring him over?

39
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,150
Yes.

40
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,740
I'll ask him then.

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,740
Go ahead.

42
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,670
Okay.

43
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,590
You already knew, didn't you?

44
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,270
She didn't tell me.

45
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,780
I happened to run into them one day.

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,620
That's all.

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,620
Why didn't you tell us earlier then?

48
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,110
I...

49
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,550
Mom,

50
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,270
you're quite open-minded.

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,310
I must support proper relationships.

52
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,580
Sure.

53
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,220
You have an email.

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,140
(New email has arrived.
Would you like to read it now?)

55
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,930
(We have chosen you to be the Deputy Director
of the Marketing Department in Paris.)

56
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,860
(Video connecting)

57
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,900
Hey, beauty. How are you?

58
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,550
Was the return journey smooth?

59
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,420
If you're asking about
last month's return from Beijing,

60
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,400
it was smooth.

61
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,270
But if you're asking about
the just return from Belgium,

62
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,820
it was terrible.

63
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,150
I happened to hit
the railway worker strike.

64
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,390
You left Beijing last month?

65
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,470
It's been so long.

66
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,870
Tell me.

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,430
What's up?

68
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,100
I received the offer from the company.

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,500
Really?

70
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,700
That's great!

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,910
What position?

72
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,620
I internally recommended myself
six months ago

73
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,340
for the Deputy Director
of the Marketing Department.

74
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,910
I hadn't heard anything until now.

75
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,490
I thought maybe
I wasn't qualified enough,

76
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,640
or I couldn't compete
with my European colleagues.

77
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,550
But unexpectedly,

78
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,190
I received the offer today.

79
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,420
That's not surprising.

80
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,460
This is French people's work efficiency.

81
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,230
Alright, I won't talk to you anymore.

82
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,400
I just called to share with you.

83
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,300
I'll get back to work.

84
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,620
Bye-bye.

85
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,420
Congratulations, son.

86
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,260
Bye-bye.

87
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,380
(From Huang Yimei: I need to tell you
something important next time.)

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,230
What's wrong?

89
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,900
Are you just letting her off so easily?

90
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,300
Your daughter is in love,

91
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,780
not committing a crime.

92
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,950
It's not a crime,

93
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,750
but remember what happened
with that Zhou guy?

94
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,950
That wasn't her fault.

95
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,780
She's sharp as a tack now.

96
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,030
She won't make the same mistake twice.

97
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,340
Have a little faith in our genes, okay?

98
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,110
She's grown up.

99
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,590
Not fun anymore.

100
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,300
It was better when she was a kid.

101
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,590
She was like a small animal,

102
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,420
happy as long as she was fed,

103
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,420
with fewer worries.

104
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,540
Worry about her tomorrow.

105
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,700
Let's sleep.

106
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,300
You haven't met him.

107
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,030
Stop plotting how to lecture him.

108
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,300
How do you know what I'm thinking?

109
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,900
We grew up
from small animals to feeders.

110
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,150
When we started dating,

111
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,300
my dad named

112
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,980
every dissected little animal in the lab

113
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,750
after you.

114
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,350
You're holding too tight. I can't breathe.

115
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,380
No.

116
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,660
It's been 48 hours since I last held you.

117
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,380
Miss me?

118
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,870
How's your Shanghai exhibition

119
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,140
going recently?

120
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,420
Business secret.

121
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,900
True.

122
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,230
Even though our companies
are partners now,

123
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,300
we might become competitors someday.

124
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,700
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

125
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,180
If that day comes,

126
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,510
would you quit your job for me?

127
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,150
Why can't it be

128
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,580
you quitting your job for me?

129
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,620
Then will you support me?

130
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,470
As long as you're not picky,

131
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,900
I'll just raise you
like a big golden retriever.

132
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
- You...
- I want to go to Paris.

133
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,510
Sure.

134
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,510
I've always wanted to go

135
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,150
where you studied.

136
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,150
If we go to Paris,

137
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,470
is a week enough?

138
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,630
I've just got promoted.

139
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,230
I don't know
if the boss will approve my leave.

140
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,700
Right, I haven't got a passport yet.

141
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,060
I need to get it soon.

142
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,100
I'll go get you a glass of water.

143
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,470
You mentioned texting me earlier.

144
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,870
What's up?

145
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,510
How about coming home with me?

146
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,750
My parents really want to meet you.

147
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,270
It's a weekend.

148
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,900
Our son's off on a trip,

149
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,900
and our daughter's busy dating,

150
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,060
leaving just us two. So quiet.

151
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,940
This will be the norm. Get used to it.

152
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,780
Come, let's eat.

153
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,950
Coming.

154
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,350
Why such a hurry to meet the parents?

155
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,350
You've already met my brother.

156
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
I just don't understand

157
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,990
why you girls are so obsessed

158
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,150
with meeting parents.

159
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,060
Have you brought any other girls home?

160
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,580
I haven't brought any girls home.

161
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,630
I just think a relationship
between two people

162
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,750
shouldn't involve parents.

163
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,630
But family ties

164
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,580
are the strongest in the world.

165
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,540
They're the most important to me.

166
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,060
You know about my parents' relationship.

167
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,990
So, I don't really want

168
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,230
them interfering in my love life.

169
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,750
I didn't say I won't go.

170
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,350
Even if I do,

171
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,230
I need to prepare, right?

172
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm going on a business trip
to Guangzhou in a few days.

173
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,390
I'll buy the gifts.

174
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,780
We'll talk about it when I'm back.

175
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,270
We'll talk about it when I'm back

176
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,270
from Guangzhou with gifts.

177
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,660
Is that okay? I didn't say I won't go.

178
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,230
Are you abandoning
your golden retriever?

179
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,780
Is that okay?

180
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,380
(New email has arrived.
Would you like to read it now?)

181
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,420
(Are you busy?)

182
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,140
(From Zhuang Guodong: Just landed,
meeting clients. Get back to you later.)

for an international passport?)

for visa application?)

(From Zhuang Guodong:
Just finished my busy schedule.)

187
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,660
(Get on QQ. Something to tell you.)

188
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,140
(Video connecting, Video loading)

189
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,940
Hello.

190
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,420
Newly bought flowers.

191
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,030
Beautiful, right?

192
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,420
Not as beautiful as you.

193
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,820
Sorry,

194
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,780
I found out about the surprise
you had for me early.

195
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,260
What surprise?

196
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,270
Paris.

197
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,150
Are you secretly planning

198
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,350
a trip?

199
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,060
You should have told me earlier.

200
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,150
Getting a passport takes a month.

201
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,780
I haven't even asked Tina for leave,

202
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,660
and I don't know

203
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,940
if she'll approve a long leave for me.

204
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,540
Did you check my email?

205
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,140
No, no, no.

206
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,420
I didn't.

207
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,030
I accidentally hit the mouse
while wiping the table

208
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,350
and saw the notification

209
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,150
of the title of your new email.

210
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,580
That's not from a travel agency.

211
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,780
It's from Galant's HR department

212
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,270
to confirm my acceptance of the offer.

213
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,940
What offer?

214
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,380
Open it and see. It's in English.

215
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,780
(We are delighted that
you have decided to join our team.)

216
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,140
(You will be an integral part
of Galant S.A.'s Paris headquarters.)

217
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,620
(To facilitate a smooth onboarding process,
please bring the following documents.)

218
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
(Should you have any questions,
please feel free to contact us.)

219
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,080
(We are dedicated to providing you
with support and assistance.)

220
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,530
(We look forward to creating success
together at our Paris headquarters.)

221
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,020
(Human Resources Department)

222
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,020
(Galant S.A.)

223
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,030
You already accepted it?

224
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,700
Yes.

225
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,470
Why didn't you tell me?

226
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,230
I wanted to tell you.

227
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,670
Sit down

228
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,380
and let me see your face!

229
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,060
Didn't you say we should be
completely honest with each other?

230
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,340
Didn't you say there were
no secrets between us?

231
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,550
Yes.

232
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,910
I intended to tell you,

233
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,380
but you wanted me

234
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,950
to meet your parents at that time.

235
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,370
My mind was a bit scattered.

236
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,510
Have you sorted things out now?

237
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,860
Galant's branch in Beijing
is small in scale,

238
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,110
with stable staff

239
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,230
and limited upward mobility.

240
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,140
I accepted this position initially

241
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,100
because there were no vacancies
at the Paris headquarters.

242
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,510
However, the headquarters
announces vacancies

243
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,510
on the intranet every year,

244
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,470
encouraging self-recommendation
from employees.

245
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,230
I studied management,

246
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,060
and if I could go
to the Paris headquarters,

247
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,670
I would have better career prospects.

248
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm asking if you've thought it through.

249
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,710
This application was sent six months ago,

250
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,710
when I didn't even know you.

251
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,300
But you know me now.

252
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,030
When you accepted the offer,

253
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,620
you didn't want to discuss it with me?

254
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,430
This is my job.

255
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,190
Can't I make decisions myself?

256
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,300
When did you meet me?

257
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,990
Why didn't you make a decision then?

258
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,100
Now you're talking about this?

259
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,710
Who do you think you are?

260
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,620
What am I to you,
now that you're going to Paris?

261
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,510
What do we do now? You tell me!

262
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,430
We can still see each other.

263
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,620
We can video call like this.

264
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,780
I'll be back when I'm free,

265
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,620
or you can come and find me.

266
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,370
Isn't that
how long-distance relationships work?

267
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,670
It's not long-distance.

268
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,510
It's international.

269
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,060
What's the difference?

270
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,030
A distance of ten thousand kilometers,

271
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,230
with a six-hour time difference.

272
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,910
Oh, my.

273
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,470
There will always be a solution.

274
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,870
Say something.

275
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,070
Are you angry?

276
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,030
Isn't it good news
that I have a better job opportunity?

277
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,670
Are you going to break up with me
because of this?

278
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,060
Are you really going?

279
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,140
I've been waiting for this opportunity
for a long time.

280
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,190
Would you still have applied

281
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,300
after you met me?

282
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,230
This hypothetical scenario is meaningless.

283
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,820
Why is it meaningless?

284
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,950
I want to ask you.

285
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,940
Maybe not.

286
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,300
So, it's possible, right?

287
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,580
I can't bear to leave you,

288
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,380
but I'm a man.

289
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,060
I should consider
my job and future, right?

290
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,230
Women also have careers.

291
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,820
Why can't women have careers?

292
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,580
I'm not asking for your answer.

293
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,380
I want to know your attitude.

294
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,620
What's wrong with my attitude?

295
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,910
You wanted me to be honest
and not lie to you.

296
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,780
I told you the truth,

297
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,620
and you couldn't accept it.

298
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,340
Can you stop being so contradictory?

299
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,340
If it were after I met you,

300
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,670
I might have still applied,

301
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,620
or I might not have.

302
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
And even if I go,

303
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,620
I'll find a way to solve our problems.

304
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,100
Can you stop twisting my words?

305
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
Do you have a solution then?

306
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,710
Are you making empty promises?

307
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,340
I've been meeting clients all afternoon,

308
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,670
and I've been busy
since I got off the plane.

309
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,580
Can you stop being unreasonable?

310
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,260
Am I being unreasonable?

311
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,820
I have a meeting with colleagues later.

312
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,890
Let's talk when I'm back in Beijing.

313
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,780
No,

314
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,230
you must clarify this today.

315
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,060
Huang Yimei, you're going too far.

316
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,030
Hello?

317
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,270
Hello, hello.

318
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,070
Okay, okay.

319
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,060

Are you the owner?

355
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,710
The house is under my name,

356
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,860
but it was bought by my ex-wife.

357
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,670
Do you know the girl inside?

358
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,660
I don't know her.

359

360

but I can't contact him now.

361
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,030
She has a key to your house

362
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,100
and there are her photos in the room.

363
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,780
She should be my son's girlfriend.

364
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,110
Girlfriend?

365
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,100
She trashed your house like this.

366
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,220
Are you going to pursue it?

367
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,190
How could I pursue it?

368
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,750
She might become my daughter-in-law.

369
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,270
It's normal for young couples to quarrel.

370
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,270
Here's the thing.

371
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,910
A neighbor said there was a lot
of noise in your house

372
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,480
and thought it was a burglary,

373
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,350
so they called the police.

374
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,780
It's a misunderstanding.

375
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,620
I'll explain to the neighbors later.

376
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,250
- Hello, officer.
- Okay.

377
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,470
- I'm a friend of Huang Yimei's.
- Hello.

378
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,340
- Hello.
- Where is she?

379
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,460
She's inside.

380
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,860
- Can I go in?
- Sure, go ahead.

381
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,430
- Thank you. Thank you.
- No problem.

382
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,470
Just remember it.

383
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,460
Of course.

384
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,470
I'm going

385
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,540
to visit

386
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,660
the neighbors later,

387
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,910
explain to them,

388
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,750
and apologize.

389
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,990
- Sure.
- You disturbed them.

390
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,830
Okay.

391
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,850
Thank you for your cooperation.

392
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,620
Huang Yimei, what's wrong?

393
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,790
Are you okay?

394
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,190
There, there.

395
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,110
It's fine now.

396
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm here.

397
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,470
Can I get you a glass of water?

398
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,220
Take a seat.

399
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,830
Drink slowly.

400
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,620
This...

401
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,460
The owner said

402
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,830
not to pursue it.

403
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,860
You can leave now.

404
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,380
Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,470
Talk it out if there are any conflicts.

406
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,470
Sure.

407
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,620
You shouldn't vent your emotions
by smashing things.

408
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,780
It disturbs others, right?

409
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,620
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,190
- Well, thank you.
- Okay, sure.

411
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,530
- Thank you for your trouble.
- No problem.

412
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,710
Thank you, officers.

413
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,580
It's nothing.

414
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,300
- Alright.
- Alright, take care.

415
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,750
- You hurry and clean up.
- Okay, okay.

416
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,590
How are you feeling?

417
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,060
Do you want another drink?

418
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,620
Hello, you are...

419
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,270
I'm Zhuang Guodong's father.

420
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

421
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,540
You're Huang Yimei,

422
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,470
Guodong's girlfriend, right?

423
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,270
Not anymore.

424
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,820
Can I talk to you for a moment?

425
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,440
Can you do it alone?

426
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,890
I'll wait for you at the door.

427
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,850
If you need anything, call me.

428
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,020
Be careful.

429
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,910
Okay, sure.

430
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,540
How much did I break?

431
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
You calculate it.

432
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,870
I'll pay for it.

433
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,750
No need, no need.

434
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,220
No need to pay.

435
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,190
Since he's done something to harm you,

436
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,670
it's his fault.

437
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,270
Do you know what he did?

438
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,420
I don't know.

439
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,860
His phone is turned off.

440
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,060
Then he must have done something bad.

441
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,900
Why?

442
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,710
Isn't it obvious?

443
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,190
He's gone into hiding out of guilt.

444
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,420
Miss,

445
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,670
you're at his place.

446
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,710
You can vent however you want.

447
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,060
I won't stop you,

448
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,620
nor will I blame you.

449
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,300
I won't call the police either,

450
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,270
but let's not

451
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,270
do anything to harm yourself.

452
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,310
Don't turn on the gas stove.

453
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,350
Don't start a fire.

454
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,060
Right?

455
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,190
That's right.

456
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,230
You...

457
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,510
I'll find him.

458
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,870
I'll bring him here to apologize to you,

459
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,410
so you can teach him a lesson.

460
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,100
I'll go call your friend.

461
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,350
You take care of yourself.

462
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,310
Aren't you going to ask me
what happened?

463
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,100
The police already told me.

464
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,180
Then why don't you ask
why I smashed his house?

465
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,260
It wasn't my house you smashed.

466
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,700
Did you already know
this day would come?

467
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,670
Yes.

468
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,220
Just didn't expect it to be so soon.

469
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,060
You're strange, you know?

470
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,740
You're so nice,

471
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,470
but you're always being so sarcastic.

472
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,420
Can you walk?

473
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,310
Can you smell of alcohol?

474
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,910
Don't talk when you go in.

475
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,580
You're back so late,

476
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,660
and you didn't answer your phone.

477
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,030
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Huang.

478
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,830
You are...

479
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,910
I'm Huang Yimei's supervisor.

480
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,750
My surname is Su.

481
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,350
She worked with me so late at night,

482
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,950
so I gave her a ride home.

483
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,540
Thank you, thank you.

484
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,580
Come in and sit for a while.

485
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,510
- No, no, no need.
- Sit for a while.

486
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,060
I'll leave first. You guys rest early.

487
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,990
Thank you, thank you.

488
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,870
No need, no need. Goodbye.

489
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,060
- Okay.
- Rest early.

490
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,870
