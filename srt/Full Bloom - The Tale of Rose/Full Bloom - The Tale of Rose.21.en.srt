=Episode 21=

3
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,710
I can do it myself.

4
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,740
Mom.

5
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,030
Why don't you speak Mandarin?

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,540
She can't understand our dialect.

7
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,820
I don't have much to say to her.

8
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,150
She's educated.

9
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,230
She's your daughter-in-law.

10
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,510
You two will need to talk eventually.

11
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,340
I'll talk if I have to.

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,430
You chose your wife

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,510
without asking if I approved.

14
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,940
Such a pretty daughter-in-law

15
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,030
and you're not satisfied?

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,310
What's the use of being pretty?

17
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,060
You'll have to pamper her every day.

18
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,500
Look at her hands.

19
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,660
She's not someone who does housework.

20
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,940
Why do you want her to do housework?

21
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,150
You're not hiring a maid.

22
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,830
I'm just worried about you.

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,310
You work

24
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,500
and do house chores.

25
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,900
Men don't do housework.

26
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,870
It's too hard.

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,460
Housework

28
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,060
is for both of us to do together.

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,340
We also earn and spend money together.

30
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,150
It's good this way.

31
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,990
Her family is in Beijing.

32
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,460
Won't you have to accompany her home

33
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,030
for holidays?

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,180
Mom.

35
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,300
I work

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,780
for myself now.

37
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,390
My schedule is flexible.

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,990
When my company stabilizes,

39
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,060
I'll be less busy.

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,180
I'll come visit you

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,030
whenever I can. Okay?

42
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
No need, no need.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,830
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

44
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,900
No need.

45
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,710
Look at how nicely you're dressed.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,710
Mom.

47
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,040
This...

48
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,390
Who gave you so much money?

49
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,340
It's not from someone else. It's mine.

50
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,740
What?

51
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,150
You sent me money last time.

52
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,110
I haven't spent it yet.

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,950
No need, no need.

54
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,870
Mom.

55
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,590
This money is not for you.

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,620
Later,

57
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,110
give this red envelope
to your daughter-in-law

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,340
as a meeting gift.

59
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,780
So much?

60
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,590
Beijing girls don't care
about betrothal gifts,

61
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,430
but we must

62
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,660
show sincerity.

63
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,940
Isn't this sincere enough?

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,220
Since you aren't having a big wedding,

65
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,060
I can't even

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,620
recoup my gift money.

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,830
Look at tonight.

68
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,780
She isn't someone

69
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,660
who cares about formalities.

70
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,900
She's practical.

71
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,180
Mom.

72
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,500
When I save enough for a down payment,

73
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,900
I'll buy a house in Shanghai

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,180
and bring you to live with us. Okay?

75
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
I won't go.

76
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,500
The south is damp

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,980
and sticky.

78
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,590
I can't get used to it. I'm fine here.

79
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,460
How can you not get used to it?
The south is great.

80
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,540
Don't forget to give it

81
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,790
to her later, okay?

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,420
(Guest Room)

83
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,190
Here, change into slippers.

84
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
I have something to tell you.

85
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,030
Go ahead.

86
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,030
That call earlier wasn't a mistake.

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,220
It was from my ex-boyfriend.

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,300
He's on his way here.

89
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,830
We've never asked

90
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,220
about each other's past,

91
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,740
right?

92
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,630
I haven't dated anyone.

93
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,190
You know that.

94
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,390
I thought the past

95
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,220
wouldn't affect us at all,

96
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,510
but now I think you should know.

97
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,460
His name is Zhuang Guodong.

98
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,870
He's my first love.

99
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,030
Come on.

100
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,420
You go out at night often,

101
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,830
but why drag me along?

102
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,340
Exercising this late,

103
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,590
aren't you afraid you won't sleep?

104
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,390
I haven't worked out in a while.

105
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,950
I wanted you to join me.

106
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,140
You have something on your mind.

107
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,030
I don't.

108
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,710
What happened? Tell me.

109
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,990
Nothing.

110
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,500
Tell me.

111
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,030
Zhuang Guodong called me today.

112
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,830
He asked where
Fang Xiewen's hometown was.

113
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,390
Did you tell him?

114
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,100
I didn't think much about it.

115
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,710
Are you an information desk?

116
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,510
He wouldn't actually go, would he?

117
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,950
Why is he looking for you

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,510
after all these years?

119
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,630
He might know I'm getting married.

120
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,140
I get it.

121
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
What do you get?

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,670
I understand.

123
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,030
What do you understand?

124
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,300
Rose.

125
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,190
I...

126
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,230
Wear this for the photo shoot tomorrow.

127
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,830
Are we

128
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,780
still taking pictures?

129
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,510
Fang Xiewen, are you bailing on me?

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,660
No, I didn't mean that.

131
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,950
I...

132
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,740
That person...

133
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,540
Your ex...

134
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,660
He's him.

135
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,750
We're us.

136
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,390
Will my meddling

137
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,990
ruin their marriage?

138
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,780
You're underestimating Rose.

139
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,990
I'm not worried about my sister.

140
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,390
I'm worried about Fang Xiewen.

141
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,030
What do you think?

142
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,710
If...

143
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,900
If Zhuang Guodong shows up,

144
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,740
who will win?

145
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,820
You enjoy the drama, don't you?

146
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,230
Huang Zhenhua,
did you tell him on purpose?

147
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,470
What drama?

148
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,420
She's my sister.

149
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,630
Don't think I don't know your thoughts.

150
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,510
You want them to get back together.

151
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,580
You're rooting for Zhuang Guodong.

152
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,060
If I didn't want her to marry,

153
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,900
why would I deliver
her household registration book?

154
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,150
I just feel a bit sorry
for Zhuang Guodong.

155
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,510
Sorry for him?

156
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,230
Is he begging at your door?

157
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,350
Yes.

158
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,990
I can't be unbiased.

159
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,580
Look at Zhuang and Rose together.

160
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,510
They're like the figurines
on a wedding cake.

161
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,350
Perfect match.

162
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,950
Of course,

163
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,470
Fang Xiewen is good too.

164
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,940
I know you're rooting for him.

165
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,350
Nonsense.

166
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,750
What does this have to do with me?

167
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,350
Nothing to do with you.

168
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,150
It only concerns your sister.

169
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,660
She needs to handle this herself.

170
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,580
If you're so unsettled,

171
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,750
reincarnate as a girl next life

172
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,030
and marry Zhuang Guodong yourself.

173
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,230
What are you saying?

174
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,820
Don't go. Help me think.

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,540
How can I fix this?

176
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,940
Fix? I'll start
by taping your mouth shut.

177
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,740
(Exit)

178
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,590
Do you want a cab?

179
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,390
Where to? Where to?

180
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,140
Where are you?

181
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,820
I'll send you the address.

182
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,110
Come then.

183
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,110
Get in the car.

(Rose, incoming call)

206
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,590
Hello.

207
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,780
Su.

208
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Did Zhuang Guodong go there?

209
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,350
Did you tell him?

210
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,030
It was me.

211
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,300
I've already beaten him up for you.

212
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,350
What's happening over there now?

213
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,140
We met.

214
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,820
I met him with Fang Xiewen.

215
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,420
I told him I was already married,

216
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,820
and then he left.

217
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,870
Better to end it quickly, right?

218
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,390
For Zhuang Guodong,

219
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,990
yes.

220
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,940
But for Fang Xiewen,

221
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,300
it's not fair.

222
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,470
Why?

223
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,630
I let him see him

224
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,230
so he knows
I have no ties with anyone else.

225
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,990
Shouldn't that reassure him?

226
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,940
But now Fang has met him.

227
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,060
Fang has a specific person

228
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,510
to direct his jealousy, insecurity,
and inferiority at.

229
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,820
He now has a face in his mind.

230
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,110
You transferred your pressure to him.

231
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,940
You got rid of Zhuang Guodong,

232
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,300
but he can't.

233
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,590
Why?

234
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,900
I never mentioned anyone else to him.

235
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,350
Why should he feel inferior?

236
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,470
You didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,390
His inferiority is ingrained.

238
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,660
He doesn't have your sense of security,

239
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,390
and now he thinks he has a rival.

240
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,590
So what do you think

241
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,300
I can do to make him
stop thinking like this?

242
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,950
You...

243
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,270
There's nothing you can do right now.

244
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,230
Give him time

245
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,150
to process it.

246
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,060
Do you know how much trouble you caused?

247
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,510
I deeply realize my mistake.

248
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,750
Write a 5,000-word self-reflection

249
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,790
and submit it to me tomorrow.

250
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,270
Can I write less?

251
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,310
8,000.

252
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,030
Then 5,000 it is.

253
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,900
The sleeves won't be in the camera.

254
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,710
Oh, that's right.

255
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,990
Are you sure you want to do this?

256
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,310
Hurry up.

257
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,990
After the photo,
go and get the certificate.

258
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,990
Remember to come to me
for a family portrait

259
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,900
next year on the child's birthday.

260
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,470
Come on, sit.

261
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,950
Come closer.

262
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,060
Closer.

263
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,870
Give me a smile.

264
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,190
Smile, please. Here we go.

265
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,340
(Fang Xiewen)

266
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
Zhenhua.

267
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,590
Zhenhua.

268
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,840
- Zhenhua.
- What's up?

269
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,430
Get back to work, everyone.

270
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,340
Go now. Go.

271
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,380
Zhenhua, Zhenhua.

272
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,550
Get back to work.

273
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,990
What happened?

274
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,670
I heard Mr. Wang
was called in for a talk.

275
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,940
Why?

276
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,980
Embezzling money.

277
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,820
Mr. Wang doesn't seem like the type.

278
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,750
This kind of thing isn't obvious.

279
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,510
Strange.

280
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,510
He claimed to be poor to me
a few days ago,

281
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,510
saying he had no money
to renovate his mom's house.

282
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,470
Just a cover story.

283
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,380
Don't believe it.

284
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,140
Enough talk. Let's get to work.

285
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,430
What work? All our projects

286
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,670
were approved by Mr. Wang.

287
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,710
A group came early

288
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,030
and took all the computers and ledgers

289
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,710
from the finance office.
They're auditing now.

290
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,990
Do you know how much he embezzled?

291
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,420
How much?

292
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,660
I'm back.

293
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,030
Mr. Groom, you're back.

294
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,380
- Congratulations.
- Fang.

295
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,540
Here, wedding candy.

296
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,580
Congratulations.

297
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,380
- Congratulations.
- Wedding candy.

298
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,190
We must share your joy.

299
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,820
I also brought some specialties
from home.

300
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
This wedding candy

301
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,700
looks delicious.

302
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,620
Where's Miss Yimei?

303
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,780
Why are you still thinking about her?

304
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,820
She's legally protected now.

305
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,750
I didn't mean anything.

306
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,780
I wanted to invite you

307
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,670
for a meal to celebrate.

308
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,940
That sounds good.

309
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,470
She went back to work.

310
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,030
Back to work?

311
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,510
You two are work models.

312
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,120
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

313
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,110
Won't she be mad?

314
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,820
She suggested it.

315
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,780
No wedding, no honeymoon.

316
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,190
The company is busy.

317
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,460
She understands.

318
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,670
Your wife is so considerate.

319
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,820
My wife is different.

320
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,820
When she's in a good mood,

321
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,140
I have to buy her gifts to celebrate.

322
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,540
When she's in a bad mood,

323
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,620
I have to buy gifts to comfort her.

324
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,230
Our company just started,

325
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,910
and she's already eyeing my dividends.

326
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,750
I wish I could find a girlfriend

327
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,990
like Miss Yimei.

328
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,070
That would be great.

329
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,620
Keep dreaming.

330
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,140
Girls like her are rare.

331
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,310
True.

332
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,750
Zhou, come with me
to Lanxing this afternoon.

333
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,030
No problem.

334
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Based on your previous suggestions,

335
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,340
we designed the functions
into four modules.

336
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
These include user information records,

337
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,300
product complaints and feedback,

338
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,060
and events and introductions.

339
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,060
This is our design

340
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,030
(Lanxing Technology Culture Co., Ltd.)
for the event interface.

341
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,950
So, this is the overall plan

342
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,100
we made.

343
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Any valuable opinions

344
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,710
or suggestions

345
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,780
for improvement?

346
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,380
It looks pretty good.

347
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,790
What do you think?

348
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,860
I think your product design

349
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,060
is better than I expected.

350
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,820
But your development cycle is two months.

351
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,470
Can it be shorter?

352
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,820
Two months is a conservative estimate.

353
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,910
We can complete the design in six weeks.

354
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,670
But to ensure quality,

355
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,910
we need at least a week

356
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,540
for stress testing.

357
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,990
Alright, we'll follow your schedule.

358
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,750
Good.

359
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,580
(Lanxing)

360
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,380
Fang, you're amazing.

361
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,670
You talked for over two hours straight,

362
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,300
and they had no questions.

363
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,950
You covered everything

364
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,380
the client wanted.

365
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,620
I'll call Hao to share the good news.

366
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,620
No need to go back to the office today.

367
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,340
Go straight home. See you tomorrow.

368
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,590
I'm leaving then.

369
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,110
I'll go now.

370
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,420
(Zhuang Guodong)

371
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,590
Hello?

372
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,980
Okay.

373
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,140
I'll meet you at Jinjiang.

374
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,350
See you soon.

375
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,630
Please help me reschedule my flight.

376
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,860
Mr. Zhuang, you've already checked in.

377
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,850
Rescheduling is not possible.

378
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,140
Then cancel it.

379
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,380
(Domestic Departures)

380
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,860
Sir, please come in.

381
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,950
Mr. Zhang,
can you send me their materials?

382
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,620
Yes.

383
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,140
Thank you.

384
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,510
I'm meeting a friend now.

385
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,270
Talk later.

386
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,700
Take a seat.

387
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,910
The last time we met, it was rushed.

388
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,710
I forgot to give you wedding candy.

389
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,940
My apologies.

390
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,190
I was the one being rude.

391
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,380
I didn't prepare a wedding gift for you.

392
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,350
No need for that.

393
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,620
Last time we met,

394
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,710
Rose and I hadn't registered yet.

395
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,780
She told me everything

396
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,230
about you two.

397
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,110
I understand.

398
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,860
A girl as wonderful as her

399
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,510
would surely have suitors.

400
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,860
No matter how many relationships she had

401
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,430
and whoever her exes were,

402
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
that's her past.

403
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,670
I don't mind at all.

404
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,580
She's not someone who drags things out.

405
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,820
Since she decided to marry me,

406
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,230
I have no rivals.

407
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,900
Waiter.

408
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,510
Hello, what can I do for you?

409
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,060
- Order some dishes.
- Sure.

410
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,350
Smoked fish.

411
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,900
Crystal shrimp.

412
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,350
Shanghai eel threads.

413
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,460
Mr. Zhuang,

414
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
I'm not here to eat.

415
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,140
Rose is waiting for me
to cook dinner at home.

416
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,510
These are Rose's favorites.

417
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,710
Didn't you know?

418
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,340
Sir, anything else?

419
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,180
That'll be all.

420
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,380
Alright, please wait a moment.

421
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,950
When we were together,

422
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,580
no matter where we were,

423
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,060
we'd try the local specialties.

424
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,470
We ate at street stalls

425
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,300
and five-star hotels.

426
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,860
Huang Yimei has seen the world.

427
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,910
She knows what's good

428
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,750
and accepts with pleasure what's bad.

429
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,860
It's because she's accommodating.

430
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,460
It doesn't mean

431
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,860
she lacks her own standards.

432
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,180
Mr. Fang,

433
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,790
don't get me wrong.

434
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,340
I won't disturb your life.

435
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,580
I consider her a friend

436
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,220
and a family member.

437
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,430
I care about her.

438
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,230
Naturally, I'm curious about her life.

439
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,100
We are doing very well.

440
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,860
Though my company just started,

441
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,100
it's already profitable.

442
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,670
Next year, it will be even bigger.

443
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,030
That's good to hear.

444
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,300
As long as she's happy,

445
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,270
I won't have any improper thoughts.

446
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,780
Hi, can you pack these dishes to go?

447
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,100
Charge them to my room. Thank you.

448
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,310
Sure, please wait a moment.

449
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,750
Sorry

450
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,990
for delaying your dinner plans.

451
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,940
Please

452
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,820
take these to Rose.

453
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,660
Congratulations.

454
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,140
You're back.

455
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,980
I'm too late

456
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,140
to cook now,

457
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,580
so I bought something simple.

458
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,140
I was thinking of making noodles.

459
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,380
What did you buy?

460
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,940
Take a look.

461
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,860
Is this what you call "something simple"?

462
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,620
You bought all my favorites.

463
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,940
Really?

464
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,300
Good job, Mr. Fang, big spender.

465
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,050
This must've cost at least 200 yuan.

466
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,820
You're my wife.

467
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,620
You should eat well, dress well,

468
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,510
and be happy.

469
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,100
- It's a bit cold. I'll heat it up.
- Is it cold?

470
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,350
It's fine.

471
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,140
Rose,

472
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,710
I will work hard

473
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,140
so I can take you out to eat every day.

474
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,750
Who eats out every day?

475
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,340
I love the dishes you make.

476
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,850
(Notice on General Manager Appointment)

477
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,750
Tina's leaving.

478
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,230
I thought the HQ would send a new boss.

479
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,620
Didn't expect Su to take Tina's place.

480
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,910
Su's the general manager now?

481
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,820
Tina was in PR before joining Cyan.

482
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,230
Su followed her then.

483
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,750
They were both headhunted together.

484
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,270
Alright, stop it.

485
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,230
Back to work.

486
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,670
Come on. Go now.

487
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Do you still need these books?

488
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,670
No, dispose of them as you wish.

489
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,580
Here, have a drink and rest.

490
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,070
When are you leaving?

491
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,070
Tomorrow.

492
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,540
I'll see you off.

493
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,820
No need, I'm just leaving temporarily,

494
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,190
not forever.

495
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,230
No need for a big send-off.

496
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,350
What's wrong?

497
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
When I graduated,

498
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,540
my first job was working with you.

499
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,670
This is the first time.

500
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,990
First time what?

501
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,230
First time going solo?

502
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,540
First time taking the lead?

503
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,350
So what?

504
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,820
All these years,

505
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,300
I followed your style,

506
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,060
but I don't have
your international background

507
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,470
or your artistic insight.

508
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,430
But you have many good qualities

509
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,380
that I lack.

510
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,230
For instance, I have no backup.

511
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,190
So, I have nothing to lose.

512
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,030
When I first started,

513
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,990
no one understood art.

514
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,750
People thought art
couldn't be eaten or drunk,

515
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,470
seemingly irrelevant to ordinary life.

516
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,380
I was clueless too.

517
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
I stumbled along and made it to today.

518
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,950
The headquarters didn't appoint you

519
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,860
solely because of me.

520
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,230
They conducted

521
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,380
a thorough evaluation.

522
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,300
You're fully capable of this position.

523
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,980
Thank you, Tina.

524
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,950
Believe in yourself.

525
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,910
More people will recognize
your abilities.

526
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,990
But you must know,

527
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,310
no matter how hard you work

528
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,100
or how successful you become,

529
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,660
some people will always criticize you
behind your back.

530
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,910
Don't let them affect you.

531
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,670
Understood.

532
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,030
Congratulations, congratulations.

533
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,260
May your aspirations soar
like Kun and Peng!

534
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,750
Cheers!

535
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,790
Cheers!

536
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,150
Thank you.

537
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,990
To celebrate soaring aspirations,
you're treating me to this?

538
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,830
This is just the appetizer.

539
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,310
Appetizers go with champagne.

540
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,390
There will be steak later.

541
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,260
Steak goes with red wine.

542
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,190
You know,

543
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,990
when I was at the foot of the mountain,

544
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,510
a fall would at most

545
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,060
sprain an ankle.

546
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,230
But now,

547
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,140
it's a bottomless pit beneath my feet.

548
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,620
I can't even turn over in my sleep.

549
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,870
So according to you,

550
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,350
all bosses are like those

551
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,440
who sleep hanging from the eaves?

552
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,510
I don't know how they sleep,

553
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,260
but they definitely sleep less.

554
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,510
Tina left me a few projects.

555
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,540
I have to take over immediately.

556
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,700
So, I won't be able

557
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,540
to accompany you to the gym anymore.

558
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,830
Then if I want to see you in the future,

559
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,540
should I write a formal request first?

560
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,260
Cyan is a small company in Beijing,

561
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,350
with over 50 staff.

562
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,700
I can't show off to you.

563
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,180
Besides, aren't you busy too?

564
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,470
We'll always have to take a rain check.

565
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,660
I'm busy?

566
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,140
I might lose my job soon.

567
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,060
What happened?

568
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,830
Our boss got into some trouble.

569
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,700
People from above
are investigating these days.

570
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,540
Does it affect you much?

571
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,510
Not sure yet.

572
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,700
They said to wait for the results.

573
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,670
But that's off-topic.

574
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,870
Today's theme is to congratulate you.

575
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,710
Come on.

576
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,900
No matter how small your company is,

577
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,220
you're still a big boss.

578
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,140
You should have your due prestige.

579
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,220
If you need me,

580
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,580
just say the word.

581
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,740
My lady, you have my respect.

582
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,140
Shouldn't we hurry?

583
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,580
I still have to take you to bed later.

584
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,140
You're so annoying.

585
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,500
Hurry. Hurry.

586
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,460
Come in.

587
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,140
I reviewed your report.

588
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,830
Why didn't you include
the estimated approval time?

589
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,580
That needs the clearance
from the Cultural Bureau.

590
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,260
Working with government departments,

591
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,430
we can't be sure.

592
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,660
And before, Ms. Jiang

593
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,950
didn't require this from us.

594
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,190
That's the past.

595
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,740
My requirement is

596
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,990
to include an estimated completion time
for every step.

597
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,630
Ms. Su,

598
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,260
each project has uncertainties
during progress.

599
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,220
You know that.

600
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,180
Estimated completion time,

601
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,580
even if written, is not accurate.

602
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,100
I don't understand

603
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,220
why focus

604
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,460
on such trivial details.

605
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,990
Fine, fine.

606
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,950
I'll add the times and resubmit it.

607
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,510
We've secured

608
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,690
the e-book numbers for this series.

609
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,430
Our team is now contacting

610
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,200
domestic and international
distribution platforms.

611
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,380
That's great.

612
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,220
I thought you were here
just to do editing and proofreading.

613
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,310
Didn't expect you to establish
a new department

614
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,740
with high efficiency.

615
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,580
Thanks to you for securing this opportunity
with the boss.

616
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,780
It's my duty.

617
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,430
The final invoice just arrived.

618
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,140
It should be paid within this week.

619
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,350
Is this the last payment for the project?

620
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,230
Is it?

621
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,350
Yes.

622
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,830
Yes, it is.

623
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,540
Once payment is done,

624
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,690
prepare the final report
by the end of the month.

625
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,830
Make a note.

626
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,510
What's the progress
on the special children's art exhibition

627
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,510
arranged by the foundation?

628
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,700
I asked Tianruo to contact the media.

629
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,830
Any results?

630
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,350
Two newspapers have responded.

631
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,830
The TV station hasn't yet.

632
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,660
You did the project reports
for the foundation, right?

633
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,710
Yes.

634
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,630
In your team,

635
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,390
Wang Tianruo writes
the project proposals,

636
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,740
follows up on the projects,

637
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,740
and writes the final reports.

638
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,180
What do you do as the project manager?

639
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,900
I...

640
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,510
I arrange the work.

641
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,180
Arranging work isn't just lip service.

642
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,100
When a project is handed to you,

643
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,220
how do you plan to execute it?

644
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,030
What are the challenges?

645
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,660
How should the progress be managed?

646
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,030
These are questions

647
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,990
for someone of your level.

648
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,510
You are clueless about project details.

649
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,220
All information comes from Wang Tianruo.

650
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,180
You might as well let her be the manager.

651
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,030
From now on,

652
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,580
all of Han Ying's team members

653
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,140
report directly to you.

654
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,540
I'll notify HR to issue the notice later.

655
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,220
Wang Tianruo only joined us last year.

656
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,740
Her pay grade is at level 15.

657
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,090
She can't be directly
promoted to manager.

658
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,030
Pay grades are determined by performance,

659
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,540
not by years of service.

660
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,180
If a long-term employee

661
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,310
has problems with capability or attitude,

662
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,910
I won't go easy on them.

663
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,630
Alright?

664
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,830
That's all for today.

665
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,460
Meeting adjourned.

666
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,980
Ms. Han...

(Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House)

668
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,060
Mr. Fang.

669
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,060
- Mr. Fang
- I'm here.

670
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,230
Look.

671
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,180
Let me see.

672
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,990
(They say men change after marriage.)

673
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,790
(But Fang Xiewen hasn't changed.)

674
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,510
(He still takes care of me meticulously)

675
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,910
(like he did before.)

676
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,990
Have you eaten?

677
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,870
I'll eat at the office later.

678
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,310
Take your time.

679
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,790
I'm going to work.

680
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,870
- Bye, Mr. Fang.
- Bye.

681
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,020
See you, Fang.

Lin Hao went to meet a client.

685
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
He took the car.

686
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,350
Then why did you come to pick me up?

687
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,870
I could've taken the bus back.

688
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,390
I like walking with you.

689
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,700
(If there's any change,)

690
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,910
(it's that he's become clingier.)

691
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,990
(Clingy or watchful?)

692
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,060

00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,580

This is the final project report

Your department manager is Wang Tianruo.

Give it to her.
