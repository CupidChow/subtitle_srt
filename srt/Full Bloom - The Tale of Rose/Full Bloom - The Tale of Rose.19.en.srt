=Episode 19=

3
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,260
How did you get soaked like this?

4
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,820
Is something wrong?

5
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,460
Let's break up.

6
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,900
Change your clothes for dinner.

7
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,620
Someone has to take the fall for this.

8
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,710
Jason meant

9
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,150
that Zhou was the best choice.

10
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,990
But he did nothing wrong.

11
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,940
Neither did you.

12
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,220
But I'm his supervisor.

13
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,180
What can I do?

14
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,060
He just graduated

15
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,150
and still shares a place.

16
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,180
His mom is also sick recently.

17
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,990
It's my fault.

18
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm just not cut out for management.

19
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,830
The client will demand compensation.

20
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,270
The company won't give me
a recommendation letter

21
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,110
and will blame everything on me.

22
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,180
I won't be able

23
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,310
to find a job easily.

24
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,310
I don't want to drag you down.

25
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,950
Let's...

26
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,830
Let's get married.

27
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,950
Well,

28
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,270
I don't have a job now,

29
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,230
and I have no money.

30
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,780
The marriage license is only nine yuan.

31
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,230
Rose,

32
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,990
I'm not in the mood to joke.

33
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,310
I'm not joking.

34
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,660
You can find another job.

35
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,550
You can earn more money.

36
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,900
My salary

37
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,390
is enough for both of us.

38
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,500
You don't need to pity me.

39
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,950
I'm not Tiny.

40
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,060
I'm not a stray cat you picked up.

41
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,700
You don't have to
take responsibility for me.

42
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,230
Rose,

43
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,710
I...

44
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,710
I love you very much.

45
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,300
But I have nothing now.

46
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,190
Marrying you like this

47
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,510
would make me a loser.

48
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,960
Don't forget to
wash the dishes after dinner.

49
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,550
But,

50
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,380

Senior Fang,

89
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,030
what's your dream?

90
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,910
My dream?

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,390
I want to start my own company,

92
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,900
gradually grow it,

93
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,820
and

94
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,100
develop a product

95
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,750
that everyone can use.

96
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,180
Get started then.

97
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,940
I support you.

98
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,620
What is this?

99
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,660
A bank card.

100
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,590
Starting a business is fine,

101
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,710
but why give this to me?

102
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,900
For the company.

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,950
I can't use your money for that.

104
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,180
Rationally,

105
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,950
you paid my rent for three years,

106
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,300
so I should repay you.

107
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,460
Romantically,

108
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,540
I don't want to say anything mushy.

109
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,590
You've only been working
for a short time.

110
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,790
Keep it for yourself.

111
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,830
It's not much,

112
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,190
all saved from working in Beijing

113
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,750
before grad school.

114
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,860
I can't accept it.

115
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,950
No way.

116
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,590
- Boss, boss, boss.
- I really can't.

117
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,190
Can I invest in your dream?

118
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,660
Take it, Boss Fang.

119
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,940
(Industrial and Commercial Bank of China)

120
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,990
Rose,

121
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,260
thank you.

122
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,220
I won't let you down.

123
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,870
Can you

124
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,910
teach me to swim?

125
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,470
Let's go.

126
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,300
Come on.

127
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,030
Especially the third floor.

128
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,870
It's been here for decades.

129
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,820
Can we rent just one floor?

130
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,390
It's all or nothing.

131
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,700
Cyan's website
hasn't been updated in years.

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,750
He made some web page demos.

133
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,540
I'll send you the link.

134
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,380
Take a look.

135
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,630
I don't have the budget.

136
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,630
Even if I did, I wouldn't outsource
to an individual.

137
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,420
No budget, it's free.

138
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,270
If you don't like it, forget it.

139
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,300
But I trust his skills.

140
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,820
I'll be his art consultant.

141
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,190
It'll work.

142
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,060
If it's free,

143
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,110
let's give it a try.

144
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,820
That chair is still crooked
even after being fixed.

145
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Buy two new ones.

146
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,300
Our startup funds are limited.

147
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,750
We need to save where we can.

148
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,020
Right.

149
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,540
Hao,

150
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,300
send me the test results
from this afternoon.

151
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,750
I'll review them.

152
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,620
Okay.

153
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,660
You're back.

154
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,630
Why don't you turn on the lights?

155
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,870
It's bad for your eyes.

156
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,060
It's so dark already.

157
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,350
I've been testing a new version.

158
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,060
I might be busy for a while

159
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,190
and won't have time to cook.

160
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,700
It's a bit cold. I'll heat it up.

161
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,180
No need, it's fine.

162
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,190
It's fine.

163
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

164
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,140
Not at all.

165
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,140
Tired?

166
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,710
A bit,

167
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,420
but having you here
makes me feel secure.

168
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,830
Why?

169
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,150
Having you behind me

170
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,390
gives me a sense of security.

171
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,260
(From Bai Xiaohe)
Working overtime this week?

172
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,540
Want to go fishing together?

173
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,820
I steamed fish perfectly.

174
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,230
(From Bai Xiaohe)
Want to come and try?

175
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,350
Hello?

176
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,070
Hello?

177
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,140
What's wrong?

178
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,150
Nothing, nothing much.

179
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,820
Just haven't called you for a while.

180
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,580
Found a job, right?

181
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,030
Didn't I tell you last week?

182
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,110
I've been working for a few days now.

183
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,390
Yes, at a publishing house.

184
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,060
What exactly do you do?

185
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,630
Do you have something to say or not?

186
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,110
No, I do. I have something to say.

187
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,110
Well.

188
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,700
How are things with Fang?

189
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
No arguments?

190
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,920
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

191
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,950
Wait, wait.

192
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,510
I have something to tell you.

193
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,750
I saw Bai Xiaohe a few days ago.

194
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,190
Tell me.

195
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,310
What's going on?

196
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,390
Why did you come all the way here

197
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,630
for this on the weekend?

198
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,620
Stop babbling.

199
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,390
Su is my best friend.

200
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,540
I need to know what's going on.

201
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,230
You didn't tell her anything, right?

202
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,150
I came straight from the airport

203
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,540
to hear the truth from you.

204
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,740
Don't hide anything from me.

205
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,230
Xiaohe, come here.

206
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,780
Look.

207
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,350
After cleaning the fish,

208
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,390
lay ginger slices on it.

209
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,780
Once the water boils,

210
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,990
put it into steam.

211
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,540
Steam for about ten minutes,

212
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,580
and drizzle some oil before serving.

213
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,270
I thought living alone would make me

214
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,900
more self-sufficient.

215
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,030
But compared to you,

216
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,990
I see

217
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,750
that household skills

218
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,300
are really about talent.

219
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,780
Handling pots and pans

220
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,150
can't be harder than doing experiments.

221
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,820
Didn't you eat the fish you catch?

222
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
Sometimes I gave it to Professor Liang.

223
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,870
Mostly I released them.

224
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,740
Professor Liang?

225
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,620
How's he doing?

226
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,520
He's fine.

227
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,630
Still setting you up with guys?

228
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,940
Not like in my twenties.

229
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,700
His enthusiasm for matchmaking

230
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,540
has waned.

231
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,270
Do you still keep in touch with your ex?

232
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,180
No, we don't.

233
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,900
I'm single not because I can't move on,

234
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,230
but because I've moved on

235
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,780
and enjoy my freedom.

236
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,660
It's carefree

237
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,390
and quite relaxing.

238
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,780
I can see that.

239
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,350
You seem to be
very used to living alone.

240
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,420
Yes, I am.

241
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,470
I sleep whenever I want,

242
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,350
wake up whenever I want,

243
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,900
skip meals if I feel like it,

244
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,110
and don't bathe if I don't want to.

245
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,950
No one bothers me.

246
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,150
If you don't bathe for six months,

247
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,150
someone will complain.

248
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,820
Neighbors might report

249
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,390
that someone
is illegally making stinky tofu

250
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
in the building.

251
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,780
Almost done.

252
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,500
Look.

253
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,590
Now,

254
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,230
sprinkle cilantro and green onions.

255
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,180
Let it sit for a few seconds

256
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,990
for flavor.

257
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,140
There.

258
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,300
Take the fish out.

259
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,750
Be careful.

260
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,350
Pour the sauce made before

261
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,990
and hot oil

262
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,870
over it.

263
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,110
Try it.

264
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,230
Smells great.

265
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,870
Tastes good.

266
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,540
Good indeed.

267
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,580
I may not be as good at cooking as you,

268
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,230
but I think I'm quite handy.

269
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,230
I can handle

270
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,510
most small life issues,

271
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,470
except for a few unsolvable ones.

272
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,630
I enjoy being single.

273
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,150
What unsolvable issues?

274
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,900
Nothing.

275
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,110
Tell me.

276
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,390
Maybe I can help.

277
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,990
I love children.

278
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,150
I've always wanted them.

279
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,900
But...

280
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,260
What?

281
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,150
Do you want to help her have a baby?

282
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,580
What are you talking about?

283
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,660
It's a heartfelt issue.
Why make it sleazy?

284
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
Your girlfriend was not here,

285
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,580
so she invited you to go to her place,

286
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,030
cook, and discuss private matters.

287
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,590
She's crossed the line.

288
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,110
Is she sincere
or does she have an ulterior motive?

289
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,540
Doesn't she know you have a girlfriend?

290
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,630
I didn't tell her I have a girlfriend.

291
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,470
Don't mess around in the lab

292
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,780
to make a baby.

293
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,750
Sci-fi movies show

294
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,270
that scientists create many monsters.

295
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,990
Don't worry. I can't do that.

296
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,300
But the thought

297
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,990
of needing to date

298
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,780
and marry a man first to have a child

299
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,350
seems

300
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,740
troublesome.

301
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,700
I wonder

302
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,990
if I'll regret it in a few years,

303
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,980
or compromise

304
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,060
with reality.

305
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,030
Don't think about unsolvable things.

306
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,100
At least today, I'm happy.

307
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,510
You fished and talked with me

308
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,780
and taught me to cook.

309
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,070
Thank you.

310
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,460
You're welcome.

311
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,190
Oh, I forgot.

312
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,060
I have a video meeting scheduled.

313
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,590
I need to go.

314
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,860
Stay for dinner.

315
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,060
No, I'm late.

316
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,580
Work is important.

317
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,510
I won't keep you.

318
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,190
If you can't finish the fish,

319
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,030
put it in the fridge.

320
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,030
Reheat it in the microwave tomorrow.

321
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,580
I see steaming isn't that hard.

322
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
I'll try it in a few days.

323
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,230
When I get it right, I'll invite you over.

324
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,460
Okay.

325
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,510
I'm really late. I have to go.

326
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,510
Take care.

327
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,140
So, there was no chance.

328
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,980
Besides,

329
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,710
talking to a loner about this

330
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,140
feels like showing off.

331
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,950
Don't look at me like that.

332
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,100
I really didn't do anything.

333
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,620
You didn't do anything.

334
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,140
You didn't tell Bai Xiaohe
you have a girlfriend.

335
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,230
You didn't tell Su
you met Bai Xiaohe again.

336
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,990
I'm just dating her.

337
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,820
Do I have to report every detail

338
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,620
of who I see and what I do?

339
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,510
You should share the important things.

340
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,900
Well.

341
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,860
Did she tell you she bought a house?

342
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,860
I only found out

343
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,730
after she paid the deposit.

344
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,750
I feel like I'm not in her future plans.

345
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,270
I admit that going fishing
with Bai Xiaohe

346
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,300
was partly out of spite,

347
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,430
but I swear
I didn't think of anything else.

348
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,580
Su is different from us.

349
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,780
The house is her way of feeling secure.

350
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,300
I understand.

351
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,540
That's why I regret it.

352
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,780
I feel really guilty now.

353
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,710
If you miss the chance to apologize,

354
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,710
it will become a different issue.

355
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,380
So, let's not tell her about it.

356
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,860
I promise I won't see her again.

357
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,460
I'm telling you.

358
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,990
My flight is at 6 pm tomorrow.

359
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,470
Either you confess

360
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,670
before then,

361
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
or I'll expose you.

362
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,540
Fine, I'll confess tomorrow.

363
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,950
I'll confess tomorrow, okay?

364
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,620
Zhenhua,

365
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,530
are you doing well financially lately?

366
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,910
I knew

367
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,780
you wouldn't come all this way
just for this.

368
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,380
If you have extra money, lend me more.

369
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,060
If not, a little will do.

370
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,750
What happened?

371
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,860
It's not about your boyfriend, is it?

372
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,780
Spending money on a man is a big no-no.

373
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,670
It's for me.

374
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Serious stuff.

375
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,460
I'll pay you back in installments
over six months.

376
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,310
Here's your IOU.

377
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,230
(Signature of borrower: Huang Yimei)

378
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,430
You even came prepared.

379
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,550
How much do you need?

380
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,700
How much do you have?

381
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,470
As much as I can spare?

382
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,060
Seems like confessing now is too late.

383
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,140
If you want to break up with me now,

384
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,780
I'd understand.

385
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,540
Hearing you say this,

386
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,270
I feel a complex mix of emotions.

387
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,350
Disappointment,

388
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,750
jealousy,

389
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,190
and a bit of anger.

390
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,380
I've never felt

391
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,950
such strong emotions for anyone.

392
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,470
A long time ago,
Rose asked me a question.

393
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,310
She asked

394
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,860
if there's a switch in the human brain

395
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,620
that controls emotions,

396
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,140
allowing you to start

397
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,510
or stop liking someone at will.

398
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,670
Back then, I couldn't answer it

399
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,540
because I didn't know.

400
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,980
Well,

401
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,430
now,

402
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,230
I can be sure.

403
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,140
Emotions

404
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,140
can't be turned off by sheer will.

405
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,140
Like

406
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,430
I know you saw the girl

407
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,950
you once liked behind my back.

408
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,950
Though it hurts,

409
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,830
I can't

410
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,380
stop liking you

411
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,670
because the switch is already on.

412
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,030
But relationships are mutual.

413
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,540
If one side feels uncomfortable,

414
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,270
they can choose to end it.

415
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,950
I don't want to break up

416
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,710
because I really like you a lot.

417
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,860
But this

418
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,910
is my wish,

419
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,430
my choice.

420
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,230
You can have yours too.

421
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,420
No need to choose.

422
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,860
I want to be with you.

423
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,380
I want to.

424
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,110
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,900
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,950
If you agree

427
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,430
that Bai Xiaohe is part of your past,

428
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,380
then I think

429
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,510
this can be

430
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,380
a milestone in our relationship.

431
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,340
Because it made me

432
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,750
see my feelings for you more clearly.

433
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,190
Thank you for the stone.

434
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,030
No, no.

435
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
The milestone.

436
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,620
This part is just...

437
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,510
- Let's finish this later.
- Take a break.

438
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,270
Here you are.

439
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,210
This is much better
and more comfortable.

440
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,790
Milk tea?

441
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,830
Thanks.

442
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,820
Sit down first. Come, come.

443
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,710
This is the homepage interface for Cyan.

444
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,140
Give me some feedback.

(Cyan Art Co., Ltd.)

446
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,580
These two pages are parallel, right?

447
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,570
The background color contrast
is too strong.

448
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,620
You'd better use the same template

449
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,380
and adjust the shades.

450
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,350
What do you think?

451
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,590
You're right.

452
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,460
I'll change it right away.

453
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,700
Here.

454
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,660
Thank you.

Fang.

459
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,860
Later, the network department
checked the server logs.

460
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,300
Jason's account
logged in on the release day.

461
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,870
It was definitely him.

462
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,030
Why did he do it?

463
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,580
It's still unclear.

464
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,910
Some say they saw
a scratched CD in his trash,

465
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,190
suspecting he accidentally scratched it

466
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,820
and then burned a new one,

467
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,910
mixing them up.

468
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,870
Others say

469
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,380
he did it on purpose

470
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,540
because Mr. Shao values Fang

471
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,510
and Jason feared
Fang would take his place.

472
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,650
None of that matters anymore.

473
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,270
Actually,

474
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
I should thank him.

475
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,990
If I hadn't taken the blame,

476
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,430
I wouldn't have left the high-paying job

477
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,700
at the big company.

478
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,510
A blessing in disguise.

479
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,550
Follow him

480
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,820
and he'll make sure we live well.

481
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,750
Stop that.

482
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,790
Fang,

483
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,580
I know

484
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,540
Jason originally wanted me to leave.

485
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,940
It wasn't your fault.

486
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,310
In the company,

487
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,580
my happiest moments

488
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,220
were working with you.

489
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,710
The new leader
isn't doing much good either.

490
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,620
Lately, it's been all meetings.

491
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,140
Now I spend more time

492
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,710
writing reports than coding.

493
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,300
At least the salary is high.

494
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,790
Fang,

495
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,670
is there anything

496
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,190
I can help with here?

497
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,510
Well...

498
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,820
You're the boss.

499
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm okay with it.

500
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,510
But I can't

501
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,990
offer a high salary.

502
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,140
No problem.

503
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,060
What matters is working with you.

504
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,430
I... I really...

505
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,300
Why don't you

506
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,870
come over and try?

507
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,900
Thank you, Fang.

508
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,830
Thank you, Miss Yimei.

509
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,870
Thank you, Hao.

510
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,430
I will definitely work hard.

511
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,700
Here's a toast to everyone.

512
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

513
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,670
Alright, I can rest easy
knowing you've forgiven him.

514
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,270
Maybe it's because I've seen
the ugliness of human nature.

515
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,620
Your brother's minor flaws
are acceptable.

516
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,540
My brother is so lucky

517
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,540
to find such a generous girlfriend
like you.

518
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,100
If I can't stand
a grain of sand in my eye,

519
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,230
I might as well just keep them shut.

520
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,990
Okay, I've got work. Gotta go.

521
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,790
Yimei.

522
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,110
Yimei.

523
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,830
I've finished the book
you borrowed me last time.

524
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,830
Okay.

525
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,470
This is for you.

526
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,220
I'm too lazy to wrap it.

527
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,470
Anyway, you don't care
about appearances.

528
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,380
I don't know how to fish.

529
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,910
Why give me a fishing rod?

530
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,750
I can teach you.

531
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,030
You want me to show off
in front of Bai Xiaohe?

532
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,860
No need to do that.

533
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,140
Your banner has already been planted

534
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,670
on my city gate tower.

535
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,460
I told her

536
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,830
I have a girlfriend now.

537
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,580
Last time you said

538
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,990
fishing is my personal space.

539
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,830
You won't interfere.

540
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,580
But there's no need to avoid it, right?

541
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,540
You said I can fish with anyone I like.

542
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,700
Then

543
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,510
I want to fish with you.

544
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,510
And this fishing rod.

545
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,910
You can use it to fish,

546
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,710
or even hit me with it
when you're upset.

547
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,990
Is fishing fun?

548
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,270
You have to try it.

549
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,780
You might get hooked after just one try.

550
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,470
Even if you don't like it,

551
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
when I'm fishing,

552
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,670
you can enjoy the sun and read a book.

553
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,580
Just don't disturb the fish
when they're biting.

554
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,580
Alright then.

555
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,060
I'll accept this gift.

556
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,660
Thank you.

557
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,220
You're the one who's got a gift.

558
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,190
Why am I happier than you?

559
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,580
(2007/Spring, Gulou)

560
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,780
You can get off at the door.

561
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,510
I'm coming out.

562
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,990
Your son is back.

563
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,830
Yeah.

564
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,600
You have luggage.

565
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,510
Come on.

566
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,430
No need. Let me.

567
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,420
Come on, give it to me.

568
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,460
Give it to me.

569
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,660
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

570
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,310
Thank you.

571
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,830
- No problem.
- Let's go.

572
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,430
- You're back.
- He's back.

573
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,830
Ms. Yuan.

574
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,870
- You're back.
- He's back.

575
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,550
- Uncle Jia.
- Here, here.

576
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,620
Come on.

577
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,900
Give it to me.

578
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,750
You must be thirsty.

579
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,900
Same as always.

580
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,140
Nothing's changed at all.

581
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,500
(Galaxy Cup, Outstanding Work Award)

582
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,340
(First Prize)

583
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,820
(Outstanding Novel Award)

584
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,700
From last year.

585
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,590
Here you go.

586
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,070
Thank you.

587
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,230
Have you grown taller?

588
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,310
Look.

589
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,540
Dad, I'm over thirty.
How can I get taller?

590
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,100
That's just me being silly.

591
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,940
Let's eat.

592
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,670
I've prepared everything. Let's go.

593
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,700
Come help me bring it over.

594
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,670
Dad, your kitchen cabinet
is about to fall off.

595
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,950
This house has been lived in
for many years.

596
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,430
It's time to renovate.

597
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,060
Renovate what?

598
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,340
I'm used to living alone.

599
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,340
Exactly because you live alone,

600
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,030
you need to tidy up properly.

601
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,620
All these old and broken things
are safety hazards.

602
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,220
I'll pay for it.

603
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,340
It's not about money.

604
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,380
This is public housing.

605
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,540
We don't have property rights.

606
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,340
Who knows when it'll be demolished?

607
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,830
No need to renovate.

608
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,310
Try this.

609
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,910
I'll fix the cabinet for you later.

610
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,910
- Try the lamb.
- Thank you.

611
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,750
Wait. Let's have a drink first.

612
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,540
Congratulations on your promotion.

613
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,660
Is it tasty?

614
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,180
Delicious.

615
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,300
Is it just you now?

616
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,580
Who else could there be?

617
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,420
Try the fish.

618
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,340
No one comes to see you?

619
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,300
Sometimes editors and reporters

620
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,590
come looking for me.

621
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,470
But I always arrange
to meet them outside.

622
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,570
During festivals and holidays,

623
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,270
no one comes to visit you?

624
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,780
You're asking about Rose, aren't you?

625
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,710
During Chinese New Year three years ago,

626
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,430
we talked on the phone.

627
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,620
I wanted to help
make peace between you two,

628
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,100
but she didn't respond.

629
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,380
Since then,

630
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,140
we've been in touch.

631
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
During holidays,

632
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,270
she sends me a text message

633
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,790
to wish me well.

634
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,460
Polite and formal.

635
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,230
When I won an award back then,

636
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,340
she called to congratulate me.

637
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,700
Suddenly,

638
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,230
things weren't so formal anymore.

639
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,230
I asked, and sure enough,

640
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,460
she has a boyfriend now.

641
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,340
Dad, where's your phone?

642
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,710
Let me see your messages.

643
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,860
She's put the past behind her.

644
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,820
Let me see it.

645
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,900
Where's your phone?

646
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,710
You're in your thirties now.

647
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,510
I won't rush you about marriage.

648
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,190
As for your feelings,

649
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,990
(Huang Yimei)
you can't keep floating like this.

650
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,700
(Uncle Zhuang: May every day of the new year
be bathed in the sunshine of happiness.)

651
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,730
(Uncle Zhuang:
May you be safe, healthy, happy, and joyful.)

652
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,180
After I fix the cabinet doors,

653
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,190
I'll head back to the hotel.

654
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,620
(Huang Yimei)

655
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,830
(May you have a prosperous new year.)
Aren't you going back to your place?

656
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,540
I'll need to tidy up there.

657
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,590
Staying at a hotel is more convenient.

658
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,910
Besides, I can't stay long
in Beijing this time.

659
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,060
I'll be visiting several cities on this trip.

660
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,870
Where are you going?

661
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,750
Stop asking.

662
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,230
Will you go to Shanghai?

663
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,430
Don't go looking for her.

664
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,030
It's been many years.

665
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,180
She's moved on with her life.

666
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,060
Don't disturb her.

667
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,350
Come on.

668
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,390
- Take a look.
- How's this? Look good?

669
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,990
The tie is a bit off.

670
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,350
Doesn't it match?

671
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,630
Well.

672
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,870
Isn't this too flashy?

673
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,350
Try this one?

674
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,740
Who are you meeting today,
a female client?

675
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,710
Manager of Lanxing's
After-sales Department.

676
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,900
They want

677
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,660
to develop a customer service system.

678
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,790
If I can secure this project,

679
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,310
I could earn at least this much this year.

680
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,870
If it goes through,

681
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,060
I might need to hire two more people.

682
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,510
Right now, the three of us
handle both sales and development.

683
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,540
We can manage small projects,

684
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,750
but big clients

685
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,230
all have dedicated customer service.

686
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,580
Good luck with that.

687
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,910
I'll design recruitment ads for you.

688
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,100
Really?

689
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,380
Alright.

690
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,310
Good eye.

691
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,830
It's a male.

692
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,700
The client is male.

693
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,180
(Manager's Office)

694
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,670
Tina, you wanted to see me?

695
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,630
Ms. Su.

696
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,710
Hello.

697
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,220
Eric is currently
the Operations Director

698
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,060
at Galant's French headquarters.

699
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,660
He has a project

700
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,950
and wants to collaborate with us.

701
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,100
You'll be in charge.

702
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,830
Alright, Mr. Zhuang.

703
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,310
Let's discuss it in the reception room.

704
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
I need to review the documents again.

705
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,030
I'll prepare a budget
and risk assessment report

706
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,100
to submit to the headquarters.

707
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,140
I'll need their feedback first.

708
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,140
I'll give you an answer

709
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,910
about whether we can cooperate
next week.

710
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,500
I really want to cooperate with Cyan.

711
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,740
If you think

712
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,260
something's wrong with our terms,

713
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,870
we can always negotiate.

714
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,180
Sure. I'll tell you next week.

715
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,150
Ms. Su,

716
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,830
I have something else to ask you.

717
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,790
Rose has left our company.

718
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,660
She resigned four or five years ago.

719
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,790
She has no ties to our company.

720
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,260
But you're her best friend.

721
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,430
You've been gone so long.

722
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,790
Why bring her up now?

723
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,310
Because you've made it big

724
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,150
and found success?

725
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,140
I understand you want
to protect your friend.

726
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,740
She was the one
who initiated the breakup

727
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,750
and blocked me.

728
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
Even if I wanted to reconcile,

729
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,160
I wouldn't have had the chance.

730
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,350
If you wanted to reconcile,

731
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,540
you'd always had the chance.

732
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,100
It was just about a plane ticket.

733
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,100
Back then, it wasn't.

734
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,790
It was about my job and future.

735
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,020
I couldn't risk it.

736
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,060
What do you want to know?

737
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,660
If I go to her now,

738
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,940
what would she think?

739
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,870
I want to hear your opinion.

740
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,350
I don't know.

741
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,740
After all, I'm not her.

742
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,830
Does she still hate me?

743
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,660
She's never hated you.

744
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,030
Hatred only complicates things.

745
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,380
She doesn't want
to be entangled with you.

746
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,430
Though I'm her friend,

747
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,030
I believe

748
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,310
in matters of work and love,

749
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,870
when you can only choose one,

750
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,950
either choice is understandable.

751
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,100
You weren't wrong.

752
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,390
But since you've made your choice,

753
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,030
don't expect
to have both fish and bear paws.

754
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,350
That's exactly what I think.

755
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,830
Almost done.

756
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,060
Alright, I'll head over first.

757
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,540
Both plans are viable.

758
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,100
One is high-risk with high returns,

759
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,390
and the other is safer

760
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,510
but with less profit.

761
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,220
If you were the manager,

762
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,630
which would you choose?

763
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,670
The first one.

764
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,140
Our fiscal year starts in March,

765
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,140
and this project
is the highlight of the year.

766
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,950
Even if it exceeds the budget,

767
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,020
we still have a chance to recover
in the second half of the year.

768
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Then proceed with that.

769
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,350
If there are any issues,

770
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,900
you can communicate
with the headquarters.

771
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,390
I'm resigning.

772
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,210
I recommended you to the headquarters

773
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,430
to take over my position.

774
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,230
Tina.

775
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,270
It's personal reasons.

776
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,740
Last month, you asked me to find buyers

777
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,620
for your two paintings.

778
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,350
Are you short on money?

779
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,060
If you were going solo,

780
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,580
you'd surely ask if I wanted to join you.

781
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,500
So,

782
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,660
what difficulties are you facing?

783
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,870
It's not me.

784
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,230
It's Gu.

785
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,030
He's ill,

786
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,140
alone in Hong Kong, China,

787
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,140
with not much time left.

788
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,520
I plan to go there to accompany him.

789
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,830
But the company's headquarters

790
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,180
are in Hong Kong, China.

791
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,310
You could apply for a transfer.

792
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,030
I don't want others and other things

793
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,870
to disturb us.

794
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,450
I just want
to focus on accompanying him.

795
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,430
I still have two paintings there.

796
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,470
If I need money later,

797
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,510
sell them for me.

798
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,100
Isn't Gu wealthy?

799
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,700
His parents are still alive,

800
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,990
and he has an ex-wife and a daughter.

801
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,660
If I go now, everyone will think

802
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,950
I'm going after his inheritance.

803
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,310
We're divorced.

804
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,390
His money has nothing to do with me.

805
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,140
Gu is the most important person to me.

806
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,030
I just want to accompany him

807
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,470
through this final journey in peace.

808
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,100
Alright.

809
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,740
Leave the company to me.

810
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,710
You go ahead.

811
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,570
I'm capable of taking over from you.

812
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,220
Every time you get a promotion and raise,

813
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,040
there's always someone
saying I favor you.

814
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,430
But they don't know

815
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,940
that in hiring,

816
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,870
what I value most
is confidence and courage.

817
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,260
Only those brave enough
to take responsibility

818
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,950
are qualified to make demands of me.

819
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,910
That's why you
valued Huang Yimei back then.

820
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,350
Eric's here this time

821
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,100
for Huang Yimei, right?

822
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,030
Judging by his demeanor,
he'll probably go see her.

823
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,660
I was just thinking.

824
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,580
Should I give her a call to remind her?

825
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,870
She's not suited

826
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,510
for calm and quiet days.

827
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,350
Even if she doesn't want to,

828
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,990
there will be troublemakers.

829
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,660
You can remind her once,

830
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,130
but you can't keep
reminding her every time.

831
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,790
Let her face it herself.

832
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,870
After all, she's Huang Yimei.
