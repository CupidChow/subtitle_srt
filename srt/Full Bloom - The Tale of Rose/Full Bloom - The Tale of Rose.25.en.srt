=The Tale of Rose=

2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,410
Every day, there is

4
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,770
pork trotter soup and crucian carp.

5
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,820
She drinks so much soup,

6
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,120
but she does not have much milk.

7
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,720
How much does a can of milk powder cost?

8
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,980
That's just a girl.

9
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,020
You don't need to raise her so lavishly.

10
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,410
That's my daughter.

11
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,760
Of course, I have to raise her lavishly.

12
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,610
By the way, Mom,

13
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,920
we've decided on a name for the baby.

14
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,760
Fang Taichu.

15
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,230
We consulted a master for it.

16
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,710
Consulting a master for a name?

17
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,670
That must have cost a lot.

18
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,820
She's just a girl.

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,500
She'll belong to someone else sooner or later.

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,360
It's unnecessary.

21
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,990
I work all day long now.

22
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,610
If I were taking care of a grandson,

23
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,990
I wouldn't mind the hard work.

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,080
But I have to take care of both of them.

25
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,440
I can't handle this.

26
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,220
I want to go back home.

27
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,180
Mom,

28
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,940
we need help right now.

29
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,880
How can you leave?

30
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,320
Why can't I leave?

31
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,990
The Mahjong room
has been closed for over a year.

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,780
Your aunt called yesterday,

33
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,830
asking when I'll be back.

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,020
What's more important,

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,820
the Mahjong room or your grandson?

36
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,180
Where is this grandson?

37
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,740
We can have another one in a few years.

38
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
Would you take care of him?

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,180
As if you can have one just like that.

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,860
Mom,

41
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,700
when we're better off,

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,780
we'll have another one.

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,460
Alright.

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,740
Son, do you want two or three kids?

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,340
Don't laugh. How many do you want?

46
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,660
Sure, we can have them.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,540
If you're too busy then,

48
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,220
I'll hire a part-time helper

49
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,460
to assist you during the day.

50
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,260
Why waste money on that?

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,700
Isn't your mother-in-law coming to help?

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Let her come,

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
so I can go home.

54
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,380
When I have a grandson,

55
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,060
- I'll come back.
- Why is it so hot?

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,300
It's so humid and hot in Shanghai.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,340
You're here.

58
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,620
- Mrs. Fang.
- Hello, Mrs. Fang.

59
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,500
You're here.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,020
Zhenhua and I came to see Rose.

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,340
Sure.

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,340
They're upstairs.

63
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,300
Alright, we'll head up first.

64
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,420
It's so narrow here.

65
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,100
Why are you so late?

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,220
Your brother bought fresh meat mooncakes
from Guangming Village.

67
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,260
He queued for ages.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,100
Eat them while they're hot.

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,220
Zhenhua, aren't you the boss now?

70
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,700
Why are you always so idle,

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,020
running to Shanghai every few days?

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,140
Don't flatter yourself.

73
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm not here to see you.

74
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,260
I'm here with my girlfriend
for her business trip.

75
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,820
Just dropping by to see my niece.

76
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,660
Who are you?

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,220
If you don't recognize me, put the baby down.

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,660
Our little girl is so pretty.

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,420
Big eyes, a high nose,
and a small cherry mouth.

80
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,500
Clearly, she inherited

81
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,980
our family's good genes.

82
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,460
Good thing she doesn't take after her dad.

83
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,700
Keep your voice down.

84
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,140
- Right?
- Little baby.

85
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,900
Your brother's company

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,860
just got started recently.

87
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,700
Yuan Zheng is handling all the paperwork.

88
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,500
He has to go back in a few days.

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,860
Once it officially opens,
it'll be hard for him to come again.

90
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm so envious of you all,

91
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,180
having work to do.

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
What's the big deal?

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,660
When this little girl grows up,

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,180
you can go back to work too.

95
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,740
It'll be a piece of cake for you.

96
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,660
If no one hires you, come to my company.

97
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
I'll make you work overtime every day.

98
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,060
I'll personally scold you.

99
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,220
Right, little girl?

100
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,740
Who's a little girl?

101
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,820
She has a name, Taichu.

102
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,060
Fang Taichu?

103
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,020
Not a good name.

104
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,740
Sounds like a Taoist nun.

105
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
Fang Taichu.

106
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,260
What Taoist nun?

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,300
What's all that sizzling?

108
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
Does it smell bad to you?

109
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,420
Hold on.

110
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,500
Slow down.

111
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

112
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,460
Fang Taichu sounds nice.

113
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,140
Really nice.

114
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,380
Here.

115
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,900
Come in, Mom.

116
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,020
Let me listen. What's wrong with that?

117
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,220
Every time they come, it's chaotic.

118
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
My gosh, it's so noisy.

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,740
And they call themselves intellectuals?

120
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,620
Where are their manners?

121
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,140
What's going on?

122
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,100
Does she think she's too idle now?

123
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,340
Does she need to go back to work?

124
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,820
They're just talking.

125
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,660
Don't believe them.

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,420
Why don't you have her give you a son?

127
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,140
So she'll have better things to do.

128
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,260
She just finished her confinement.

129
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,820
It's too soon to talk about that.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,100
Many families have children close together.

131
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,940
One is the same as two.

132
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,180
If she has another one soon,
I'll have fewer years of trouble.

133
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,420
Mom, where are you going now?

134
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,380
I'll go check on your wife's

135
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,100
pork trotter soup and crucian soup.

136
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,980
Make sure they don't boil dry.

137
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,460
Even changing diapers looks enjoyable.

138
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,740
Do you know how to do this?

139
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,620
Don't forget I have a younger brother.

140
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,300
Back then, there were no disposable diapers.

141
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,540
I washed all the cloth diapers.

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,420
By the way, Zhenhua,

143
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,580
did you tell Mom?

144
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,620
When are they coming?

145
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,500
They missed the birth.

146
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Isn't it time for them to come?

147
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,700
They...

148
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,020
They are planning it.

149
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,260
They didn't tell me.

150
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,460
You should tell her.

151
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,020
What's wrong?

152
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,580
Did something happen at home?

153
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,860
Don't panic.

154
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,980
Well.

155
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,620
Dad

156
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,300
had a fall.

157
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,580
Had a fall?

158
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,900
Where did he hurt?

159
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,260
How did it happen? Is it serious?

160
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,260
He slipped while going down the stairs

161
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,220
and broke his lower leg.

162
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,060
He's much better now.

163
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,140
The cast is off,

164
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,460
but it's still inconvenient for him to go out.

165
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

166
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,660
You had just given birth.

167
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,100
No one wanted to worry you.

168
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,660
When I left this time,

169
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,100
they repeatedly told me

170
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,180
to keep it from you,

171
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
but Su said we should tell you.

172
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,820
You...

173
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,500
What are you doing?

174
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,380
Don't call, please.

175
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,620
Pretend you don't know anything,

176
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,260
or else they will worry

177
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,100
that you might stop lactating.

178
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,420
Stay calm.

179
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,300
Why did Rose lose weight so quickly?

180
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,220
She needs to gain some weight.

181
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,700
Are you leaving now?

182
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,260
Yes.

183
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
Ms. Su,

184
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,620
if you're not busy this afternoon,

185
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,900
I'd like you two to visit my new company.

186
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,620
Sure, I have some things to discuss with you.

187
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,860
Send me the address,

188
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
I'll come this afternoon.

189
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,740
Okay.

190
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,660
Bye.

191
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,580
Let's go.

192
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,820
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

193
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,740
Who left this here?

194
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,940
What a terrible place.

195
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,140
Is this even suitable for living?

196
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,540
Rose carries the baby up and down all day.

197
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,740
It's so dangerous.

198
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,700
Stop yelling.

199
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,980
They already bought a house.

200
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,900
With so many houses in Shanghai,

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,940
he bought a pre-sale property

202
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,100
instead of a ready one.

203
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,060
It can only be handed over next year.

204
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,620
Renovations and airing out
need another six months.

205
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Why can't he rent a better place now?

206
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,340
Keep your voice down.

207
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,580
If he won't rent, I'll rent.

208
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,060
Are you free? Come and look at houses with me.

209
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,980
Fang Xiewen scheduled a visit to his company.

210
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,820
Are you coming?

211
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,380
I don't need to see his show-off.

212
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,740
I'll pay

213
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,100
to rent a good place for my sister and niece.

214
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,540
It's worth every penny.

215
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,100
This isn't your responsibility.

216
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,740
I know you don't like
meddling in others' affairs.

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,500
But she's my sister and your best friend.

218
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,380
How can you ignore this?

219
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,220
I won't handle it this way.

220
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,180
Fine, don't interfere,

221
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,060
but don't stop me either.

222
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
Alright.

223
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,580
Wait.

224
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,140
Why are you angry?

225
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,180
Ms. Su, this way.

226
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,980
You don't need to call me that.

227
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,620
We're not discussing work today.

228
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,540
Then I'll call you Su?

229
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,420
Sure.

230
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,060
(Yifang Tiandi Technology Co., Ltd.)

231
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
So big.

232
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,180
We moved in last month.

233
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,460
Some custom furniture hasn't arrived yet,

234
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,140
but everything else is set up.

235
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,100
Looks great.

236
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,980
This way.

237
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,260
This is our break room for employees.

238
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,900
Nice view.

239
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
There's a park below.

240
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,780
Let me show you there.

241
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,820
This is our East Office.

242
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,980
In just two years,

243
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,220
you've expanded so much.

244
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,660
Your wife really picked the right person.

245
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,020
I just want to show her

246
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,860
I can give her

247
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,220
what others can,

248
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,300
and I will give her

249
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,900
what others can't.

250
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,780
Your ability is evident.

251
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,380
Clear goals and decisive decisions.

252
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,420
I have high hopes for your career.

253
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,380
Do you need help with your personal life?

254
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,860
No, no.

255
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,660
Most of our money

256
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,100
is invested in the company,

257
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,020
but I make sure

258
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,140
they're well taken care of.

259
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,190
Ms. Su,

260
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,380
if you're not busy,

261
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,980
I can show you my new house.

262
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,820
How about it?

263
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,700
I'm not here to check on you.

264
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,900
This visit is out of care.

265
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,660
This is my office. Please come in.

266
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,180
Have a seat.

267
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,900
Coffee or tea?

268
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,100
- Either is fine.
- Sure.

269
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,460
Ms. Su.

270
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,100
Here's your tea.

271
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,380
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

272
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,580
Ms. Su,

273
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,140
thank you

274
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,900
for enlightening me back then.

275
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,820
You told me not to feel inferior.

276
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,140
I've made it.

277
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,060
I've made some achievements,

278
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,500
and I'm no longer insecure.

279
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,420
The sense of control
can build confidence gradually.

280
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,380
That's good.

281
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm a bit older than you.

282
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,580
Let me share some thoughts.

283
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,380
Go ahead.

284
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
Use your control

285
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,900
on tasks,

286
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,820
not on people,

287
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,420
especially family.

288
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
Rose.

289
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,940
Dad,

290
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,140
what are you doing?

291
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,820
Just took your mom for a walk.

292
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,740
I'm about to take a shower.

293
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,620
Today,

294
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,540
we named your granddaughter.

295
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,460
She's called

296
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,620
Fang Taichu.

297
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,260
Taichu.

298
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,180
In the beginning, there was nothing.

299
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,300
A great name, very grand.

300
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
She will surely grow up

301
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,100
to be a broad-minded girl.

302
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,780
Dad,

303
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,740
how's your leg?

304
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,260
Your brother's mouth

305
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,500
is like a sieve.

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
Dad,

307
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,660
you should have told me about the accident.

308
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,180
It's not serious, almost healed.

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,100
In a few days, I'll be back

310
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,260
to dance with your mom's choir.

311
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,820
You're lying.

312
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,020
Didn't you faint when you were pregnant?

313
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,500
And you didn't tell me.

314
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,380
Alright then.

315
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,460
We're even now.

316
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,340
Hello? Rose?

317
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,780
Dad,

318
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,140
I miss you all so much.

319
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,460
You must take care.

320
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,820
Yes.

321
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,660
We all need to take care.

322
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,860
What do you think

323
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,940
the Olympics will be like?

324
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,540
I'll be twenty-nine by then.

325
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,700
So old.

326
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,820
Twenty-nine. If you're lucky,

327
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,860
you'll have a successful career.

328
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,660
If not,

329
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,900
it's not too late to start over.

330
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,460
It's an age where you can do anything.

331
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,500
How great.

332
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,900
What will I be like then?

333
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,460
I can't imagine.

334
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,340
Neither can I.

335
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,620
But I hope that by then,

336
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,780
you will still be Huang Yimei.

337
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,340
Of course, I'll still be Huang Yimei,

338
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,180
I'm not changing my name.

339
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,940
I mean the name Huang Yimei

340
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,740
will always represent the real you,

341
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,540
not dependent on anyone or any environment.

342
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,500
Yuan Zheng is handling the business license.

343
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,100
It might take some time.

344
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,980
We can't wait any longer.

345
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,620
We need to start working immediately.

346
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,860
The office isn't urgent.

347
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,100
It's just the three of us.

348
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,540
If needed, we can continue working at my place.

349
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,300
Yes, I'm working at your home.

350
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,900
By the way,

351
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,180
a friend recommended someone,

352
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,580
named Fu Jiamin.

353
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,020
He's your junior from college.

354
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,460
He just left his company

355
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,540
and wanted to try working with us.

356
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Then let's arrange to meet him.

357
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,980
Sure.

358
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
Are you still in Shanghai?

359
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,780
Going back in a few days.

360
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,100
How's Rose?

361
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
Zhou Shihui!

362
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,540
I warned you.

363
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,820
Yes.

364
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,740
I'm just concerned.

365
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,460
I won't bother her.

366
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,380
Don't show unnecessary concern.

367
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,940
Don't make me regret letting you return.

368
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,940
I was just asking.

369
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,180
What did you buy?

370
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,020
Don't touch.

371
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,220
Did you find a house?

372
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,980
It's not that easy to find.

373
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,100
Besides,

374
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,980
didn't you disagree?

375
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,340
Do you know why I disagreed?

376
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,300
Tell me.

377
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,180
First,

378
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,260
what kind of house they live in

379
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,540
is their business.

380
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,580
Even if you're paying,

381
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,220
you should give the money to Rose

382
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,300
and let her decide.

383
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,050
Second,

384
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,490
do you think moving is a game?

385
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,380
Rose just finished her confinement.

386
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,060
Is it realistic to expect her

387
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,140
to pack up everything?

388
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,020
I admit I was impulsive today.

389
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,620
Not just today.

390
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,900
Every time you see Fang Xiewen,
you get impulsive,

391
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,700
as if you're arch-enemies.

392
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,300
I'm telling you.

393
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
I'll never forgive him

394
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,980
for not agreeing to the epidural

395
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,220
during childbirth.

396
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,540
But he's still Rose's husband.

397
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,700
Provoking him does no good to Rose.

398
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,700
For Rose's sake,

399
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,260
show him some respect, okay?

400
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,620
When I came in,

401
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,860
I think I heard Fang's mother say

402
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,300
she doesn't want to stay in Shanghai.

403
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
What else did she say?

404
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,980
She seemed quite dissatisfied

405
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,900
with your family.

406
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,780
So, you!

407
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,740
At this critical moment,

408
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,940
don't escalate the conflict, okay?

409
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,740
Why didn't you stop me this afternoon?

410
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,140
You're like a stubborn donkey,

411
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,220
ready to kick anyone.

412
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,300
Could I have stopped you?

413
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,780
But I know

414
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,340
you're a reasonable donkey.

415
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,100
Once you think things through,

416
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,460
you'll listen to advice.

417
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,860
Do you think I can turn my tough exterior

418
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,660
into some donkey-hide gelatin

419
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
to nourish you?

420
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,220
Ow!

421
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,060
Let me tell you.

422
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,740
These are wool knee pads.

423
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,660
Rose asked me to buy them for your parents.

424
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,100
Make sure you tell them

425
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,540
they are from Rose and Fang Xiewen.

426
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,740
From Fang Xiewen?

427
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,900
Fine.

428
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,020
These two bags of Shanghai specialties

429
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,980
are for your parents from you.

430
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,820
So thoughtful.

431
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,860
How about these?

432
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,380
I bought it for your parents.

433
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,220
I plan to give it to them in person.

434
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,460
Wait.

435
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,860
Didn't you disagree with seeing my parents?

436
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,540
Can't avoid them forever.

437
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Didn't you say that?

438
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,060
This is serious.

439
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,100
Do you mean...

440
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,940
Exactly.

441
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,300
Waiting has been tough.

442
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,140
No, no.

443
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,380
It's been wonderful.

444
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,460
But it's your fault.

445
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
I was waiting for you to invite me again.

446
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,980
Who knew you'd stop after the first time?

447
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm not a mind-reader.

448
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,780
How would I know your plans?

449
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,020
Thank you.

450
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,140
I love you.

451
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,340
Your brother is still worried.

452
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,300
He asked me to check

453
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,980
if you need it.

454
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,220
He forgot

455
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,460
when we were kids,

456
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,180
four of us squeezed into a tiny room

457
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,060
in a dormitory,

458
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,000
with a shared bathroom and kitchen,

459
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,860
yet we were happy.

460
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,860
The baby is so young,

461
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,180
she doesn't care about big or small houses.

462
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,620
As long as she's fed,

463
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,980
cared for,

464
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,660
and has some company,

465
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,460
she's happy.

466
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,980
What about you?

467
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,700
I always say live within your means.

468
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,100
When Taichu is older, I'll go back to work.

469
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,460
Sure.

470
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,980
Still the Huang Yimei I used to know.

471
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,260
No one calls me by my name anymore.

472
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,660
Everyone calls me Taichu's mom.

473
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,340
I love her.

474
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,660
And I feel the joy of being a mother.

475
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,060
But I still want to be myself.

476
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,780
I don't want the name Huang Yimei

477
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,260
to be replaced by Taichu's mom.

478
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,940
Am I being selfish?

479
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
You're brave.

480
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,180
You've chosen a path

481
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,500
that requires double the effort.

482
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,300
(Tsinghua South Road)

483
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,700
Su, don't be formal.

484
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,020
Make yourself at home.

485
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,860
Don't just stand. Grab a seat.

486
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,700
I'll go get the soup.

487
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,140
Mrs. Huang, let me help you.

488
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,980
No need.

489
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,380
- I'll do it, don't worry.
- Come on, come on.

490
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,500
Sit, sit.

491
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,340
Su.

492
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
Have a seat.

493
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,660
I've wanted Zhenhua to bring you over.

494
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,220
My wife is a fantastic cook.

495
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,500
You should come more often.

496
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,100
Thank you, Uncle. I will.

497
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,300
- Here comes the soup.
- Try this.

498
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,220
The pork trotters
are one of my mom's specialties.

499
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,100
Let's wait for your mom.

500
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,780
- Come, come.
- Come, come.

501
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,540
Let me serve Su first.

502
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,380
Yes, of course.

503
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,060
Right, right.

504
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,460
Here.

505
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,660
Let me serve our physics professor next.

506
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,340
My wonderful mom.

507
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,260
Give it to your dad first.

508
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
Taking care of the patient, huh?

509
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,380
Taking care of the patient.

510
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
Here.

511
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,260
This bowl is for Mom.

512
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,340
Enough, enough.

513
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,820
Mom, thank you.

514
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,340
Thank you.

515
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,660
- That's enough.
- Come, come, quickly.

516
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,980
- Come, come.
- Let's eat first.

517
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,820
Taste it.

518
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,980
- Sure.
- Let's eat.

519
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,060
These shrimp are delicious too.

520
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,940
Yes, the shrimp.

521
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,100
Try it.

522
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,900
- Delicious?
- Delicious, right?

523
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,060
It's really good.

524
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,500
Of course, my mom's cooking.

525
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,380
I'll try it too.

526
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,300
You try it too.

527
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,660
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's great.

528
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,900
You look like you just survived a disaster.

529
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Meeting the parents

530
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,740
wasn't as scary as I thought.

531
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,140
Did you think they'd be monsters

532
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,220
or sanctimonious hypocrites?

533
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,460
No.

534
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,660
I've always envied Huang Yimei.

536
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,540
Today, I feel rooted.

537
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,620
From now on, treat them like your own parents.

538
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,780
Act spoiled if you want.

539
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,820
Argue if you want.

540
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,620
What's wrong?

541
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,940
Thank your parents

542
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,500
for raising you and Yimei
into such warm people.

543
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
So warm.

544
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,620
I'm a bit jealous.

545
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,100
Not just warm, right?

546
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,100
Aren't we

547
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,500
also excellent?

548
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,100
Take me home.

549
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,300

Yes.

Why are you getting so many certifications?

561
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,100
It's good to have multiple skills.

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,620
A child in their early years

564
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,980
needs a mother's company the most.

565
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,980
These two things aren't mutually exclusive.

566
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,580
I just spend a few hours a day studying.

567
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,020
I'll fall behind society if I stop learning.

568
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,220
By the way,

569
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,260
I forgot

570
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,660
to tell you something.

571
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,700
My mom is going back to her hometown.

572
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
She's not feeling well.

573
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,900
I booked her a train ticket for next week.

574
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
Is she okay?

575
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,780
If there's any issue,

576
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,420
hospitals in Shanghai are better.

577
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,380
Does she need a check-up?

578
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,940
It's nothing serious.

579
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,860
I think

580
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,900
she's just tired.

581
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
A few days of rest at home should be fine.

582
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,380
Then I'll hire a housekeeper

583
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,300
to help with cooking and such.

584
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,220
No need. I can manage.

585
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,700
Trust me. I can take care of the house.

586
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,300
Alright.

587
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,260
I'll go out tomorrow

588
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,700
and buy some specialties for your mom

589
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,540
to take back.

590
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
Great.

591
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,900
After staying in that small, run-down place

592
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,340
with you for so long,

593
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,420
now that the new house is ready,

594
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,380
you want to kick me out.

595
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,900
I've worked hard to serve the three of you.

596
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,540
Now you don't need me anymore,

597
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,140
so you want to get rid of me.

598
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,780
Mom,

599
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,140
the new house has
a south-facing bedroom for you.

600
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,300
We'll bring you back eventually.

601
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,580
Then why can't I live there now?

602
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,020
You

603
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,380
are too diligent.

604
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,460
Only after you leave

605
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,780
will she understand

606
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,180
that her focus

607
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,980
should be on the family.

608
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,060
Why didn't you say so earlier?

609
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,500
You go home and rest well.

610
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,740
When we have a second child,

611
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,060
I'll bring you back.

612
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,260
By the way,

613
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,940
be careful with your money.

614
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,940
Don't tell her everything.

615
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,100
Be mindful.

616
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,220
Do you get it, silly son?

617
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,900
I know.

618
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,540
What did you get me?

619
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,220
- Specialties.
- Specialties?

620
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,300
All food?

621
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,700
Didn't you put some money in here?

622
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,100
I did.

623
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,020
Where?

624
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,980
Well.

625
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,580
In the bank.

626
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,780
You rascal.

627
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

628
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm Huang Zhenhua,

629
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,260
I have an appointment with Tony

630
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,900
from your Development Department at 2 pm.

631
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,260
He's in a meeting.

632
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,100
Please wait a moment.

633
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,180
You can sit over there.

634
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,580
Thank you.

635
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,540
Huang Zhenhua?

636
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,580
That's me.

637
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
Mr. Tony's ready?

638
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,820
Don't you recognize me?

639
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,700
Guan Zhizhi?

640
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,100
Long time no see.

641
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,260
Long time no see, Guan Zhizhi.

642
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,780
What are you doing here?

643
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,100
This is my company.

644
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,620
Your company?

645
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,540
Isn't this Harrison Group?

646
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,740
Harrison is my husband.

647
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,180
I got married.

648
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,180
Congratulations, congratulations.

649
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,060
What brings you here?

650
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,620
I have a project to discuss

651
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,460
with Tony

652
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
from your Development Department.

653
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,300
What project? Let me see.

654
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,540
A hotel design.

655
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,980
Let's talk inside.

656
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,060
Here.

657
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,780
Get a cup of coffee.

658
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,780
Yes, Ms. Guan.

659
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,500
- Hello, Ms. Guan.
- Hello, Ms. Guan.

660
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,740
Thank you.

661
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,580
Sit down.

662
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,980
Mrs. Harrison,

663
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,740
I never expected this.

664
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,940
You've changed so much.

665
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,300
Really?

666
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,980
So, have I changed for the better or the worse?

667
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,300
Of course, you've only gotten better.

668
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
You haven't changed much yourself.

669
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,500
I recognized you at first glance.

670
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm quite casual.

671
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,940
Harrison Group

672
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,180
was co-founded by me and my husband.

673
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm the legal representative.

674
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,260
Plus, I handle finances and such.

675
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,660
When did you leave your previous job?

676
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,820
About a year after I broke up with Zhou Shihui.

677
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,940
Then I joined a real estate company,

678
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,540
where I met Harrison.

679
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,940
He taught me a lot.

680
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,700
Of course, I'm also smart, you know.

681
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,660
I learn fast, so...

682
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,260
This

683
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,580
is our proposal.

684
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,780
- You...
- It's okay. Just leave it there.

685
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,700
Give it to Tony after his meeting.

686
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,900
How about you?

687
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,140
I also resigned.

688
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,420
Now I'm working on my own.

689
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,700
You left the Architectural Institute?

690
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
There's something

691
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,220
I can't hide from you.

692
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,500
Well,

693
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,860
Zhou Shihui

694
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,780
is my partner now.

695
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,620
With your past,

696
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
if you don't want to work with me,

697
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,420
I completely understand.

698
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,460
It's the modern age.

699
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,700
That's water under the bridge.

700
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,100
Don't worry. I won't let this

701
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,180
affect our collaboration.

702
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,140
If your qualifications are okay,

703
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,100
and the price is right,

704
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,100
why wouldn't I work with an old friend?

705
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,940
Really?

706
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,420
That's great, really great.

707
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,260
Thank you, thank you.

708
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,060
Ms. Guan, your vision is exceptional.

709
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,020
Thank you, thank you.

710
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,500
You can call me Guan Zhizhi.

711
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,540
Actually, I'm quite grateful to you.

712
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,140
Zhou Shihui and I are different.

713
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,300
I knew that long ago.

714
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,500
If we had forced it back then,

715
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,100
we would have divorced long ago.

716
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,380
I didn't realize

717
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,220
until after leaving him

718
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,180
that I could do so much.

719
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,940
Thank you for waking me up.

720
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,180
Right, and your sister.

721
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Rose, right?

722
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,300
I've always remembered her.

723
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,260
How is she now? Is she okay?

724
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,860
She's doing well.

725
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,380
She's in Shanghai now,

726
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,300
married and become a mother.

727
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,900
She has children too?

728
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
May I ask

729
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,460
what her husband does?

730
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,420
He must be great.

731
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,980
He's okay.

732
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
He started a small IT company.

733
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,620
That's good. An IT company.

734
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,220
Send my regards to Rose.

735
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,380
If she's free,

736
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,060
we could have dinner and catch up.

737
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,340
Sure.

738
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,260
Mom!

739
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,300
Chase me!

740
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,100
Don't run here.

741
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,140
The kids are too playful.

742
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,700
- Wait for me.
- Go ahead.

743
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,220
Mom, chase me.

744
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,540
Come here, come here.

745
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,620
Come, come, come.

746
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,660
Come here.

747
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,220
Come and play here.

748
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,060
Come here, come here.

749
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,140
Mrs. Harrison.

750
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,020
You can't imagine.

751
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,460
She's completely transformed.

752
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,220
I hardly recognized her.

753
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,940
It's just like they say online.

754
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,540
A woman is better off marrying well.

755
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,620
She suddenly became Mrs. Harrison.

756
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,220
I had to beg her to give me a project.

757
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,300
But she has the ability herself.

758
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,060
She marries well because she does well herself.

759
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,940
And her husband isn't stupid either.

760
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,140
If she hadn't been outstanding,

761
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,260
why would he have noticed her?

762
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,460
And that's also thanks

763
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,620
to her husband's platform and resources.

764
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,060
With their family conditions so good,

765
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,500
why not stay at home to enjoy life?

766
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,900
Who said women

767
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,780
must stay at home to raise children?

768
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,100
Material life is just a basic need.

769
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,940
Some people pursue

770
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,580
a sense of spiritual abundance.

771
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,140
Should I tell Zhou about this?

772
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,220
There's no need to deliberately mention it,

773
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
but no need to hide it either.

774
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,820
As long as Guan Zhizhi doesn't hold a grudge,

775
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,780
you can just handle business as usual.

776
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,500
When I was talking to Guan Zhizhi today

777
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,660
about the hotel project,

778
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,380
she talked freely

779
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,340
and professionally.

780
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,020
If it were exactly like you said,

781
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,260
her husband

782
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,940
might actually depend on her.

783
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,660
Guan Zhizhi has become Mrs. Harrison.

784
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,860
People don't know how excellent they are

785
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,300
until they push themselves.

786
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,740
I'm pushing you every day.

787
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,340
Does that work?

788
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,420
You haven't slimmed down.

789
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,580
Look at your dumbbells. They're rusty.

790
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,140
The dumbbells are almost rusty,

791
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,580
but I've been better than before, right?

792
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,380
You're just a calculator bead.

793
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,220
You only move unless I push you.

794
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,380
Oh, my. The dish is burned.

795
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,860
Right. Drive in.

796
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,100
Over here.

797
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,540
Do you see me?

00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,420

- Slow down.

in that dress.

849
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,900
Why not change into pants?

850
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,340
It's better to dress formally
for the interview.

851
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,060
Who says pants aren't formal?

852
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,140
I only have jeans.

853
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,460
It's not that high of a position.

854
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,300
It's not necessary.

855
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,580
- I'm going to be late.
- Rose.

856
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
Change into pants.

857
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,180
It won't take long.

858
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,980
Is there something wrong with my dress?

859
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,540
Do you want to do this in front of the child?

860
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,100
Your resume is quite interesting.

861
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,940
You majored in art history in college,

862
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,180
and studied psychology in graduate school.

863
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,420
You worked after your graduation,

864
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,700
and you used to be a curator.

865
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,940
Could you explain why

866
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,060
there's such a big leap in between?

867
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,820
In college, it was actually driven by interest.

868
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,900
After graduation, I did related work.

869
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,500
During a charity art exhibition,

870
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,580
I got involved with autistic children,

871
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,300
which sparked my interest in psychology.

872
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,180
So I pursued relevant studies.

873
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,860
After graduation as a graduate student,

874
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,700
you worked at a publishing house, right?

875
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,660
Yes, because at that time I hadn't figured out

876
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,620
how to apply

877
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,980
my academic knowledge,

878
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,180
so I went

879
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,740
to the publishing house

880
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,980
at the recommendation of my mentor

881
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,740
and worked as an editor for psychology books.

882
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,300
You only worked for a little over a year.

883
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,420
Then you had three years off.

884
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,380
What did you do during that time?

885
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,780
I had a child.

886
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,780
You're applying for an art teacher position.

887
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
Your educational background is good,

888
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,100
but you lack

889
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,620
relevant experience, right?

890
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,020
These.

891
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,380
These are some certifications
I've obtained in the past years.

892
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,540
I've actually been thinking

893
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,740
about how to apply what I've learned before

894
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,620
and my work experience

895
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,380
to practical scenarios.

896
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,540
Now I have an idea.

897
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,760
I want to provide psychological counseling

898
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,620
through painting for students.

899
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,780
Could you elaborate on this?

900
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,660
What exactly is it?

901
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,900
It's similar to Western art therapy courses,

902
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,420
but we target

903
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,020

904
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,140
