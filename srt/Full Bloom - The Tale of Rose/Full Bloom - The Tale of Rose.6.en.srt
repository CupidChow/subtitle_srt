3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,790
Every time we argued,

4
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,370
you always nitpicked about words

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,610
and made long-winded speeches.

6
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,230
In fact,

7
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,720
you were just trying to cover up

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,540
(Contacts Huang Yimei)
your guilt and incompetence.

9
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,020
Once I saw through that,

10
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,380
I lost even the desire
to argue with you.

11
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,540
Does that count as arguing?

12
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,180
We're well-educated.

13
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,780
We should discuss things
calmly and rationally.

14
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,940
Identify problems, analyze problems,
and solve problems.

15
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,140
Using language to resolve conflicts,
isn't that right?

16
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,060
At least I tried.

17
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,460
I have a clear conscience.

18
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,220
But do you have a clear conscience

19
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,340
about the money?

20
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,740
Regarding money, I am ashamed.

21
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,540
But maintaining a family
isn't just about money.

22
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,500
There's also affection.

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,100
When you left without a word,

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,980
over thousands of miles,

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,220
you enjoyed your life,

26
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,900
while I wallowed in self-pity.

27
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,380
There's no debt between us.

28
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,380
I left without a word,

29
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,980
but I was alone in France,

30
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,220
without even knowing the language,

31
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,700
unable to rent a house.

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,380
I worked with the locals

33
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,260
but had to put in

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,820
ten times the effort they did.

35
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,900
Your clairvoyance

36
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,460
and clairaudience

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,060
couldn't see or hear all that.

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,740
All you could see

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,500
was me dating those men.

40
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,580
Beauty fades quickly.

41

Fleeting youth.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,700
It's nice to be with someone
when you're alone outside.

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,220
Your mother and I

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,300
have agreed for a long time.

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,660
Our marriage is only in name.

46
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,980
It's not like she cheated on me.

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,820
Zhuang Taiwen,

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,780
before I went abroad,

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,380
I already asked you for a divorce.

50
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,260
It was you who procrastinated.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,940
The headquarters was urging me.
I couldn't wait.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,140
I won't waste my life because of you.

53
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,300
You didn't waste it.

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
Haven't you been changing boyfriends?

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,660
One after another.

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,940
You keep getting younger ones.

57
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,180
You even found one as young as your son.

58
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,740
How can you do that?

59
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,740
- None of your business.
- I'm curious.

60
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,540
When you go out with such a boyfriend,

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,700
do people wonder

62
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,740
if he's your son or your husband?

63
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,380
Shut up.

64
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,260
Not everyone is like you,

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,780
worshiping money.

66
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,180
I have dreams.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,820
I've been writing
continuously for ten years.

68
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,500
I have a new work now.

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm telling you.

70
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,620
This woman seems to have a lover.

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,380
She's getting divorced from her husband.

72
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,660
Is that handsome guy
her lover or her son?

73
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,860
No way, that's too big a difference.

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,940
He's really handsome.

75
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,820

191
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,060
I have to go. It's too late.

192
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,180
Don't go.

193
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,260
Don't go.

194
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,580
You're back.

195
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,900
Where were you so late?

196
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,780
Are you a zombie?

197
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,820
Look at the time.

198
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,020
Look at the time.

199
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,860
What time is it?

200
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,540
I should thank you.

201
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,380
Thank me for what?

202
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,380
Thank...

203
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,820
Thank you for waiting so late for me.

204
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,660
The flight was at 6:30 pm.

205
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,500
Even with traffic,
you should've been home by 9.

206
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,780
Now it's the middle of the night.

207
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,980
I called you, but you didn't answer.

208
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,380
I had to lie to our parents.

209
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,460
I was entertaining the boss.

210
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,980
What?

211
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,940
Why do you smell like men's cologne?

212
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,380
Were you with that guy

213
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,820
in the blue shirt?

214
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,700
I was having dinner with my boss.

215
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,540
Nonsense.

216
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,500
Had dinner right
after your business trip?

217
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,300
I came back just for this dinner.

218
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,220
The flight was delayed.

219
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,240
I dragged my suitcase

220
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,460
and didn't even have time to drop it off.

221
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,380
Is it easy for me?

222
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,700
Was it just you two at the dinner?

223
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Yes.

224
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,100
Just having dinner
with an important client.

225
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,180
I couldn't answer the phone.

226
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,660
What kind of client? Male or female?

227
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,700
Who's texting you so late?

228
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,140
Come on, let me see.

229
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,620
It's probably the boss
asking if I got home.

230
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,980
Then show me.

231
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,580
Show you what?

232
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,980
- I'm worried.
- Go back, go back.

233
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,820
Come on.

234
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,640
Show me.

235
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,900
- If you have nothing to hide,
- Good night.

236
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,510
- why are you afraid to show me?
- Good night, good night.

237
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,180
Let me see.

238
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,020
Who texted you?

239
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,300
(From Zhuang Guodong: I miss you.)

240
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,940

- Come on.
- I...

247
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,300
Come back.

248
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,260
One.

249
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,580
- Sit down and eat slowly.
- Take more.

250
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,420
Take more.

251
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,380
Dad!

252
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,020
- Bag.
- Rosie.

253
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,220
You forgot your bag.

254
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,060
Here.

255
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,340
Take it.

256
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,180
Alright, I'm leaving.

257
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,780
- Slowly.
- Rosie.

258
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,900
Get in the car. I'll take you.

259
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
That's nice of you.

260
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,300
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

261
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,180
There's no time.

262
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,660
Why did you suddenly decide
to take me today?

263
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,140
Running errands, huh?

264
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,740
- Morning.
- Good morning.

265
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,460
Which room is your boss in?

266
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,460
How can I help you?

267
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,860
Zhenhua, what are you doing?
I'm at work.

268
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,700
I'm with her.

269
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,800
I want to see your boss.

270
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,680
- Take me to him.
- No.

271
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,660
What are you doing?

272
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
- Stop making a scene, okay?
- I'm not.

273
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,140
I just want to ask him a few questions.

274
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,380
Don't go crazy, okay?

275
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,220
What did I do to you?

276
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,220
Hurry, hurry, take me there.

277
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,700
Why...

278
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,900
Boss.

279
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,740
You are Huang Yimei's boss?

280
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,180
Yes.

281
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm Su Gengsheng. And you are?

282
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,780
I'm her brother,

283
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,020
Huang Zhenhua.

284
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,520
Is there a problem?

285
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,380
Last night,

286
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,060
did she go out with you
for a business dinner?

287
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,060
Any problem?

288
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,500
Is this how you treat your employees?

289
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,300
What kind of job
requires a recent graduate

290
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
to go from the plane
to dinner until midnight?

291
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Do you know what time she got home?

292
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,660
Nearly two in the morning.

293
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,820
Do you think that's appropriate?

294
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,140
Did I force you to go?

295
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,340
I went willingly.

296
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,140
Heard it?

297
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,340
But it shouldn't go until midnight.

298
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,980
Who takes responsibility
if anything happens?

299
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,210
The company's rules and regulations

300
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,940
are clearly stated
in the employee handbook.

301
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
Work overtime voluntarily.

302
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,420
Full payment.

303
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,580
Reimbursement for travel expenses
with receipts.

304
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
If employees have issues,

305
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,900
they can talk to the leader
or report to HR.

306
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,900
Did you pay her for overtime?

307
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,740
Handle it yourself.

308
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,300
You're so skinny.

309
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,460
You're not as tough as my sister.

310
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,060
Don't you have any safety awareness?

311
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,840
Has your company passed

312
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,230
the occupational health and safety
management system certification?

313
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Our company ensures

314
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,940
employees' occupational health and safety

315
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,780
but doesn't care

316
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,900
about their families' mental health.

317
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,980
Look at you, a grown man

318
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,460
can't even tie your tie properly,

319
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,300
yet you have the nerve to lecture others.

320
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,100
What's wrong with my mental health?

321
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,420
What's wrong
with worrying about my sister?

322
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,780
Is there a problem with that?

323
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,420
Is this how you run a company?

324
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,340
Su, Su.

325
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,620
Sorry about that.

326
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,020
His words aren't worth
getting angry over.

327
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,020
I'm apologizing for myself.

328
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,100
I shouldn't have used you as a shield.

329
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,180
You didn't use me as a shield.

330
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,980
You used your job as a shield.

331
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,580
Next time you go on a date,

332
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,780
make sure your lies are more coherent.

333
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,100
Su.

334
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,300
You don't need to explain to me.

335
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,100
The office isn't a place for you
to have a paid romance.

336
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,220
Think

337
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,500
about what I said.

338
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,620
How can you be so cold-blooded?

339
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,100
Who are you to judge me?

340
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,380
I'm reminding you not
to bring your personal feelings

341
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,420
into the office.

342
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,500
Is that a problem?

343
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,820
I won't bring personal feelings
into the office,

344
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,180
but you also shouldn't take out

345
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
your personal emotions on me.

346
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,220
You shouldn't

347
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,540
trust human emotions too much.

348
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,340
You don't understand now.

349
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,460
Cry twice and you'll get it.

350
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,340
- Morning.
- Morning.

351
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,380
Huang, I have something to tell you.

352
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,300
Tell me later.

353
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,980
(Best wishes, Huang Yimei)

354
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,960
(We are a bit sad to hear
you're moving to another project.)

355
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,780
(We were surprised
to hear you're leaving the team.)

356
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,860
You have a new email.

357
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,820
(Wishing you all the best, Shi Jingyun)

358
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,660
(Eric: Good luck.)

359
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,740
(From Zhuang Guodong:
How about dinner after work?)

360
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,900
(To Zhuang Guodong: You're the boss.)

361
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,820
Fish,

362
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
pork,

363
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,700
or macaroni.

364
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,900
Which one do you want?

365
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,020
Why are you laughing?

366
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,180
You choose.

367
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,700
Then let's have...

368
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,740
- This project
- Fish.

369
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,260
might have a lot of potential.

370
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,460
Yes, we need to work together more

371
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,660
and cooperate on more projects.

372
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,500
Yes.

373
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,980
You go in first.

374
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,420
- Okay.
- You go first.

375
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,340
Continue. I'll be back.

376
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,500
Why are you here for dinner?

377
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,740
Who is that girl?

378
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,740
Nobody.

379
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,220
Just having dinner with a colleague.

380
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,060
Why are you here?

381
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,740
Who is it?

382
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,340
My mom.

383
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,380
Your mom?

384
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,500
She looks so young.

385
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,220
Should I go say hi to her?

386
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,140
No need.

387
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,260
I told her you were my colleague.

388
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,420
You go ahead and order.

389
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,340
Your colleague?

390
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,460
No.

391
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,900
Your friend?

392
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Not really.

393
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,940
Your mistress then?

394
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,300
Definitely not.

395
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,420
Rosie.

396
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,900
Rosie.

397
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,620
Do you think we should...

398
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,460
I'm back.

399
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,860
Good.

400
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
You've made so much.

401
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Rosie isn't home.

402
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,100
Can the three of us eat all this?

403
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,340
It's a bit much.

404
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,020
How about

405
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,300
inviting Xiaohe over for dinner?

406
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,620
You're doing it on purpose.

407
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,660
I...

408
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,780
How could I be doing it on purpose?

409
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,060
You've been together for a while.

410
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,700
It's time to invite her over
to our place.

411
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
It's just a step away.

412
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,180
Didn't you do that when we were young

413
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,620
and having play dates?

414
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,700
Today I met Professor Liang.

415
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,420
He said you went to the lab

416
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,340
to see Bai Xiaohe, right?

417
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,940
Professor Liang introduced you
to such a nice girl.

418
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,500
We should thank him properly.

419
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,140
Huang,

420
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,940
how about buying a box of ginseng?

421
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,780
Ginseng?

422
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,220
Do you think it's appropriate?

423
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,340
I don't think so.

424
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,260
This gift seems
more like a broker's fee.

425
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,220
Mom,

426
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,660
if...

427
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,900
If things don't work out

428
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,380
between me and Xiaohe,

429
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,620
will you ask for the gift back?

430
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,300
That's up to me. Bring her home.

431
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,300
Come on.

432
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,700
Why do you assume she loves dumplings

433
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,740
and hates glutinous rice balls?

434
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,020
She's a Southern girl.

435
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,500
Professor Liang didn't mention

436
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,700
that to me.

437
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,980
Didn't see me?

438
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,820
Did your boss scold you?

439
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,060
I was too impulsive this morning.

441
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,740
It's not about you.

442
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
Then what's wrong with you?

443
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,540
I got dumped.

444
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,700
Dumped?

445
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,460
When did you start dating?

446
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,140
With the guy in the blue shirt?

447
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,660
He rejected you?

448
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,700
Dare he?

449
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,660
Do you want me
to give you another trick?

450
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,180
Mind your own business.

451
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,500
What's wrong with you?

452
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,260
What is this?

453
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,100
Dad and Mom asked me
to give dumplings to Bai Xiaohe.

454
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,860
Do it.

455
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,540
The cat's out of the bag.

456
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,740
A little wind blew in,

457
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
and it's all cold now.

458
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,180
She changed her mind?

459
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,700
In her eyes,

460
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,340
I'm just a decent blind date option.

461
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,420
If it were in the old days,

462
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,340
she'd have put up with it.

463
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,420
She tried,

464
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,900
but in her heart,

465
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,020
I'm still not the one.

466
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,660
Given all this,

467
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,520
they still want me
to take the dumplings over.

468
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,300
If I do it,

469
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,140
it's quite a burden on her.

470
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,860
But if I don't,

471
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,140
how do I explain to Mom and Dad?

472
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,460
You don't want to tell them

473
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,500
because you can't bear
to break up with her, right?

474
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,700
No.

475
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,180
No.

476
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,820
(Zhuang Guodong calling)

477
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,540
Why aren't you answering?

478
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,140
It's him, right?

479
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
You can ask him.

480
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,940
Let me ask him for you. Come.

481
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,140
Don't meddle.

482
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,460
This is a phone!

483
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,100
Did he take advantage of you?

484
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Who says only men
can take advantage of women?

485
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,620
I took advantage of him,

486
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,260
and I haven't had enough yet.

487
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,340
Come on.

488
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,020
This...

489
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,980
This...

490
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,660
This cost thousands.

491
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,700
Sorry,

492
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,940
the user you dialed is not in service.

493
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,660
(To Huang Yimei: Rosie, don't be angry.
Pick up the phone.)

494
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,500
Hello,

495
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,940
the number you dialed is powered off.

496
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,820
Sorry.

497
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,700
(To Huang Yimei: I said the wrong thing.)

498
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,820
(Can you give me a chance to apologize?)

499
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Who do you think it is?

500
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,500
Why are you here?

501
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,020
I'm going back to Paris tomorrow,

502
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,060
so I came to say goodbye.

503
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,780
Bon voyage.

504
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,660
Can you get me some water?

505
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,940
This cup is broken.

506
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,860
Why don't you throw it away?

507
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,700
Don't touch it.

508
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,100
Give it to me.

509
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,340
You look so absent-minded.

510
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,780
Is it because of the girl I saw today?

511
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,580
The one with the hawk

512
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,980
shouldn't let the hawk peck their eyes.

513
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,700
You say this every time I date someone.

514
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,740
What if this time it's real?

515
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,180
You change girlfriends faster

516
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,420
than my company changes models.

517
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,060
I can't even remember those girls' names.

518
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,540
What's different about this one?

519
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,900
I know there is something different.

520
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,460
You won't understand even if I tell you.

521
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,220
Don't bother asking.

522
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,340
I don't want to ask.

523
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,460
But

524
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,860
I'll remind you.

525
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,860
Don't be like your dad.

526
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,580
If you hated my dad,

527
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,060
why did you marry him?

528
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Because you're like me.

529
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,620
I don't want to see you

530
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,140
walk the same path I did.

531
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,020
At your age,

532
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,220
you should focus on work,

533
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,500
instead of love affairs.

534
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,460
Otherwise, you'll end up like your dad,

535
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,380
with nothing accomplished.

536
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,060
- Morning.
- Morning.

537
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,900
Morning.

538
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,780
Morning.

539
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,700
Yimei,

540
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,780
the flowers came again.

541
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,820
You keep them.

542
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,420
Okay, thanks, Yimei.

543
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,820
I'll get you a cup of coffee later.

544
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

545
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,700
Hello.

546
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,020
Don't like the flowers from me?

547
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,460
Why is your phone off?

548
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,660
It's not off.

549
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,140
I changed the number.

550
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,100
Tell me the new number.

551
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,460
Why should I?

552
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,900
Tell me.

553
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,020
Move.

554
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,180
Tell me.

555
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,020
That's all the strength you have?

556
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Is dinner ready?

557
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,220
Don't change your shoes first.

558
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
Your uncle brought some mangoes
from our hometown.

559
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,940
Give some to Bai Xiaohe.

560
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,580
Let's keep them for ourselves.

561
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,500
There's plenty at home. Come on.

562
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,940
The other day, I took dumplings over,

563
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,100
and now these mangoes.

564
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,140
Trying to get her to visit?

565
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,460
Stop talking if you know.

566
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,380
Go.

567
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,820
(School of Chemistry)

568
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,820
Oh, my.

569
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,140
I'm sorry

570
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,820
for keeping you waiting.

571
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,300
I just want to say one thing

572
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,140
and then I'll leave.

573
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,180
My parents don't know about us.

574
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,740
They insisted I bring you these mangoes.

575
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,540
They gave you dumplings the other day,

576
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,460
and I ate them for you

577
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,060
However, there are
too many mangoes this time.

578
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,780
Eating them all will make me explode.

579
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
I've said my piece. I'm leaving.

580
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,700
Please thank your parents for me.

581
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,260
I actually quite like mangoes.

582
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,100
Really?

583
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,340
After knowing you for so long,

584
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,380
this is the first time
I've seen you smile so happily.

585
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
After our last conversation,

586
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,460
I felt much lighter.

587
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,860
I shouldn't have
started a relationship with you

588
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,900
without letting go of my ex.

589
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,980
That was unfair to you.

590
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,180
How would you know without trying?

591
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,300
You didn't do it intentionally.

592
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,500
To be honest,

593
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,940
I thought you might blame me,

594
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,620
thinking I was using you
as a replacement,

595
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,060
so I didn't contact you.

596
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,900
When you called me about the mangoes,

597
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,300
I was actually quite happy.

598
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,580
Funny. I was too.

599
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,340
Afraid you'd think I'm pestering you.

600
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,380
How could I think that?

601
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,860
You're actually very kind.

602
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,500
My parents will definitely like you.

603
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,300
My parents really like you.

604
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,700
Since Professor Liang introduced us,

605
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,580
she's been sure about you

606
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,660
and never mentioned anyone else.

607
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,020
Is your family also pushing for marriage?

608
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,980
Not pushing.

609
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,740
My mom is doing it for fun,

610
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,820
like trading stocks.

611
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,020
She wants to know
whether I'm on the rise or fall.

612
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,660
If human trafficking wasn't illegal,

613
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,140
she'd have put me on eBay long ago.

614
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,580
Your mom even knows about eBay?

615
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,020
Your family is really interesting.

616
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,180
They still don't know about us.

617
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
I want peace for some months.

618
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,700
Actually, I haven't
told my parents either.

619
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,460
If I did,

620
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,700
they'd introduce someone else to me.

621
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,140
So, what if we

622
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,980
just keep quiet

623
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,380
and pretend for now?

624
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,420
Is that okay?

625
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,420
Why wouldn't it be?

626
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,940
Acting doesn't cost anything.

627
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,260
Thank you.

628
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,980
Are you still here because of me?

629
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,740
I'm working overtime, not because of you.

630
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,260
Isn't your boyfriend with you outside?

631
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,460
He's not worthy.

632
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,660
Are you staying late to prove to me

633
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,900
that emotions won't affect work?

634
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
With so much work,

635
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,260
how can I finish without overtime?

636
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,620
What's this?

637
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,180
Irish coffee.

638
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,380
Where did you get the whiskey?

639
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,420
Tina's liquor?

640
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
You're bold enough

641
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,260
to drink the boss's alcohol.

642
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,540
Isn't it to drown my sorrows?

643
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,740
Of course, I have to use
someone else's liquor.

644
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,180
Don't stay out too late.

645
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,100
Bye-bye.

646
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,780
What are you doing?

647
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,560
Still being stubborn with me?

648
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,620
Did you drink?

649
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,620
Mind your own business.
