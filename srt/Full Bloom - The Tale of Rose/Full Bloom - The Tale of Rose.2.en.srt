Leave now. Don't...

5
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,010
- What are you doing?
- You homewrecker.

See if I'll beat you to death.

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Spreading rumors, slander,
and hitting people are all crimes.

If you want to hit me, go ahead.

there's a cafe across the street.

- My treat.
- Don't go.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,370
- Why would you go?
- Don't interfere.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,650
Didn't you just fire me?

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,010

Only my family can call me that.

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,090
Mr. Zhou,

191
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,530
do you like me

192
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,570
because I'm young and pretty?

193
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
No.

194
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,210
Not just because of that.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,930
You're smart, cheerful, and confident.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,360
You have an energy like...

197
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,840
Like sunlight.

198
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,410
Then do you have

199
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,410
anything special worth me liking?

200
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,370
Rosie...

201
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,170
Yimei,

202
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,450
my feelings for you are unique.

203
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,840
You're different from any other girl.

204
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,360
If I hadn't met you,

205
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,760
or felt this intense impact,

206
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,840
I might never have known

207
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,760
what it's like to love someone.

208
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,840
Seeing you

209
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,410
makes me happy.

210
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,810
That's your feeling,

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,080
not mine.

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,330
When Miss Guan accompanied you
to the cafeteria,

213
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,840
stayed up late with you
in the study room,

214
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,600
squeezed onto the bus with you,

215
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,240
and lived in the basement with you,

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
weren't you happy?

217
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,290
I have feelings

218
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,410
for Guan Zhizhi,

219
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,010
but

220
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,330
it feels more like

221
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,170
family.

222
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,290
When you first started dating,

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,930
did you feel she was like family too?

224
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
Mr. Zhou,

225
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
don't use me as an excuse

226
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,690
for your change of heart.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
No.

228
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,680
I...

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,840
There are many kinds of happiness
in the world.

230
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,410
If you want everything,

231
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,690
you'll end up like a bear

232
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,720
grabbing corn, right?

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm not your next corn.

234
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,840
Miss Guan is reasonable and beautiful.

235
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,210
It's your loss.

236
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,800
Rosie...

237
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,120
No, Yimei,

238
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,840
I didn't mean

239
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,210
to drag you into this.

240
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,170
I don't know what Guan Zhizhi told you,

241
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,010
but don't worry.

242
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,570
I'll handle it.

243
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,690
She won't bother you again.

244
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,480
You don't need to worry.

245
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
Zhou Shihui, listen carefully.

246
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,410
I reject you
not because I have concerns,

247
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,000
or because I pity Guan Zhizhi,

248
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,290
but because I don't like you.

249
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,650
Let's go.

250
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Don't mind him. Let's go eat.

251
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,840
Careful, careful.

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Okay, careful.

253
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,410
Okay.

254
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,370
Good.

255
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,810
Excuse me, sir.

256
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,000
Where are you moving these from?

257
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
Third floor.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,320
Be careful.

259
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,650
Yeah.

260
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,880
Be careful, sir.

261
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,120
I banged something against it.

262
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,010
Slowly.

263
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,810
This cabinet might get damaged here.

264
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
Slowly.

265
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,930
I'm moving my stuff out.

266
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,640
I scheduled it this afternoon,

267
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,760
so I didn't tell you.

268
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,290
Okay.

269
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,930
You paid for the renovations.

270
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,530
How much was it?

271
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,290
I should repay you.

272
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
No need.

273
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,010
Zhizhi.

274
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Zhou Shihui,

275
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
don't call me that anymore.

276
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,530
From today, we're even.

277
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,880
If we run into each other,

278
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,120
call me by my full name.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,800
Thank you.

280
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,600
If you ever face any difficulty...

281
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,240
There won't be any harder than this.

282
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,600
It's fine.

283
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,810
Wasting seven years
to see someone clearly

284
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,210
is better than wasting a lifetime.

285
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,810
- Done.
- Yes.

286
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,760
Thanks for your hard work, guys.

287
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll wait for you at the gate.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Got it.

289
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,020
(Married)

290
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,900
(Tsinghua Garden)

291
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,500
(Tsinghua South Road)

292
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,730
Why are you still at school
on a weekend?

293
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,570
Go home.

294
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,110
(Reception)
I'm not going home to face Mom's nagging.

295
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,250
How many days has it been? Stop that.

296
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,160
Go home, apologize to Mom, act cute,

297
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,970
and you'll still be her precious baby.

298
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,840
Why should I apologize?

299
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,330
She didn't trust me

300
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,490
and wrongly accused me.

301
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,840
Is it worth it?

302
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,920
Yes, it is.

303
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,490
I'm really upset,

304
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,490
and I'm not going home.

305
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,290
Since you want to break with the family,

306
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,530
- I'll tell them
- Give it back.

307
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,970
that you'll stop getting an allowance.

308
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,530
Huang Zhenhua,

309
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,680
don't kick me when I'm down.

310
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,930
I'm done talking to you.

311
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,360
Mom's done cooking.

312
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,880
She's making braised prawns today.

313
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,440
No one to compete with me.

314
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
The whole plate is mine.

315
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,680
Hello?

316
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,810
Rosie.

317
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,890
Dad.

318
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,970
I brought you some food.

319
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,410
It smells so good.

320
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,570
Open it.

321
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,610
Take a whiff.

322
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,760
How is it?

323
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,930
Dad,

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,530
did you come all the way across Beijing

325
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,120
to tempt me back home?

326
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,360
I came secretly.

327
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
Your mom doesn't know.

328
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,120
I didn't bring much.

329
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,440
I didn't want her to notice.

330
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,530
Tell Mom

331
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,490
I want braised pork next week.

332
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,400
Have you forgiven her?

333
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,250
With her cooking, how can I not?

334
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,120
That's right.

335
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,570
Your mom

336
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,400
has a sharp tongue.

337
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,730
She shows love

338
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
by cooking

339
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,570
and tempting you.

340
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,570
Dad,

341
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,010
how did someone as romantic as you

342
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,640
end up with Mom?

343
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,400
Someone said,

344
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,810
"The awakening of love
is the end of wisdom."

345
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,490
Then how did you last all these years?

346
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,730
Bacon said,

347
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,680
"Love and wisdom cannot coexist."

348
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,360
Dad, in your own words.

349
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,010
Your mom is just like that.

350
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,530
Like what?

351
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,650
Dad,

352
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,840
how's my painting?

353
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,410
Bold.

354
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,530
Bold?

355
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,050
What's that supposed to mean?

356
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,530
I asked if it was good.

357
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,810
If it was a Chinese painting,

358
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,330
I could say something about the spirit,

359
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,770
brushwork, and lines.

360
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,530
But this is abstract art.

361
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,880
I don't get it,

362
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
so I can't talk nonsense.

363
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,050
Since I can remember,

364
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,730
you've never criticized me.

365
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,730
No matter what I do,

366
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,600
you won't criticize me, right?

367
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,050
If you did something illegal,

368
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I don't need to criticize you.

369
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,440
The law would punish you.

370
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,730
If you did something immoral,

371
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,290
public opinion and conscience
would condemn you.

372
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,840
Some things, though,

373
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,330
have no right or wrong,

374
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,490
no standard.

375
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,680
Like love.

376
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,040
Love

377
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,770
is like your painting.

378
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,970
Even if I don't understand it,

379
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,090
I respect your expression.

380
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
You understand me best.

(Central Academy of Fine Arts)

382
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,850
Yimei, let's go.

383
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,880
Let's go to the job fair.

384
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,360
Why would I go?

385
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,250
Come with us.

386
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,490
It's right next to the zoo,
at the Beijing Exhibition Center.

387
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
Just come and see.

388
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,610
Alright, alright.

389
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,730
I've sent out so many resumes.

390
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,290
All without a response.

391
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,490
Is it this hard to find a job now?

392
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,030
Are you really planning
to go to grad school?

393
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,970
I don't want to, but my mom wants me to.

394
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,250
What do we do?

395
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
Graduation means unemployment.

397
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,570
- Two hours, thank you.
- Okay.

398
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,590
Mr. Li's secretary
will come for the package.

399
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,060
- Please hand it over.
- Got it.

400
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,360
Hello, I'm here for an interview.

401
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,330
May I have your name?

402
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,490
Huang Yimei. Y-I-M-E-I.

403
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,370
Please sign in.

404
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,010
Sorry, could you wipe this?

405
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,440
Where is the restroom?

406
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,360
It's over there.

407
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,040
Thank you.

408
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,280
Miss,

409
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,490
I'm here for an interview,

410
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,770
but I accidentally stained my clothes.

411
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,730
Could I borrow your scarf?

412
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,330
Leave me your contact info.

413
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,490
I'll dry clean it and return it.

414
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,810
Thank you, thank you.

415
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,850
Your phone number?

416
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,200
You can keep it.

417
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,040
Your turn.

418
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,370
Thank you.

419
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,760
Please have a seat.

420
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,330
Introduce yourself.

421
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,570
Hello, everyone. My name is Huang Yimei.

422
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
I see you studied at the CAFA,

423
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,200
but your resume lists an address

424
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,970
at Tsinghua University.

425
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,160
That's my home address.

426
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,160
My parents are teachers at Tsinghua.

427
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,330
A Tsinghua faculty child.

428
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,050
Why didn't you choose
to continue your studies?

429
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,840
Taking the graduate school exam
is a challenge for many.

430
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,440
But I'm quite good at studying.

431
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,650
So for me,

432
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,050
it's not a challenge.

433
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
It's my comfort zone.

434
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,090
I want to see

435
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,360
if I have other abilities

436
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,160
besides studying.

437
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,730
You haven't graduated yet, right?

438
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,490
When can you start working?

439
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,730
You have an art background.

440
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,880
From an aesthetic perspective,

441
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,680
how do you see
the application of art in life?

442
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,680
For example, why did you choose
to wear this scarf?

443
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,090
Is it because of the brand
or the design?

444
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,400
This scarf should be
from a niche Scandinavian brand.

445
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,810
I'm not very familiar with it.

446
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,400
The design uses bright geometric shapes,

447
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,290
likely inspired

448
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,810
by Malevich's style.

449
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,880
The designer's aesthetics are crucial

450
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,810
as they determine

451
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,880
a product's positioning and price.

452
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,920
The consumer's aesthetics
are also important,

453
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,010
because each person,

454
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,970
more or less,

455
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,530
shapes the character of society.

456
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,440
Good answer.

457
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,120
Alright, that's all for today.

458
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,530
Wait for our notification.

459
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,930
Thank you.

460
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,810
Thank you.

461
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
Are you really not going to grad school?

462
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,770
Will Mom agree?

463
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,360
You should give her a heads-up.

464
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,600
How do I do that without a job offer?

465
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,160
Even an anesthetic won't help.

466
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
The thing about Zhou Shihui
was just settled.

467
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,330
Mom's ready to reconcile with you,

468
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,890
and now you'll work after graduation?

469
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,440
First an earthquake, then a tsunami.

470
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Why does it always shake the house
when you come home?

471
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
You...

472
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,170
What's wrong?

473
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,970
I'll keep my mouth shut. Don't worry.

474
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,530
- Mom.
- Dad.

475
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,570
Mom.

476
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,010
We're back.

477
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,850
You're back.

478
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,400
Mom, Mom.

479
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,360
Mom, I missed you.

480
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,640
Why didn't you call me?

481
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,650
Still angry?

482
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,360
Don't be mad.

483
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,570
Your little cotton jacket
is back to keep you warm.

484
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
You're back for your braised pork.

485
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,970
Yes, Mom's braised pork.

486
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,530
Here, have a piece.

487
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,370
Here.

488
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,890
Alright, alright.

489
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,890
How is it?

490
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,290
Go wash your hands and let's eat.

491
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,720
Hurry.

492
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,330
Come on.

493
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,570
Hello?

494
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,160
Hello?

495
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Is this Huang Yimei's phone?

496
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,570
Huang Yimei?

497
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,290
How do you have my number?

498
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,600
She's my sister.
What do you want with her?

499
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,250
Could you please inform her?

500
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,250
She passed today's interview.

501
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,810
The second round

502
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,290
is on Wednesday at 2 pm.

503
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,610
Hello?

504
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,650
Hello.

505
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,330
I'm Huang Yimei's mother.

506
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,440
I'll let her know.

507
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,010
Whose phone is this?

508
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,570
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

509
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,360
Didn't I tell you?

510
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,640
Didn't you say you'd keep quiet?

511
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,090
Is this my fault?

512
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,200
You didn't tell me
you gave them my number.

513
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,920
So what?

514
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,600
Can't you think on your feet?

515
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,440
Here.

516
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,050
Smells good.

517
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,200
Mom,

518
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,110
I don't want to go to grad school.

519
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,570
You're studying art history.

520
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,250
What will you do
if you don't go to grad school?

521
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,410
Get a job.

522
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,890
Right, Dad?

523
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,810
Schools no longer guarantee jobs now.

524
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,400
Your scholarships

525
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,360
don't ensure you'll find a good job.

526
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,570
You haven't

527
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,840
entered society yet. You're too naive.

528
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,810
How will I find a job
without interviewing?

529
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,010
How will I enter society without a job?

530
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,050
I've mentored so many students.

531
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,530
I can tell at a glance

532
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,090
about their capabilities

533
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,440
and who will fit into what job.

534
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,400
With your current abilities,

535
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,330
you're not ready for society.

536
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,970
Mom, just because you
have many successful students,

537
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,640
it doesn't mean I will fail.

538
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,330
My colleagues
praised my learning abilities

539
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,120
during my internship.

540
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,610
Right, Zhenhua?

541
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,330
A degree is a stepping stone for jobs.

542
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,360
More degrees mean more opportunities.

543
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,570
You mean

544
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
going to grad school
is for getting a good job?

545
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,530
If I can find a good job now,

546
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,110
doesn't that mean
I don't need to go to grad school?

547
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
I had a great interview

548
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,050
with a wonderful company.

549
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,290
Everyone there

550
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,360
is very sophisticated.

551
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,810
You like the company,

552
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,770
but do they like you?

553
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,600
If it's as good as you say,

554
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,880
not everyone can get in.

555
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,200
Even if it's not a sure thing,

556
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,880
there's at least a good chance.

557
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,010
Then why did they notify me

558
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,160
of the second interview right away?

559
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,360
Fine, go to the second interview.

560
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,640
If you get in,

561
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,680
I'll stop mentioning grad school.

562
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,930
Deal?

563
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,640
If you can't get in, study at home.

564
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,650
Of course.

565
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,040
No more talk.

566
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,200
Let's eat.

567
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,760
Shrimp.

568
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,920
Mom, have some shrimp.

569
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,570
Eat it yourself.

570
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,840
I can finally eat it.

571
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,400
Our company's business scope

572
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
mainly involves
art exhibitions and trading,

573
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,090
and art event organization
and promotion.

574
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,880
Curation

575
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,570
is already mature abroad,

576
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,400
but it's still
an emerging industry at home.

577
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,770
Cyan is a pioneer in this industry.

578
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,640
Why do you want to apply

579
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,080
for the assistant to the general manager?

580
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,640
I have no work experience.

581
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,770
I don't know what each position does.

582
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,250
But I think the general manager
is the highest authority in this company.

583
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,360
I can learn a lot from following him.

584
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,880
What do I need to pay attention to?

585
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,400
Have you ever seen
a thief ask the police

586
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,810
how to avoid surveillance cameras?

587
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,200
I really want to join Cyan.

588
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,810
Just help me.

589
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,290
Why should I help you?

590
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,330
Because you've helped me once before.

591
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,920
Just wait here for a while.

592
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,200
Okay.

593
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,330
Ms. Jiang, hello.

594
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,530
- Ms. Jiang.
- A beauty. Sit.

595
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,680
Do you mind if I touch up my makeup?

596
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,170
Of course not.

597
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,290
Do you prefer cats or dogs?

598
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,250
Both, but I haven't raised them.

599
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,970
Is this position

600
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,250
for feeding cats or walking dogs?

601
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,640
I'm allergic to dog hair.

602
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,840
The other day, after I got my nails done,
I went to play pool.

603
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,250
I bumped my nails a little.

604
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,170
It's not obvious.

605
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,440
Do you play pool?

606
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,530
No, but I can learn.

607
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,810
This one.

608
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,400
You're wearing silk today.

609
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Very shiny.

610
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,160
Lip gloss might overshadow it.

611
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,090
Matte would be better.

612
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,370
You can go now.

613
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,930
Thank you, Ms. Jiang.

614
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,220
(Resume)

615
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,600
Come in.

616
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
Want to see me?

617
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,270
I heard from HR

618
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,760
that over 20 people were interviewed.

619
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,280
You chose the prettiest one for me.

620
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,570
To enhance my image?

621
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,680
Looks are just a bonus for her.

622
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,160
She performed quite well

623
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,680
in terms of artistic taste

624
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,930
and responsiveness.

625
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,090
The most important thing

626
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,680
is having accurate self-awareness.

627
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,050
She just graduated this year.

628
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,160
It's the best time for training.

629
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,160
I'll use her.

630
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,530
Training is your job.

631
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,080
No problem.

632
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,970
Making this decision
must have been difficult.

633
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,120
She needs to have your abilities

634
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,410
and yet not your ambitions.

635
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,450
She must be able to assist me

636
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,850
without becoming your opponent.

637
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,690
It's quite challenging.

638
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,530
But you like her, right?

639
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,560
Look.

640
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,600
Mom, haven't I told you?

641
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,050
Stop introducing girlfriends to me.

642
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,000
They're all

643
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,410
distant relatives

644
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,890
of your neighbors and colleagues.

645
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,090
I don't even know if they're real.

646
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,050
Love requires chemistry.

647
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,370
What can you tell from a photo?

648
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,010
Take a look.

649
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,770
(School of Chemistry)
Looks good.

650
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,160
Who's she?

651
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,370
You want a chemical reaction, right?

652
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,800
She happens to study chemistry.

653
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,600
She's a PhD student
in Professor Liang's Chemistry Department.

654
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,850
It's her first year as a PhD.

655
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,330
A female PhD?

656
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,890
I'm a master.
Would she be interested in me?

657
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,240
Then let her have a look.

658
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,740
I'll give you her number.
You make the arrangements later.

659
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,200
Then I'll take her out for dinner first.

660
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,890
And then we'll go see a movie.

661
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,890
Okay.

662
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,200
You scared me.

663
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
Dad,

664
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,490
I'm about to start work.

665
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,200
I'll leave early and come back late.

666
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,530
It's quite tiring.

667
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,370
What if you can't reach me?

668
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,690
You'll be

669
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,450
worried about me.

670
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,450
You can work.

671
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,640
We'll never disturb you.

672
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,570
What if you can't reach me?

673
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,690
We'll reach your brother.

674
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,810
Dad,

675
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,240
I need a cellphone.

676
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,640
You don't have to pay the full amount.

677
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,890
Just contribute a bit.

678
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,720
No one uses pagers anymore.

679
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,850
And for work,

680
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,050
I need to be in contact
with people, right?

681
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,680
Dad, your bonsai is nice.

682
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,090
It's a branch
from a hundred-year-old tree.

683
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,560
Look at this.

684
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,410
The shape.

685
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,410
The ambiance.

686
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,640
Impeccable.

687
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,520
Right?

688
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,720
No wonder Uncle Wu said

689
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,890
it's worth at least five hundred.

690
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,320
Then why did you tell Mom

691
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
you bought it for fifty?

692
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,800
I got a good deal.

693
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,570
Should I tell Mom how much

694
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,120
this bonsai is really worth?

695
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,090
Let her praise you.

696
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,410
I'll give you the money later, okay?

697
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,090
Not later, now.

698
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,050
How did you know?

699
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,640
Give me.

700
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,370
Fine. I'm giving it to you.

701
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,040
We've agreed.

702
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,410
Leave me with some for fertilizers.

703
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,690
Here.

704
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,080
Thank you, Dad.

705
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,320
When I earn money, I'll pay you back.

706
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,160
Consider it a loan.

707
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,600

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,810

Blame me

757
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,120
for underestimating her charm

758

at the institute.
