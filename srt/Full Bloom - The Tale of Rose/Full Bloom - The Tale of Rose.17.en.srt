00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,560
I just wanted to ask you

4
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,200
if you wanted to have dinner together.

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,310
Sorry. I can't tonight.

6
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
That's okay.

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
What do you need?

8
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Not really.

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,350
I just wanted
to treat you to some noodles.

10
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,870
I'll take a rain check then.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,150
You look great in that dress.

12
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,600
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

13
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,520
Ms. Jiang,

14
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,270
I really appreciate your trust in me.

15
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,920
But now,

16
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,310
I'm different from before.

17
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
Wearing a beautiful dress

18
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
and chatting with people

19
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,240
I'll probably

20
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,390
never meet again

21
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,920
no longer means anything to me.

22
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,390
Are you leaving?

23
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,070
Now, I want to learn things

24
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm not good at.

25
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,720
To cook a meal,

26
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,720
and cherish the people around me.

27
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,630
These are the real challenges for me.

28
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Hello, your cake is ready.

29
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200

48
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm not mad at her,

49
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,000
just disappointed.

50
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,680
Can you imagine what she's become now?

51
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,240
When I first met her,

52
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,270
she dressed like a poor student.

53
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,270
Well, she is a poor student.

54
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,920
I understand

55
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,310
a young girl's curiosity,

56
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,940
but I can't understand

57
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,920
why she would ruin her future

58
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,480
over it.

59
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,950
Maybe to her,

60
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,600
the future isn't that important.

61
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,560
What matters most is how she feels now.

62
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,270
Huang Yimei
comes from a scholarly family,

63
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,600
so her perspective is different.

64
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Plus, she's smart,

65
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,950
talented, and privileged.

66
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,270
So, she can afford

67
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,510
to make reckless choices in life.

68
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,680
Recklessness comes from
having things too easy.

69
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,950
Alright, I'm done talking.

70
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,310
I need to go entertain guests.

71
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
That's it for now.

72
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,950
You know my sister too well.

73
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,240
You and my sister are soulmates.

74
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,870
Good thing she's a woman.

75
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,040
Otherwise, we'd fight over you.

76
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,190
When will you

77
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,600
analyze me like that?

78
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,640
You?

79
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,040
I can't analyze you.

80
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
I don't know you that well.

81
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,200
And you agreed to be with me?

82
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,790
Knowing too much
means we can't be together.

83
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,990
Why?

84
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,550
How can I make the girl peel shrimp?

85
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
No more shrimp peeling.

86
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,670
What's your logic?

87
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,440
Knowing too much...

88
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,680
Try it.

89
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,080
Is it cooked right?

90
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,870
Perfect.

91
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
Yes, try the fish.

92
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,360
How did you know it was my birthday?

93
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,600
When I helped you
register at the hospital,

94
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,910
I vaguely remembered it was this month.

95
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,750
Then you suddenly wanted noodles.

96
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
What about your original plan?

97
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,440
It's okay. This is more important.

98
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Go ahead and try it.

99
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
I don't cook much.

100
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Don't laugh at me.

101
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,870
This is the best birthday noodles

102
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,080
I've ever had.

103
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
How do you lie so easily?

104
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,030
I forgot to add salt.

105
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
It's delicious.

106
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,360
I didn't know you could cook.

107
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,600
Happy birthday to you.

108
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,000
Happy birthday to you.

109
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,670
Happy birthday to you.

110
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,120
Happy birth...

111
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,230
Sorry.

112
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Happy birthday.

113
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,990
Thank you.

114
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,590
Let me make a wish.

115
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,260
(Spring, 2006)

116
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,590
Dad, Mom.

117
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,510
Rose, you're home?

118
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
Tiny, come.

119
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,630
Wish Grandma and Grandpa

120
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,440
a happy anniversary.

121
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
Happy anniversary.

122
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,150
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

123
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,720
Thanks for the gift, Rose.

124
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,320
How is it? Pretty, right?

125
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,320
Your dad insists the red one is his.

126
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,790
We even argued over it.

127
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,510
Red for men, green for women, right?

128
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,750
Does it suit an old man

129
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,910
to wear such a bright color?

130
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,030
Look, it looks great.

131
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,720
- Rose, how's it going?
- Matching well.

132
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,440
I miss you.

133
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,080
I miss you too.

134
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,910
I have some time before graduation,

135
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,670
I can visit home.

136
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,790
- Great.
- That's wonderful. Come home soon.

137
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,670
Can I bring someone along?

138
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,040
Who?

139
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,750
Is it Fang?

140
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,670
Rose is bringing
her boyfriend to Beijing.

141
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
I think

142
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
as they're meeting my parents,

143
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
we might as well take the chance too.

144
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,000
Maybe you should meet my parents too.

145
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,670
Didn't we agree not to meet parents yet?

146
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,030
Can't avoid it forever.

147
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,720
When we get married,

148
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,790
and my parents come by,

149
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,550
will you cover yourself with a cloth

150
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,630
like a regent?

151
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,080
Do you want to get married?

152
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,440
Don't you?

153
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
I haven't thought about it.

154
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,270
Do you think it's too early?

155
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Don't men think marriage

156
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,270
is the grave of love?

157
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,790
That's for those they don't love enough.

158
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,600
So, it depends on the person.

159
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,360
Marriage isn't important.

160
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,550
Who you marry is.

161
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,480
Do you feel comfortable with me?

162
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,560
Yes.

163
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,150
Me too.

164
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
Then let's stay comfortable together.

165
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Come, this way.

166
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
Come in.

167
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,110
Mom says no need to change shoes.

168
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,320
- Just come in.
- Okay.

169
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,630
Coming. Coming.

170
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,240
Mom, they're here.

171
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,590
Coming. Coming.

172
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,790
- Dad, Mom.
- Rose.

173
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,710
Dad, Mom.

174
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,550
I'm covered in oil.

175
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
Come here.

176
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,720
This is Fang.

177
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
These are my parents.

178
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,910
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Huang.

179
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

180
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Come in and sit. Don't be shy.

181
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
Sit, sit.

182
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,390
- Sit down.
- Okay.

183
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,870
Come, sit down.

184
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,910
I have two more dishes to finish.

185
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,230
You sit first.

186
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
Mrs. Huang, let me help you.

187
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,750
No need, no need.

188
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,590
- You don't have to.
- Fang.

189
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,550
Sit, sit down.

190
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
Okay.

191
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,710
Have some of this.

192
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

193
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,480
Is this your first time in Beijing?

194
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes, first time.

195
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,240
How long can you stay?

196
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,750
I planned to take a week off,

197
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,790
but my boss only gave me three days.

198
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,230
I have to go back
the day after tomorrow.

199
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,840
That's tight.

200
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,110
Zhenhua,

201
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,750
how about this?

202
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,720
Why don't you drive them around

203
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,280
for the next two days?

204
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,360
I have to work.

205
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
I'll give you the car.

206
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,900
You can go around yourselves.

207
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,000
Mr. Huang, no need.

208
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,230
This time,

209
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
we came to see you.

210
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
We can tour around

211
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,760
next time.

212
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,270
That's fine.

213
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,910
Zhenhua,

214
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
I brought you a gift.

215
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,030
Come to my room and see.

216
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,350
You brought me a gift?

217
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,680
That's rare.

218
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,920
What did you bring?

219
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,920
He's here for the first time.

220
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,550
You should be a good host.

221
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,160
How can I be a better host?

222
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,830
I picked you up from the train station.

223
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,830
Besides, our parents are the hosts,

224
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,670
not me.

225
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,890
Weren't you worried about me?

226
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,240
I brought him here.

227
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,550
Can't you say something nice?

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,350
No need to be fake about it.

229
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Do you not like him?

230
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,070
I didn't say anything.

231
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,110
Exactly, you didn't say anything.

232
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,240
You usually chat

233
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
with sales calls.

234
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,510
He's okay.

235
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,830
Looks tall

236
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,160
and polite,

237
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,200
but not very sophisticated.

238
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,440
You can tell he's not from a big city.

239
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,280
And you are?

240
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,590
Do you live in the Forbidden City?

241
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,480
Not comparing to me.

242
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,320
Zhuang...

243
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,590
Fine, fine. Let's drop it.

244
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,160
What would you like to drink?

245
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,680
Tea or cola?

246
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,590
Thank you. I'm not thirsty.

247
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,750
I'll have a cola.

248
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Alright.

249
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,950
I'll get it for you.

250
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,390
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

251
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,840
No trouble at all.

252
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,480
My boyfriend

253
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,170
doesn't need to be compared to anyone.

254
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
Yes, I'm not comparing him to others.

255
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,680
He just looks like your sidekick

256
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,030
next to you, not a good match.

257
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,150
Fang,

258
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
what do you do for a living?

259
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,590
I work at an internet company

260
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,830
as a system architect,

261
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,550
responsible for
logical architecture design.

262
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,070
Logical architecture?

263
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,590
In simple terms, designing software.

264
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,440
Oh, software.

265
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,200
Mr. Huang, I heard from Yimei

266
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,270
that you have a lot of books.

267
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,000
She's right.

268
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,240
Every time we move,

269
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,720
the books are the hardest to part with.

270
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,320
Fang,

271
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,510
let me show you around.

272
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,630
Okay.

273
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,510
If Mom and Dad ask

274
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,270
which one is better, him or the last one,

275
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,110
what should I say?

276
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
They aren't like you.

277
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,160
They won't ask.

278
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,310
If they do, I'll tell the truth.

279
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,550
If you embarrass me,

280
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,350
I'll get back at you.

281
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
I'd like to see that.

282
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,160
When I bring Su home,

283
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,270
I'd like to see how you'll do that.

284
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,920
I'll show her your childhood photo

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,280
where you were wearing a dress,

286
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,630
with a red lip
and a dot on your forehead.

287
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,550
Does that still exist?

288
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,880
No, no, no.

289
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,270
I'm sorry. Sorry.

290
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,310
I'll praise him, alright?

291
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,590
I've read this book,

292
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,750
but the cover was different.

293
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,240
This one is the sixth edition.

294
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,350
I might have read a newer version.

295
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,520
Maybe.

296
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,510
The part about Eastern history

297
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
was uncomfortable to read.

298
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,510
The author analyzes us

299
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
from a Western perspective,

300
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,510
which is a bit unfair.

301
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,310
Mr. Huang, I'm just talking nonsense.

302
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,510
I'm just an amateur here.

303
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,750
You're right.

304
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,680
Some of the author's views

305
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,440
are biased.

306
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
But that's history.

307
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,880
Everyone sees it
from their own perspective.

308
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,960
It's hard to see the whole picture.

309
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
However, reading outside your field

310
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,030
and bringing in your own thoughts

311
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,480
is great.

312
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,960
This edition's author

313
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,680
is relatively more objective.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,110
Dinner is ready.

315
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,080
Coming.

316
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,350
Let's eat first.

317
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,790
- Alright.
- We'll talk later.

318
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,040
Here.

319
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,160
Have some shrimp.

320
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you, Mrs. Huang.

321
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,240
You're welcome. Here, try this.

322
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,200
The meat is good too.

323
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,350
- Fang.
- Eat.

324
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,790
Today's dishes are all homemade.

325
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,630
Yes, yes.

326
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,030
Hope you like them.

327
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,560
They look delicious.

328
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,640
He likes them.

329
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
- That's good.
- And this braised pork.

330
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
- My specialty.
- Eat more.

331
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,020
- I'll serve myself, thank you.
- Okay.

332
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,950
- Don't be shy, eat.
- Thank you.

333
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,040
Eat.

334
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,870
- Is it good?
- The meat is great.

335
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,630
Eat more.

336
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,400
Let me get you some.

337
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,720
Last time, Mrs. Huang taught me
to make braised pork.

338
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,910
I tried several times,

339
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,830
but I couldn't get
the caramelized sugar right.

340
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,720
- Really?
- Either it didn't color,

341
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,590
or it burned.

342
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,680
When caramelizing sugar,

343
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,790
you shouldn't add oil.

344
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,830
Add water instead.
It's easier to control.

345
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,760
That's a good tip.

346
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,440
I'll try that next time.

347
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,400
I was afraid of burning it,

348
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,400
so I used red yeast

349
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,590
for color.

350
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,000
- You like to think.
- Red yeast.

351
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
That's great.

352
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,430
Good job.

353
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
You,

354
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,790
eating it for years,

355
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,640
only know it's tasty.

356
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,080
Fang,

357
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
do you still cook every day
despite working?

358
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,510
At the company, I eat simply,

359
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,240
but on weekends I cook at home

360
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,160
with Rose.

361
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,110
She can cook?

362
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,510
Dad, do you really think I'm a delicate

363
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,550
and can't tell rice from wheat?

364
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,680
Remember when you made fish ball soup?

365
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,510
You added green onions,
cilantro, and pepper.

366
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,550
When you served it, we wondered

367
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
why the fish balls were so big.

368
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,350
Turned out

369
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,240
they were sweet rice balls.

370
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,510
Southerners even have
meat-filled rice balls.

371
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,780
What's wrong with green onions?

372
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,880
Have studying in Shanghai for a few years

373
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,270
made you a Southerner?

374
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Seriously not planning
to come back to Beijing?

375
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,150
Mr. and Mrs. Huang,

376
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,270
if Rose decides to return to Beijing,

377
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,640
I'll support her,

378
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,190
and

379
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,720
come with her.

380
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,550
Aren't you working at Shanheng Tech?

381
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,200
- Yes.
- That's a big company.

382
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,350
What's your position?

383
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,070
At Development Department,
currently a project manager.

384
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,440
Impressive.

385
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,880
Will you look for a similar job
in Beijing?

386
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,190
Actually,

387
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,920
I received an offer

388
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,830
from a state-owned company,

389
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,350
doing system integration.

390
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,590
That's not your field.

391
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,640
In Beijing,

392
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm more concerned about the location

393
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
and stability.

394
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,550
Don't just talk.

395
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,030
Here.

396
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,110
Welcome, Fang.

397
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,240
- Come on.
- Here.

398
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,650
- Come on.
- A toast to you.

399
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,960
- Mrs. Huang.
- Alright. Here.

400
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,680
Cheers.

401
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
He definitely won't go back
to his hometown.

402
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,070
So staying in either Beijing or Shanghai

403
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,960
is the best choice for him.

404
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,310
You didn't see how determined

405
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,540
he acted at dinner tonight.

406
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,940
He'd go through fire and water
for my sister.

407
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,270
My sister would surely fall for that.

408
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,430
True.

409
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,070
Rose and Zhuang Guodong broke up

410
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,960
because of the long distance.

411
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,720
Do you think Rose doesn't see that?

412
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,750
You know how she is in relationships.

413
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
She's all in from the start,

414
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,310
like a gambler.

415
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,680
Aren't you being too suspicious?

416
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,440
Thinking everyone is out to get you?

417
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,790
It's wise to be cautious.

418
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,160
Once Rose is committed,

419
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,640
she's unwavering.

420
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,590
She enjoys the process,

421
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,830
unlike some people

422
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,880
who are cautious,

423
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,510
calculating for their goals,

424
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,560
and living too carefully.

425
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,510
Are you

426
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,000
implying something?

427
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,880
It's from a famous brand.

428
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
Good.

429
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,350
The gifts hit the mark.

430
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,310
Do you like him?

431
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,880
Though he looks tall,

432
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,110
he's polite

433
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,640
and modest.

434
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,350
He's also a good learner.

435
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,750
Everything about him is good.

436
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,110
High praise.

437
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,960
Everything's good,

438
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,200
but too good to be true.

439
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Did you listen to him speak?

440
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
He didn't miss a beat,

441
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,750
agreeing with everything.

442
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,510
But do you know what he really thinks?

443
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,270
He's willing to come to Beijing for Rose.

444
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,030
That's his sincerity.

445
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,160
What if things

446
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,310
don't work out,

447
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
and he blames her?

448
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,880
Stop overthinking.

449
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,760
Get ready for sleep.

450
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,640
Drink this organic milk

451
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,480
and sleep well.

452
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,550
You women

453
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,880
don't understand men.

454
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,590
Men can be deceitful.

455
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,590
I'm worried our daughter

456
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,240
isn't great at picking men.

457
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,640
Of course.

458
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,110
After all, she takes after me
in that regard.

459
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,000
Do you like your current job?

460
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,590
I do,

461
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,880
but any job gets

462
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,190
routine after a while.

463
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,960
When you talk

464
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
about new releases,

465
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,830
interfaces,

466
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,830
and data,

467
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,440
I don't get it,

468
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,830
but I can feel

469
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,110
your enthusiasm.

470
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,440
The Beijing job is good too.

471
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,550
A state-owned enterprise is more stable,

472
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,910
with no overtime.

473
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,200
I can have more time to take care of you.

474
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,670
Most importantly,

475
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,040
it's closer to your home.

476
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,070
I grew up in a small town,

477
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,100
unlike you

478
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,540
and other sophisticated people in Beijing

479
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,550
with broad perspectives.

480
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
I studied hard

481
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
to improve my life.

482
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,350
It may sound funny.

483
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't quit just yet.

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
I haven't decided.

485
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,240
Alright.

486
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,310
You've been putting it off.

487
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,960
When will you transfer
the property to my name?

488
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,270
The house is already in both our names.

489
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,390
When I die,

490
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,590
it will all be yours.

491
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,640
If you don't do it,

492
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,720
that jerk could get a share
after you die.

493
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,270
What are you saying?

494
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,200
Are you wishing me dead?

495
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,920
It's a legal risk.

496
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,720
I won't let him take my money

497
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,070
and my dad's house.

498
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,030
(Difficult Case Clinic)
Alright, do you think I'm stupid?

499
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,830
If we transfer it now,

500
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,830
you might sell it.

501
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,790
Where will we live then?

502
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,880
Stop being unreasonable.

503
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,960
I said I won't sell the house,

504
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,030
and I mean it.

505
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,110
I'll find time in a couple of days

506
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,680
to handle it.

507
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,620
(Difficult Case Clinic)

508
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,030
Sun, note down the account for me.

509
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,390
Dinner's ready?

510
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,110
What's wrong?

511
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,000
Nothing.

512
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,160
Tell me.

513
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
Maybe I can help.

514
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
No need, I'll handle it.

515
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,310
Are they asking you for money again?

516
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,590
How much?

517
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,270
I've saved some.

518
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,000
Does your money
have anything to do with me?

519
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,200
I mean, if you need it urgently,

520
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,350
you can use it.

521
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,960
Money doesn't solve everything.

522
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,510
I said you can't help with my problem.

523
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,160
How do you know

524
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,720
if you don't tell me?

525
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,390
Let's drop it

526
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,760
and eat first.

527
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,510
The stir-fried beef is good.

528
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
Su.

529
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,000
Where were we?

530
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,110
What were you thinking?

531
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,550
Want to stay in Shanghai?

532
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
I'm already sending out resumes.

533
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,400
Your fields

534
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,960
can also thrive in Beijing.

535
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,960
Are you going to stay in Shanghai

536
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,830
because he can't leave his job?

537
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,400
Not exactly.

538
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,350
Whether it is or isn't,

539
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,400
you just want to sacrifice yourself.

540
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,240
Is this a sacrifice?

541
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,510
Are you fooling yourself

542
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,070
or convincing yourself?

543
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,920
When you were with Zhuang Guodong,

544
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,080
it was the same.

545
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,030
You haven't learned from it.

546
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,110
Can't you live without a man?

547
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,790
Do you have to revolve around a man?

548
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,350
How can you say that?

549
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,750
Huang Yimei, can you wake up?

550
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,400
You've been through this before.

551
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,000
You've been educated for more years.

552
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,110
You should be mature.

553
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,880
Why are you still
paying for a man's choice?

554
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
Why do you always
think the worst of people?

555
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,310
Fine, if you don't like it,
I won't say more.

556
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,350
I know you're looking out for me,

557
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,160
but you can't judge everyone
the same way.

558
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,310
Aren't you overly cautious?

559
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,000
Afraid your trust

560
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,550
will backfire?

561
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,590
Stop it.

562
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,070
Don't analyze me

563
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,230
with your psychology knowledge.

564
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,920
Su, I know you've had tough times.

565
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,110
But therapies can help you.

566
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,310
If you want,

567
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,550
I can refer you

568
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,640
to a great therapist.

569
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,680
Huang Yimei, stop.

570
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,830
I'm perfectly fine.

571
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,350
Don't treat me like your patient.

572
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,830
Tell us when you're there.

573
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,800
Alright.

574
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,110
Fang,

575
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,270
we hope you'll visit more often.

576
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,110
Definitely.

577
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,190
Okay.

578
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,150
Mrs. Huang.

579
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,190
Okay, Mrs. Huang.

580
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,550
Take care of my sister.

581
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,880
Don't worry, Zhenhua.

582
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,000
Goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. Huang.

583
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,030
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

584
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,960
Goodbye, Zhenhua.

585
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,200
You should go back now.

586
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,920
Think about what you want to eat tonight.

587
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,720
Peking duck, BBQ, or mutton hot pot?

588
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,200
Stewed dishes or stir-fried liver?

589
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,350
Where are you now? I'll pick you up.

590
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
A sales office.
There's parking at the entrance.

591
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,240
A sales office?

592
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,350
What are you doing there?

593
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,350
I booked a house.

594
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,110
That one, on the fifth floor.

595
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,200
Great view.

596
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,790
I can see the central garden.

597
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
The compound
separates pedestrians and cars.

598
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,680
I can go jogging in the evening.

599
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,870
Nice, nice.

600
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,070
Miss Su has a great eye.

601
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,830
The building you chose is sold out.

602
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,550
And the one-bedroom unit you picked

603
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,030
is the fastest-selling type.

604
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,310
Good orientation,

605
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,000
perfect for newlyweds.

606
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,110
One-bedroom?

607
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,830
Just one bedroom?

608
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,110
Where will our son sleep?

609
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
You have a child?

610
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,950
It's okay.

611
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,360
You can look over here.

612
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,880
- No need.
- Over here.

613
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,150
I'll still decide on this one.

614
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,200
Alright.

615
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
What are you doing?

616
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,880
Are you crazy?

617
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,430
Is there something wrong
with what I said?

618
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,000
We will definitely
have a child in the future.

619
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,800
They say women make impulsive purchases.

620
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,230
I thought it would be
just a bag or shoes,

621
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,400
but you bought a house on a whim.

622
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,720
It's not impulsive.

623
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,550
I've wanted to buy a house
for a long time.

624
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,150
Then why didn't you discuss it with me?

625
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,440
Why should I discuss it with you?

626
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,030
I'm your boyfriend.

627
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,920
So what?

628
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,150
I'm still buying a house.

629
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,190
I just want a house of my own.

630
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Buying a house is a big deal.

631
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,630
Exactly.

632
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,280
So I can't tell you in advance.

633
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,510
What's the logic in that?

634
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,440
The down payment is a big amount.

635
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
And with the mortgage,

636
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,710
there will be pressure.

637
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,920
If I told you,

638
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,280
would you help me or not?

639
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,290
- Of course...
- If you didn't help me,

640
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
you'd feel guilty.

641
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,400
If you did,
the pressure would be on you.

642
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You know

643
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,550
I don't like troubling others.

644
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,440
Am I "others"?

645
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
No matter who it is,

646
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,280
I don't want to owe anyone.

647
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,400
Between us,
do we need to talk about that?

648
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,760
I'm willing to contribute to your house.

649
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,070
Isn't that natural?

650
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,110
Numbers 55 to 58,

651
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,280
come select your units.

652
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
Your turn won't be held if missed.

653
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,910
Coming.

654
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
To me, except for myself,

655
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,550
everyone else is "others".

656
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,550
I just want

657
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,230
a house of my own.

658
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,150
I don't want...

659
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,030
Any complications if we break up.

660
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,870
Right?

661
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,670
We've been together for a long time,

662
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
but I can tell

663
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,550
you've always been making

664
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,590
backup plans.

665
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
No.

666
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,020
(Jail, incoming call. Call ended.)

667
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,030
People

668
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,360
can't rely on love

669
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,880
for material support.

670
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,110
Breakups are common.

671
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,840
Whether it works out or not,

672
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,070
I don't want to owe you in any way.

673
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,280
People need some faith.

674
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,000
If you don't think
we're right for each other,

675
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,150
we won't last.

676
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't you assess risks in your projects?

677
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,400
Don't you prepare Plan B?

678
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,920
We always have to prepare for the worst,

679
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,150
but it doesn't mean

680
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,550
the worst will happen.

681
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,030
Faith stays in the heart.

682
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,510
It's not to force others.

683
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,110
Let's end here for dinner.

684
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,430
I'm not hungry.

685
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm not either. I'll take you back.

686
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,820
(Jail, incoming call)

687
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,180
(Jail, incoming call. Call ended.)

688
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,580
(Jail, incoming call. Call ended.)

689
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,800
Bye.

690
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,320
Are the dishes so dirty?

691
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,420
You've washed them
until they're worn out.

692
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,070
Did you fight with Su?

693
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,430
No.

694
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,240
Mom.

695
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,320
Do you think

696
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,320
two people

697
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,510
with very different personalities

698
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,090
and family backgrounds can be together?

699
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:50,910
They can,

700
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,150
but it's hard.

701
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,510
I've only met Su once,

702
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,480
but I've heard about her
from your sister.

703
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,320
I have a general understanding of her.

704
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,880
I think you two

705
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,150
are very different people.

706
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,590
So, do you mean

707
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,590
we are not suitable for each other?

708
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,920
There will be some ideological conflicts.

709
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,120
That's inevitable.

710
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,240
But

711
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,880
from my years of teaching,

712
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,550
I've observed

713
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,760
that a person's upbringing
has a big impact,

714
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,440
but it's not absolute.

715
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,230
Some people stay as they were molded,

716
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,710
but some

717
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,880
change completely.

718
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,630
I think Su is the latter.

719
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,510
I also think she's the latter.

720
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,800
But I feel

721
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,110
she lacks a sense of security.

722
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,710
You grew up here,

723
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,030
but she relies on herself.

724
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,980
Of course, she doesn't have
your sense of security.

725
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,800
But in terms of adaptability
and survival skills,

726
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,920
she's much stronger.

727
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,280
If you like her,

728
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,110
consider her perspective more.

729
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,550
But she doesn't appreciate it.

730
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,190
She bought a house
without discussing it with me.

731
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
I offered to help,

732
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,030
and she acted like
I was loaning her money.

733
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,400
You get to know someone over time.

734
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,480
Take it slow.

735
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,320
Mom,

736
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,190
if you weren't always cooking meat,

737
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,000
I'd think you'd become a Buddha.

738
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
Not only do you need to grow,

739
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,280
but parents also need to grow.

740
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,190
Or we'd fall behind the times.

741
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,630
Learning is lifelong.

742
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,400
Yes.

743
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,880
Huang Yimei,

744
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,550
your graduation thesis is

745
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,960
"The Effect of Art Therapy

746
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,360
on Children with Autism."

747
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,100
(Thesis Defense Meeting)

748
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,470
Hello?

749
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,000
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

750
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,920
I'm signing the house contract today.

751
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,880
I'll be back later.

752
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,350
Alright then.

753
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,920
