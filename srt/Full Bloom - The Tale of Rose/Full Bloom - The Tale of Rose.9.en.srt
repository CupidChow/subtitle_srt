(Cyan Art)

4
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,720
So, our first group of confirmed guests

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,010
are influential collectors and artists.

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,320
They tend to be

7
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,460
more forward-thinking and discerning,

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,340
with a higher acceptance
of avant-garde art.

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,710
Their evaluations

10
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,500
can guide the general audience.

11
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,520
Besides that,

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,560
we also intend to invite

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,690
other creative industry professionals,

14
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,230
such as designers,

15
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,270
musicians,

16
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,230
art consultants,

17
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,180
curators, and cultural event organizers.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,340
They all pay close attention
to innovative art practices.

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,300
Why aren't you eating?

20
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
Eat.

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Here.

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,940

47
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,980
Hello,

48
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,300
who is this?

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,140
This restaurant has been around

50
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,820
for at least twenty or thirty years.

51
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,420
When I was young,

52
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,260
I used to come here often.

53
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,460
Try some.

54
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,260
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

55
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,900
Just tell me.

56
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,780
What do you need?

57
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Didn't I tell you

58
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,620
I'd bring Guodong to you

59
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,660
to apologize?

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,940
I couldn't catch him,

61
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,020
so I thought

62
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,420
I'd invite you for a meal

63
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,700
to apologize on his behalf.

64
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,580
No need.

65
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,140
We already broke up.

66
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,660
I'm not joking.

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,740
Of course.

68
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,780
I understand.

69
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,260
Feelings aren't something to joke about.

70
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,260
But breaking up

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,140
just means

72
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,780
the relationship changes.

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,700
It doesn't necessarily end the feelings,

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,940
right?

75
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,020
That's hard to say.

76
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,700
Have you read "Journey to the West"?

77
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,220
Do you remember the part
where the Tang Monk sweeps the tower?

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,340
There's a luminous pearl inside the tower

79
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,660
stolen by demons.

80
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,540
Two demons, right?

81
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,380
Yes, yes,

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,340
that part.

83
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,580
What's it got to do with me?

84
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,340
When the Tang Monk sweeps the tower,

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,140
he starts from the bottom up.

86
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,700
Don't you think he's a bit clueless?

87
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,780
Once he cleans the bottom,

88
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,380
cleaning the top

89
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,380
makes the bottom dirty again.

90
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,580
Right?

91
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,060
The director must have forgotten.

92
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,580
It's Buddhist philosophy.

93
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,940
Cultivation must proceed from the bottom up,
from simplicity to complexity.

94
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,540
No one can reach the top in one step.

95
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,780
Even if someone does,
it's just a castle in the air.

96
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,300
It's the same with relationships.

97
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,140
The meeting is fate.

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,020
To stay together forever,

99
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,580
you need to truly know each other.

100
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,460
You have to do it step by step.

101
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,700
Right?

102
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,900
If you know from the start
it's not suitable,

103
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,220
why waste time?

104
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,140
Let's talk about the second meaning
of sweeping the tower.

105
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,900
People

106
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,460
don't live in the past,

107
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,180
nor in the future,

108
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,180
but in the present.

109
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,660
Sweep the dust in front of you.

110
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,340
Yesterday is gone,

111
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,540
and tomorrow is uncertain.

112
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,180
Yes,

113
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,660
the future is uncertain.

114
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,900
There's nothing to expect.

115
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,220
Quick, eat.

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,780
The meat's getting tough.

117
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,640
- Here, have some.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,380
A breakup

119
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,460
shouldn't affect my appetite.

120
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,700
That's the spirit.

121
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
Huang,

122
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,700
I see you have wisdom.

123
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,390
You're tall,

124
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,540
so give me some leeway.

125
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Also,

126
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,900
I know my sister's character.

127
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,380
When she gets angry,

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,900
her words cut straight to the heart.

129
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,180
You're older than her,

130
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,260
so be more tolerant.

131
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,220
Don't argue with her.

132
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,140
I'm not arguing with her.

133
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,420
Anyway, she's already broken up with me.

134
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,500
When did that happen?

135
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,620
Come on, I won't go easy on you.

136
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,580
Why?

137
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,100
What's the reason for your breakup?

138
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,940
Want to know?

139
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,100
Beat me, and I'll tell you.

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,540
Come on, Huang.

141
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,960
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

142
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,060
The third meaning of sweeping the tower

143
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,700
is the floors get dirtied.

144
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,140
Each time you sweep,

145
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,980
looking back,

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,340
the once clean place is dirty again.

147
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,820
It shows you've matured.

148
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,580
Looking back on past actions

149
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,620
and decisions,

150
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,180
you'll find them naive and laughable.

151
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,220
You mean

152
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,900
I'll regret

153
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,940
breaking up with him?

154
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,100
Maybe he'll be the one who regrets it.

155
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,060
He won't.

156
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,620
He's gone,

157
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,460
without a trace.

158
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,780
When a woman is heartbroken,
she confides.

159
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,340
When a man is heartbroken, he is silent.

160
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
He's not silent.

161
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,140
He's emotionally abusive.

162
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,660
He's inexperienced.

163
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,980
A man like me

164
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
is experienced.

165
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,340
An old hand,

166
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,900
glib-tongued, distorting the truth.

167
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,020
Do you like someone like me?

168
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,820
Uncle,

169
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,220
you're quite self-aware.

170
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,100
Yes.

171
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,060
It's clarity, right?

172
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,580
Now, the fourth meaning
of sweeping the tower...

173
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,420
Uncle,

174
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,820
the Tang Monk

175
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,020
didn't have so many inner thoughts.

176
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,260
You're just trying to persuade me

177
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
to reconcile, right?

178
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,180
No, I'm not.

179
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,620
I don't do that.

180
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,020
I'm not persuading you.

181
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,140
I just have one question.

182
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,180
Do you still

183
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,300
like him now?

184
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,940
There's no final decision.

185
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,900
A first judgment can still be appealed.

186
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,940
She broke up with you out of anger.

187
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,340
She's waiting for you to appeal.

188
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
Appeal what?

189
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,220
She wants me to give up my job in Paris.

190
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,060
I can't do that.

191
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,100
And if I go to her now to make up,

192
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,020
she'll just say
I'm making empty promises

193
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,340
and won't change.

194
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
She's a bit hot-tempered,

195
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,180
but she's not unreasonable.

196
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,920
She wrecked my house.

197
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,060
Did she have a reason to wreck it?

198
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,380
She wrecked your house?

199
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,740
She has a violent side too?

200
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,140
Have you heard of a split personality?

201
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,060
I bet it wasn't Huang Yimei
who wrecked your house that day.

202
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,540
A split personality?

203
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,860
Why not say

204
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,300
she was possessed?

205
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Girls can be persuaded by reason
but not be cowed by force.

206
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Explain nicely,

207
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,020
and she might understand.

208
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Huang,

209
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,380
I heard

210
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,620
you just broke up too.

211
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,940
You're single now,

212
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,940
and you're giving me advice?

213
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,000
I have no experience,
but I've learned my lesson.

214
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,100
We're now part of
the heartbreak alliance.

215
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,220
We need to support each other.

216
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,260
Support?

217
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,600
Nothing is more fun than basketball.

218
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,900
Come on, let's continue.

219
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,540
Do you still like her?

220
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,980
Oh, my.

221
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,380
(Adjustable dumbbells, 20kg,
available for pickup in Haidian, Beijing)

222
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,300
(Your dumbbells look good?)

223
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,780
(So heavy, I can't use them.
It's tempting, but I'm not in Beijing)

224
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,700
(Endless Life to Big-Face Huang:
They work even better.)

225
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,580
(Reply to Endless Life:
Where can we meet?)

226
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,660
I didn't see Unit 3.

227
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,380
It's Building 7.

228
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,140
That security guard gave me directions.

229
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,700
There's a pond nearby, right?

230
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,180
And that looks like a small park.

231
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm in the small park.

232
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,180
Where are you?

233
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,460
I see Unit 3 now.

234
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,300
Where are you?

235
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,500
Coming down.

236
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,860
Are you wearing

237
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,820
a striped shirt?

238
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,260
Yes. Where are you?

239
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,180
I'm on your left.

240
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,020
Here, here.

241
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,060
Here.

242
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,500
It's you?

243
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,060
You're Endless Life?

244
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,540
What a coincidence.

245
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,500
Such a small world.

246
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,980
A coincidence indeed.

247
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,860
Indeed, indeed.

248
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,180
Buying dumbbells?

249
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,980
Why buy dumbbells?

250
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,300
To work out, of course.

251
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
If I wanted to smash walnuts,
I'd buy a hammer.

252
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,060
I need to ask to make sure.

253
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,980
What if someone
buys dumbbells for bad deeds?

254
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,020
I wouldn't want to be implicated.

255
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,740
Did you grab a cactus as a kid?

256
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,940
Why are you always so prickly?

257
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,420
Have you trained before?

258
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,460
Beginners shouldn't use 20kg.

259
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,300
It's easy to get injured.

260
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,660
Don't underestimate me.

261
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,020
Inspect the goods.

262
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,580
They don't look 70% new.

263
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Can you make it cheaper?

264
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,220
Do you want it or not?

265
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,820
If not, I have another buyer.

266
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,460
Fine, put them back.

267
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,100
No, no, okay.

268
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,380
We're half acquaintances.

269
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,860
Agreed at fifty yuan, right?

270
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,220
Cash for goods.

271
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Real money.

272
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,300
My salary from work.

273
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,340
Fine.

274
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,460
See you never.

275
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,820
As if I wanted to see you.

276
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,020
Saved fifty yuan.

277
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,140
What's wrong?

278
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,820
What's wrong?

279
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,860
This...

280
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,700
Are you okay?

281
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,820
You... This...

282
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,340
You...

283
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I can't take it.

284
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,380
Don't touch it.

285
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,980
It's the same foot again.

286
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,380
Luckily, not the same spot.

287
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,300
Last time it was the ankle,

288
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,660
and this time the toe.

289
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,940
Doctor, is it serious?

290
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,820
Should I get a cast?

291
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,660
No need for that.

292
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,860
No bone damage.

293
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,420
Rest and you'll be fine.

294
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,300
And ice it.

295
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,260
It will heal faster.

296
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,230
I'll prescribe some medicine.

297
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,860
Give me some painkillers too.

298
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,500
Thank you, doctor.

299
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,460
Also,

300
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,940
you can't use it for now.

301
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,980
How will you get home?

302
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,500
No family to accompany you?

303
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,820
Where is she?

304
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,220
Here you go.

305
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,120
How should I sit with these two?

306
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,980
Take them.

307
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,620
Grab the two loops on the sides
to move forward.

308
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,540
This is the brake.

309
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,940
- When you...
- No need for instructions.

310
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,700
I know how to handle

311
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
this hand-powered little convertible.

312
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,220
Fine, I'm off.

313
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,220
My foot got hurt by your dumbbells.

314
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,660
You're responsible
for the complications.

315
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,140
We exchanged money for goods.

316
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,300
The transaction is done.

317
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,820
Your foot got hurt
by your own dumbbells.

318
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,020
I've already gone above and beyond

319
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,900
by bringing you to the hospital.

320
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,740
What do you want?

321
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,100
Are you trying to scam me?

322
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,700
Scam you?

323
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,880
If your box hadn't been flimsy,

324
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,960
would the dumbbells have fallen

325
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,820
and hurt my foot?

326
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,740
How am I scamming you?

327
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,180
I didn't get hurt carrying it.

328
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,180
You knew it was heavy
and didn't hold it properly.

329
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,620
You're a man. Why are you so whiny?

330
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,220
What's wrong with men?

331
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,580
Men have feelings too.

332
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,820
Do you know toes connect the heart?

333
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,860
And my mom said

334
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,540
my feet

335
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,900
are the best part of me.

336
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,980
Now they're ruined.

337
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,020
You have to take responsibility.

338
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,510
How should I take responsibility?

339
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,340
Carry you?

340
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,980
That's not necessary.

341
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,500
Just apologize and make it right.

342
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,530
The wheelchair is on my foot.

343
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,380
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,420
Look at my attitude.

345
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,180
You have no common sense,

346
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,380
hurting your own foot
with your own dumbbells.

347
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,780
Why should I apologize?

348
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
What did I do wrong?

349
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,940
Even if it's my lack of common sense,

350
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
and the dumbbells hurt my foot,

351
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,780
it did get hurt, right?

352
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,100
Aren't we kind of acquaintances?

353
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,980
Can't you just say something nice?

354
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,500
Will you say it or not?

355
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,300
I'm very annoyed right now.

356
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,180
I'm serious about this.

357
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,060
I'll say you hurt my foot
with the dumbbells.

358
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,180
There's no surveillance there.

359
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,420
What can you do about it?

360
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,340
I recorded it.

361
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
Want to listen?

362
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Anything else to say?

363
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,460
I'm leaving.

364
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,620
Didn't you say
we're kind of acquaintances?

365
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,380
Then I won't charge you

366
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,500
for the wheelchair rental.

367
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,340
Consider it a gift.

368
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,540
Take care and heal up.

369
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,100
No need.

370
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,660
I'll pay for the wheelchair rental.

371
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,580
I won't take advantage of you.

372
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
She recorded it?

373
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,980
And she left me at the hospital.

374
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,260
This is a hit-and-run.

375
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,540
And she rented me a lousy wheelchair.

376
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,380
She didn't want you
to have trouble walking.

377
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
Then give me the receipt.

378
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,620
It's a big item.
Can't throw it away or return it.

379
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,740
I waited in the wind
for two hours for a taxi.

380
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,380
Couldn't get a cab.

381
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,740
Almost got caught by city management

382
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,060
while waiting for you.

383
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,220
Alright, alright.

384
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,340
We're home. Stop complaining.

385
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,980
Give me all the contacts for Su.

386
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,660
MSN, QQ, all of it.

387
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,180
I'm not done with her.

388
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,220
What made you think of buying dumbbells?

389
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,620
I played basketball with Zhuang.

390
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,140
Made my back and legs sore.

391
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,820
Thought maybe I need more exercise,

392
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,900
so I wanted to buy some equipment.

393
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,900
Don't go.

394
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,620
Don't go. Don't move.

395
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,420
I heard you wrecked his house.

396
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Really broke up?

397
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,460
Good.

398
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,740
We have a new graduate at our office.

399
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
She's quite pretty.

400
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,820
If you've let Zhuang go,

401
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,420
I'll introduce them.

402
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,260
Will you win money

403
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,700
from being a matchmaker?

404
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,540
See, you can't let go.

405
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,900
Why are you so angry this time?

406
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,230
He's giving me the silent treatment.

407
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,820
Rose,

408
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,460
you need to grow up.

409
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,820
You can't expect a man
to revolve around you.

410
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,100
You can't be the center of his world.

411
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,940
Besides,

412
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,260
such men do exist,

413
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,380
like Zhou Shihui,

414
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,900
but you don't like him.

415
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,460
Zhou Shihui?

416
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,340
Who's that?

417
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,420
Zhou Shihui...

418
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,180
You are such a heartbreaker.

419
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,340
Okay, fine, let's not talk about him.

420
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,180
Back to Zhuang.

421
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,260
The root of your argument

422
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,740
is that he's going to France, right?

423
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,820
I didn't stop him from going,

424
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,660
but he should've discussed it

425
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,860
with me first.

426
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,820
Put yourself in his shoes.

427
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Could you do that?

428
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,620
From your college

429
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,340
and major to your job,

430
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,020
you did what pleased you.

431
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,540
Did you ever

432
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,780
consult Mom and Dad?

433
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,740
Truthfully,

434
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,020
for men at his age,

435
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,980
it's rare to be
so clear about their goals

436
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,780
and so dedicated to their dreams.

437
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,140
He's the second person
I've known like that.

438
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
Who's the first?

439
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,300
Me.

440
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,180
A man who's dedicated to his dreams

441
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,540
is likely to be dedicated to his love.

442
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,020
Even if he goes to France,

443
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,580
he won't abandon you.

444
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,180
Because the kite string

445
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,700
is in your hands.

446
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,980
How far can he fly?

447
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,580
Right?

448
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,620
Be confident.

449
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,000
Get me another glass of water.

450
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,380
Hurry.

451
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,940
I waited two hours in the wind.

452
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,620
Come on. Hurry.

453
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,660
Give me Su's

454
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,460
phone number, QQ,

455
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,740
MSN, all of it.

456
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,060
My brother told you, right?

457
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,020
Traitor.

458
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,140
What are you doing?

459
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,500
Let go.

460
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,780
I'll call for help.

461
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,620
Go ahead.

462
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,700
I'll help you call.

463
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,540
Go on.

464
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
Feel better now?

465
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,380
Are you a dog?

466
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
Where is everyone?

467
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,420
You're back.

468
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,460
Mom.

469
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,580
Just got off the plane.

470
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,940
Guangxi specialties, sea duck eggs.

471
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,980
You can't get these in Beijing.

472
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,260
Son,

473
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,160
what happened to your foot?

474
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,360
Going out with their family
is like a military expedition.

475
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,580
The old injury flared up.

476
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,020
Mom, I brought
various Guangxi specialties,

477
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,620
noodles, cakes,

478
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,740
all sorts of goodies.

479
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,900
They're for you.

480
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,380
Mom, take them.

481
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,460
A few days ago,
I met Professor Liang in the canteen.

482
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,900
He told me

483
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,100
Bai Xiaohe was in the lab all week.

484
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,500
Sorry, son.

485
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,300
Did we put too much pressure on you?

486
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,780
So you're afraid to tell us the truth?

487
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,100
No, I...

488
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,500
I just didn't want you to worry.

489
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,700
You've always shared the good news,
not the bad.

490
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,540
You're thirty now.

491
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,620
No need to be so considerate.

492
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm fine.

493
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,300
I'll be back to normal in a few days.

494
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,140
Really, it's no big deal.

495
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,740
If you'll recover in a few days,

496
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,060
then you must be really heartless.

497
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,940
Mom,

498
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,540
since you're so sincere,

499
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,260
why don't you find me another one?

500
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,060
Isn't it said that the best way
to get over someone

501
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,580
is to start a new relationship?

502
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,660
Easier said than done.

503
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,500
There aren't that many suitable girls.

504
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,220
By the way,

505
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
why is your sister's boyfriend

506
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,180
so mysterious?

507
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,260
He hasn't shown his face for so long.

508
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,820
Your attitude changed quickly.

509
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,140
You used to chase away

510
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,340
her suitors with a broom.

511
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,460
Now you're inviting him over?

512
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,780
I've always said

513
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,060
as long as she's serious about love,

514
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,700
I'll fully support her.

515
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,220
Where did you get the sea duck eggs?

516
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,620
Guangxi Office in Beijing.

517
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,820
They're pretty tasty.

518
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,140
Mom,

519
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,660
they're really good.

I like it.

If we ever move,

560
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,740
we have to take this wall.

00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,260
as compensation.

565
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,060
I didn't believe your brother

566
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,180
when he told me
you had a split personality.

567
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,100
You were like a mad dog
biting everyone before.

568
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,940
Today,

569
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
you're apologizing?

570
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,540
Let me see. Who are you?

571
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,620
Are you Huang Yimei?

572
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,780
Which one is the real you?

573
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,700
I know arguing doesn't solve problems.

574
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,380
I was impulsive that day.

575
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,340
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,540
It's my fault.

577
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,500
I should have told you earlier.

578
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,380
You can self-reflect?

579
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,860
This doesn't seem like
the Zhuang Guodong I know.

580
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,580
Are you splitting too?

581
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,700
I wish I could split.

582
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,260
One to fight for my career in Paris,

583
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,180
and one to stay in Beijing with you.

584
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,860
You said you would figure it out.

585
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,740
I believe in you.

586
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,260
Time is precious.

587
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,740
I'll enjoy love now.

588
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,620
What if I don't love you

589
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,420
by the time you leave?

590
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,260
Then save it.

591
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,820
Love me slowly.

592
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,380
Rose, don't leave me.

593
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,260
You're so driven.

594
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,740
He's aiming high,

595
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,700
and I need to be grounded.

596
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,420
Why so rational all of a sudden?

597
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
You can't stop others from leaving.

598
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,780
So you have to become someone
they can't leave.

599
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,860
(Add a friend: I'm Big-Face Huang.)

600
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,300
You gave my QQ to your brother?

601
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,060
You haven't added him yet?

602
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,660
Why would I add him?

603
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,900
I wanted to give you guys a chance

604
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,540
to reconcile with a smile,

605
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,060
but turns out you're enemies.

606
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,340
(I am Big-Face Huang.)

607
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,020
(Warning)

608
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,180
(Delete a friend: Big-Face Huang)

609
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,740
(User ''Endlessly Life'' has added you
on QQ as a friend)

610
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,260
Finally.

611
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,260
(Sending failed, the other party
has added you to the blacklist)

612
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,380
What? You friended me

613
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,540
just to blacklist me?

614
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,540
What kind of person is this?

615
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,660
If you have the guts,
block my phone number too.

616
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,860
Why did you block my QQ?

617
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,420
Why did you friend me?

618
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,500
You did it on purpose.

619
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,100
I'm telling you.

620
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,020
My foot is now worse.

621
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,540
It hurts a lot,
and I need to go to the hospital.

622
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,620
You have to take responsibility.

623
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,220
I don't care.

624
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,380
It was because of your box,

625
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,100
so the dumbbells fell and hurt my foot.

626
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Now the consequences are serious.

627
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,980
Figure it out yourself.

628
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,700
I'm sending you my home address.

629
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,020
Deal with it.

630
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,460
You actually came.

631
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,220
You even have a crutch.

632
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,900
All set up, huh?

633
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
I have no choice.

634
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,700
My foot got worse.

635
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,780
I had to go back to the hospital.

636
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,500
Back to the hospital?

637
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,660
Do you need to change shoes?

638
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,740
No need.

639
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,460
What did they say?

640
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,380
The doctor said

641
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,500
it's the functional injury detachment

642
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
of flat connective tissues in the foot.

643
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
Didn't they say that last time?

644
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,540
It's just a lifted toenail.

645
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,100
Last time they didn't say
it was this serious.

646
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,700
It's almost hitting the bone.

647
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,500
This X-ray is also

648
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,180
from last time, right?

649
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,540
The doctor said no need for a new X-ray.

650
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,060
He can see with the naked eye it's worse.

651
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,020
What else did he say?

652
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,820
It needs rest.

653
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,100
A long time to heal.

654
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,340
Nothing else?

655
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,520
Nothing else.

656
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,700
Then follow the doctor's advice.

657
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,540
Rest well.

658
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,020
Bye.

659
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,100
Leaving already?

660
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,020
What else?

661
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,340
You come to visit a patient

662
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,260
empty-handed

663
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,640
and leave in less than five minutes.

664
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,980
Even condolences don't go this fast.

665
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,620
Should I bow three times to you
at the door?

666
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,980
Can you handle that?

667
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,420
I'm still alive.

668
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,060
Why would you bow to me?

669
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,660
The doctor told you to rest.

670
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,580
No need for my fake concern.

671
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,060
People say muscle and bone injuries
take a hundred days to heal.

672
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,300
Just rest.

673
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Rest?

674
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,500
Who hurt me?

675
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,740
Wasn't it your leaking box

676
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,860
that caused my foot injury?

677
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,620
Alright, alright.

678
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,540
I'll go back and cook
a black chicken for you,

679
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,060
give you postpartum care.

680
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,500
What do you mean by that?

681
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,260
You...

682
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,380
Don't be so dramatic.

683
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,780
I thought it was a big deal.

684
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,820
Try getting hurt yourself.

685
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,420
You didn't get hurt anyway.

686
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,300
Didn't you say

687
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,460
your feet

688
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
are the best part of you?

689
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,300
It wasn't me who said that.

690
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,620
It was my mom.

691
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,020
Okay, I believe you.

692
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,860
Then I'll list the nail polish

693
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,780
I don't like online
and give you a discount.

694
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,700
Why are you selling nail polish?

695
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,420
To make you pretty.

696
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,460
You mean I should wear nail polish?

697
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Don't go. Who wants your nail polish?

698
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,380
I...

699
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,900
I'm not done with you.

700
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,980
(We recommend a transportation method
with stable humidity.)

701
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,100
(1 new message)

702
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,020
(From Mom: Son, QQ video.
I need to ask you something.)

703
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,700
(Video connecting)

704
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,580
Hi.

705
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,220
Hello.

706
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,300
When are you coming to Paris?

707
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,540
I'll have a driver pick you up.

708
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,940
I haven't decided yet.

709
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,100
Haven't decided?

710
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,860
Have you found a place to stay?

711
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,740
No, I haven't.

712
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,980
What are you thinking about?

713
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,340
It's such a good opportunity,

714
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,460
and you're dawdling.

715
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,220
I still need to hand over
my current project.

716
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,380
I'm thinking of asking the HQ
to delay my start date.

717
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,180
Are you still in a relationship?

718
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,740
That girl from last time?

719
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,380
Yes, I am.

720
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,980
Her name is Huang Yimei.

721
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,860
Is she the reason
you're not coming to Paris?

722
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,580
It has nothing to do with her.

723
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,020
She didn't say I couldn't go.

724
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,420
I warned you before.

725
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,540
If you play with fire, you'll get burned.

726
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,100
I already told you.

727
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,460
I'm not playing.

728
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm serious about this.

729
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,420
If you were this serious
about your career,

730
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,620
you'd already be in Paris.

731
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,100
I will go to Paris.

732
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,540
I just need some time.

733
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,700
You really are your father's son.

734
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,380
What does this have to do with my dad?

735
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,220
This opportunity

736
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,180
decides your next five to ten years.

737
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,820
But you're focused on a fleeting romance.

738
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,300
You've seen the European
art collection scene.

739
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,340
How can you be so short-sighted?

740
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,180
Yes, I'm short-sighted.

741
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,300
My dad's a failure,
and you're not emotional.

742
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,500
So your child

743
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,300
can't be both successful
and affectionate?

744
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,220
Is that it?

745
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,700
Your future is up to you.

746
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,220
Any external interference
can be overcome.

747
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,580
But if it's internal,

748
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,460
no one can help you.

749
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,580
(Su, incoming call)

750
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,420
(Call ended)

751
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,520
How rude.

752
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,860
(Su, incoming call, call ended)

753
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,580
Why the rush?

754
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,220
Don't you know I'm not mobile?

755
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,860
Change your shoes yourself.

756
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,460
What's with your post?

757
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,060
What do you mean by "the seller maliciously
concealed product defects"?

758
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,060
That's nonsense. Delete the post.

759
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,500
I'm telling the truth.

760
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,620
Your box wasn't sturdy.

761
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,580
The dumbbells fell out

762
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,420
and hit my foot, didn't it?

763
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,500
Did I sell you the dumbbells
or packaging?

764
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,380
Do you work out with the packaging?

765
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,220
Isn't the packaging part of the product?

766
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,580
Isn't the packaging
part of the merchandise?

767
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,620
Did you read a bootleg
"Xinhua Dictionary"

768
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,660
as a kid?

769
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,060
Do you even know what a defect is?

770
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,260
A defect is a flaw.

771
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,660
For example, you have two eyes,

772
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,140
but you can't see
the product description.

773
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,980
That's a physiological defect.

774
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,340
Any normal person knows they need

775
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,420
to support a heavy item with their hand.

776
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,700
You had no common sense
and injured yourself.

777
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,220
That's a cognitive defect.

778
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,300
I took you to the hospital

779
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,140
and rented you

780
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,780
a wheelchair.

781
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,020
And you're still here complaining

782
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,100
and being petty.

783
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,700
That's a personality defect.

784
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,980
I gave you a bad review.

785
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,500
If you're unhappy, you can appeal.

786
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,180
What are you doing?

787
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,540
Taking advantage of my injury

788
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,700
to intimidate me?

789
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,220
Are you recording this?

790
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,660
I have an MP3 too.

791
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,180
I can record it for you.

792
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,980
Let me tell you.

793
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,180
If you use violence,
I'll call the police.

794
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,700
Do you like me?

795
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,580
Then stop with this cliché

796
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,660
enemies-to-lovers drama, okay?

797
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,180
We're adults.

798
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,220
Arguing and tattling like school kids

799
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,940
is immature.

800
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,020
I'm immature? Fine, I'm immature.

801
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,980
Both times I hurt this foot.

802
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,340
Isn't that a coincidence?

803
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,740
Isn't that a coincidence?

804
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,140
What do you mean?

805
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,620
Nothing to do with you.

806
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
My foot's injured.

807
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,140
It must be fate

808
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,740
to have my foot injured again.
