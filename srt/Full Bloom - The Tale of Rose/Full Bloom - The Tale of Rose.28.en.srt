=Episode 28=

3
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,580
Let's talk.

4
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,510
It's late. I'm tired.

5
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,740
(Divorce)

6
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,380
(Divorce Petition)

7
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,860
(Plaintiff: Huang Yimei)

8
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,340
(Room 301, Unit 1, Building 10,
Yuhua Qiancheng, Xuhui District, Shanghai)

9
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,620
(Divorce Petition)

10
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,940
(Defendant: Fang Xiewen)
Based on the facts confirmed during the trial,

11
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,180
this court finds

12
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,990
the plaintiff and defendant
had a decent foundation for marriage

13
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
and have developed an amount
of affection post-marriage.

14
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,060
Although the relationship soured

15
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,430
due to trivial matters of life,

16
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,180
(Chief Judge, Judge)
as long as both parties enhance communication

17
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,780
and mutual respect,

18
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,310
reconciliation is possible.

19
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,310
Given the defendant's refusal to divorce

20
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,180
and the insufficient grounds
presented by the plaintiff,

21
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,990
the court does not support

22
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,060
the plaintiff's request for divorce.

23
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,500
Generally, the judge will deny

24
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,830
the first divorce petition

25
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,620
to preserve the marriage.

26
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,500
However, don't be discouraged.

27
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,180
If you still want to divorce in six months,

28
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,110
you can file again.

29
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,060
Okay, thank you, Lawyer Wang.

30
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,390
- I'll take my leave then.
- Bye-bye.

31
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,230
Bye-bye.

32
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,110
Let me take you home.

33
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,620
No need. I can go back myself.

34
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,060
Let's go.

35
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,500
Really, no need.

36
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,660
This outcome was expected.

37
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,620
It's okay.

38
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,270
I'll file again in six months.

39
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,030
Do you want me to try talking to him?

40
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,300
No, I can handle it myself.

41
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,110
Do you need money?

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,140
I don't need it.

43
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,590
Don't be stubborn.

44
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,540
He sold the company to Tianlangxing.

45
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,980
I didn't ask for how much.

46
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,980
He bought a new car

47
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,750
and mentioned buying another villa

48
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,300
as a dowry for Taichu.

49
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,730
But I really hate

50
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,070
how much he loves money.

51
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,980
I'm translating

52
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
for the previous publishing house.

53
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,470
I have income.

54
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,300
No matter what happens,

55
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,300
don't hide it from us.

56
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,780
Taichu, Taichu.

57
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,030
I have to work now.

58
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,150
Do you want to help me?

59
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,110
Sure.

60
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,710
Open that book and turn to Page 37.

61
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,820
This one.

62
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,260
That's right.

63
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,030
Thank you.

64
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,260
Here.

65
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,870
Everyone,

66
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,740
that's enough.

67
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,620
You can stop now. Thank you.

68
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Zhou.

69
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,460
Is the layoff list confirmed?

70
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,300
We've talked to most in our department.

71
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,460
Initially, everyone felt bad,

72
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,070
but with the N+3 severance package

73
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,030
and recommendation letters,

74
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,070
they eventually accepted.

75
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,940
Understood.

76
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,110
Fang,

77
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,710
I'll leave now.

78
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,950
Here, Mr. Fang.

79
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,660
- A toast to you.
- Here.

80
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,220
Hope we can work well together.

81
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,350
Here.

82
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,100
Mr. Fang, let me introduce you

83
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,750
to our core team members at Tianlangxing.

84
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Please, this way.

85
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,260
Come here.

86
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,110
Let me introduce you.

87
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,220
This is Mr. Fang,

88
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,710
who we will be collaborating with closely.

89
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,300
From now on, we are family.

90
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,630
Everyone, let's toast to Mr. Fang.

91
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,830
Thank you, everyone.

92
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,190
Cheers.

93
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,030
Cheers to Mr. Fang.

94
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,260
Mr. Fang,

95
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,470
I'm Xiao Xiaoyu,

96
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,950
newly joined Tianlangxing this year.

97
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,030
Nice to meet you.

98
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
Alright.

99
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,100
Everyone, please have a seat.

100
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,590
Tonight, no one leaves sober.

101
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,500
Drink more.

102
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,590
- To Mr. Fang.
- Alright.

103
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,070
- Have a seat.
- Enjoy yourselves.

104
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,060
- Come.
- Mr. Fang, please.

105
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,940
Alright.

106
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,940
Bottoms up.

107
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
Why did you drink so much?

108
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,510
I'm happy.

109
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,350
Sit down.

110
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,110
Sit.

111
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,630
Do you know how much my company sold for?

112
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,230
Huang Yimei,

113
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,030
you still look down on me.

114
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,350
Have you always thought

115
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
I'm not good enough for you?

116
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,300
Let me tell you.

117
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,390
The money I've earned these years.

118
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,500
You,

119
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,470
your brother,

120
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,710
your whole family,

121
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,150
couldn't earn it in a lifetime.

122
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,870
You still look down on me.

123
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,580
You don't take me seriously.

124
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,540
It's fine.

125
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,510
Do you really think without you,

126
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,940
I can't find another woman?

127
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,940
There are plenty of women

128
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,780
who throw themselves at me.

129
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
They'd try so hard.

130
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
They say

131
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,110
I'm young and promising.

132
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,150
They say I...

133
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,740
(Shanghai Emergency)

134
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,900
Taichu,

135
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,230
Daddy's awake.

136
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,180
Daddy, what happened?

137
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,230
I'm fine.

138
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,830
Don't be scared.

139
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,310
Taichu,

140
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,230
Daddy just woke up.

141
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,580
Let him sleep a bit more, okay?

142
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,700
Daddy feels unwell.

143
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,540
What happened to me?

144
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,260
Alcohol poisoning.

145
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,740
(Emergency)

146
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,820
Why did you bring me to the hospital?

147
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,420
If I died,

148
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,900
you'd be free.

149
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,870
What a great opportunity.

150
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,030
I never thought of it that way.

151
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,990
But you want to leave me.

152
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,990
Divorce

153
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,710
is the same

154
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,540
as being widowed.

155
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,780
Even if you're no longer my husband,

156
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,660
you're still family to me,

157
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,350
and Taichu's father.

158
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,300
Take care of yourself.

159
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,390
Don't drink so much.

160
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,030
The child was worried and cried just now.

161
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,310
Sorry.

162
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,750
Do you hate me?

163
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,540
Never.

164
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,230
I also hope

165
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,990
you won't make it too hard on yourself

166
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
because you hate me.

167
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,030
I hope

168
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,900
Taichu will grow up and...

169
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,270
You're a good father.

170
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Once I'm out of the hospital,

171
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,870
let's go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

172
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,660
(Gatherings and separations
are predestined and emotional)

173
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,620
(Divorce Certificate)

174
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,830
(Taichu,)

175
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,060
(Fang Xiewen)
(the first time you heard the word "divorce",)

176
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,420
(you were just four years old.)

177
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,100
(Divorce Certificate)
(Many advised me not to let you)

178
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,300
(understand the adult world too soon,)

179
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,430
- (but I chose to be honest with you.)
- Mommy, I want to take this.

180
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,900
(I hope you'll accept life's changes with me.)

181
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,390
(Different people)

182
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,700
(have different understandings of this word.)

183
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,700
(To me, divorce)

184
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,940
(is just the end of a relationship,)

185
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,350
(not a life failure.)

186
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,900
(Our lives)

187
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
(Domestic Departures)
(are just brief glimpses into this world.)

188
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,300
(Everything has an end,)

189
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,780
- Let me give you a hug.
- (which makes us cherish the present more.)

190
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,030
(My dear daughter,)

191
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,420
(don't be afraid.)

192
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,510
(All goodbyes happen)

193
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,030
(because)

194
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,900
(we once met.)

195
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,020
I will miss you.

196
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,420
Thank you.

197
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,470
Let's go.

198
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,740
Safe travels.

199
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,420
They're back.

200
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,780
Grandma!

201
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
Taichu.

202
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,660
Here she is.

203
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,910
Taichu, Taichu.

204
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,110

It definitely has potential in the future.

229
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,820
And it's within my budget as well.

230
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,270
It's worth considering.

231
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,300
If it's a commercial exhibition hall,

232
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,710
it really is quite good.

233
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,030
Do you have any other ideas?

234
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,620
Since we're opening in Beijing,

235
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,340
shouldn't we have some local flavor?

236
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,180
For example?

237
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,750
Hutongs.

238
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,620
They're bustling yet peaceful,

239
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,380
with a sense of tranquility and wisdom
hidden within the city.

240
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,340
Or,

241
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,180
suburbs.

242
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,510
Might the suburbs be too far?

243
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,230
Right at the foot of Mount Xishan.

244
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,710
We could rent a place and set it up ourselves.

245
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,190
Big space, highly adaptable.

246
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,670
And if the weather's good,

247
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,340
we can hold outdoor exhibitions.

248
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,950
The city is right in front,

249
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,420
and there's nature too.

250
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,990
Young people love this nowadays.

251
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,070
Good.

252
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,860
Looks like you've thought a lot about this.

253
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,580
Have you decided to join me?

254
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,820
You can have my efforts and skills,

255
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,110
but if you want money...

256
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,950
How could I let you pay?

257
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,540
I want your mind.

258
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,910
So, you decide.

259
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,990
Do you want equity or a salary?

260
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,110
It's up to you.

261
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,830
As long as you dare to ask,

262
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,110
I dare to give.

263
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,270
I haven't worked in years.

264
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,110
I'm quite clear

265
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,230
about my own abilities now.

266
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,340
So, I'll get started first.

267
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,990
After a month, I'll tell you what I want.

268
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,900
Okay.

269
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,060
Let's start with this proposal then.

270
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,340
Write down everything
you just said and thought.

271
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,670
Make a report
and submit it to me within a week.

272
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,670
What about the name of the art gallery?

273
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,380
"Manman".

274
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,220
Gu gave me that name.

275
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,620
That's great.

276
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,950
You've got a daughter now.

277
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,820
Your driving style must have changed.

278
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,270
Tina,

279
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,310
check your email.

280
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,660
(Notification: You have received a new email.
Please check your inbox.)

281
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,700
So fast.

282
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,030
I've been idle these past few years.

283
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,710
If I don't get moving soon, I'll suffocate.

284
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,860
Let's start right away.

285
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,430
I like that about you.

286
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,900
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

287
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,620
So aggressive.

288
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,950
Still the same style.

289
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,260
(Manman Art Gallery, Exterior Reference)

290
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,780
(Style Reference)

291
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,430
This is an architectural design firm.

292
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,100
You're just doing interior remodeling.

293
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,910
Isn't that overkill?

294
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,580
Even if it's just a locust,

295
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,540
I need your "overkill" to make it work.

296
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,860
Then I'll tell others

297
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,300
that Mr. Huang's sister is opening a gallery

298
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,300
and outsourcing the design to another company.

299
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,820
Wouldn't that tarnish your reputation?

300
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,790
Cut the act.

301
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,780
You could tell your niece

302
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,860
Beijing's top art gallery

303
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,910
is designed by her uncle.

304
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,110
Fine, fine, fine.

305
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,270
I'll take it for Taichu's sake.

306
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,540
Hurry up. Quotes, contracts.

307
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,030
You're so materialistic.

308
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,230
Finish the deal and off you go, huh?

309
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,060
Don't you care about your brother
and sister-in-law?

310
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,470
You two are doing fine, right?

311
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,380
No arguments.

312
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,230
What can happen to you?

313
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,220
Everything's calm and peaceful.

314
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,780
I have to meet a collector this afternoon.

315
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,180
Quickly.

316
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,270
Mr. Zhou.

317
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,310
Long time no see.

318
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,700
Long time indeed.

319
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,950
Back in the trenches with my brother again.

320
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,350
Yes.

321
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,580
Zhenhua takes good care of me.

322
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,340
I'll leave you to work. Bye.

323
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,140
Can I have Rose's project?

324
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,030
Don't think about it.

325
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,590
Jiamin,

326
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,030
come to my office.

327
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,750
Okay, Mr. Huang.

328
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,620
Later.

329
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,030
Thank you.

330
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,700
Slow down.

331
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,430
Be careful up there.

332
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,620
Slow down.

333
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,590
Miss Yimei.

334
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,900
You're here.

335
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,140
Miss Yimei, Mr. Huang has already told me.

336
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,380
Don't worry. I'll be here every day watching.

337
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,620
You see.

338
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,780
The dust is everywhere.

339
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,870
You don't need to come so often.

340
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,750
Flat images

341
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,540
feel different from the spatial ones.

342
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,430
I need to see it on site

343
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,510
- to get a real sense of it.
- Sure.

344
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,430
For example, this wall here.

345
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,990
When I came in just now,
I felt it was too solid.

346
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,910
Because when you come in,

347
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,100
the first thing you see is this wall.

348
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,540
It probably needs some adjustments.

349
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,550
- Okay.
- Think about it.

350
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
Alright.

351
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,110
And also here.

352
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,910
This space.

353
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,430
It's too open.

354
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,860
It might need a partition.

355
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,950
The arrangement of artworks is crucial,

356
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,100
so I think the spatial layout

357
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,430
needs to be well thought out.

358
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,060
If you have any new ideas...

359
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,160
- Like this.
- Got it.

360
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,430
Like this side here.

361
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,060
You can see through here.

362
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,100
- Okay.
- There's a sense of depth.

363
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,110
Alright.

364
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,270
Miss Yimei,

365
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,620
do you understand feng shui?

366
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,950
When I was in school,

367
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,820
there was a subject
called spatiotemporal environment.

368
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,990
There were many traditional
feng shui theories in it.

369
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,340
I don't understand feng shui,

370
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,470
but I believe in intuition.

371
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,980
Actually,

372
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,470
people's subconscious

373
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,230
receives signals from the environment.

374
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,270
I think feng shui is about how the environment

375
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,990
psychologically influences people.

376
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,270
My brother's initial design sketch

377
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,540
is very preliminary.

378
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,060
I might come up with many new ideas.

379
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,270
- I might change things a lot.
- Okay.

380
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,860
Be prepared.

381
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,060
I might be a very troublesome client.

382
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,910
No problem. I like clients with ideas.

383
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,990
Discussing with you,

384
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,380
I can also learn a lot of new things.

385
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,380
Don't flatter me

386
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,270
just because I'm your boss's sister.

387
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,710
No, I really mean it.

388
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,300
My brother is into music,

389
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,820
wearing headphones every day,
lost in his world.

390
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,710
His sensitivity is a kind of talent.

391
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,860
Some people are born with built-in antennas.

392
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,430
Shall we go to the rooftop to check it out?

393
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,270
This way.

394
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,980
Slow down.

395
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,620
Miss Yimei.

396
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,220
Look back.

397
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,900
I think

398
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,230
this street-facing corridor

399
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,060
could become a cultural and creative shop

400
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,750
or a café.

401
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,860
As an extension of our entire exhibition area,

402
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,580
you could change the theme style of the shop

403
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,820
according to different exhibitions.

404
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,940
Also,

405
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,470
I think this is quite distinctive.

406
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,270
Right here.

407
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,420
What do you think?

408
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,780
It's quite distinctive indeed,

409
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,380
but it lacks some

410
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,580
imagination for the space.

411
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,380
Did you play hide-and-seek
when you were little?

412
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,790
Yes, I did.

413
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,990
In a specific corner,

414
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,620
children can play around and have fun.

415
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,300
That space is very dynamic,

416
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,230
enabling interactions
between people and artworks.

417
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,820
I want to create an immersive exhibition

418
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,380
so that the audience who come to visit

419
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,190
can fully participate.

420
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,910
Are you suggesting designing some...

421
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,750
Rose.

422
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,110
Congratulations.

423
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,070
You got promoted again.

424
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,100
Why do I feel like

425
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
you're mocking me?

426
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,860
Mocking? Why?

427
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,540
Wasn't it because of this

428
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,780
that we parted ways back then?

429
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,310
Zhuang Guodong,

430
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,710
so many years have passed,

431
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,030
and you still don't understand me.

432
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,750
Then let me understand you.

433
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,900
Rose,

434
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,750
with just a word from you,

435
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,470
I'll stay in Beijing and not go back.

436
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,580
Give me another chance

437
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,060
to pursue you, okay?

438
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,900
Coming.

439
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,860
Happy birthday!

440
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,700
Thank you, thank you.

441
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,950
Welcome. Please come in.

442
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,510
- Welcome. Hurry.
- Come in.

443
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,620
- Come in. Come in.
- Do we need to change shoes?

444
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,590
No, it's fine.

445
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,950
We'd better change them.

446
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,430
Sure. We'll change them.

447
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,710
- Thank you, Mr. Huang.
- Here, a gift for you.

448
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,580
Thank you.

449
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,870
Here, in this cabinet.

450
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,270
Mimi, this is my mentor's wife, Ms. Su.

451
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,670
This is Mr. Huang.

452
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,030
Mr. Zhou and Yuan Zheng.

453
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,580
- Hello, hello.
- This is my girlfriend Mimi.

454
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,460
Well,

455
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,100
she's now my fiancée.

456
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Perfect match.

457
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,780
So beautiful, so pretty.

458
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,990
- Please come in.
- Come in.

459
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,580
The boss comes to celebrate
the employee's birthday

460
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,750
and brings gifts too.

461
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,870
I am honored.

462
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,270
Honored for what?

463
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,190
Work hard, and by year's end,
you'll have shares.

464
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,100
You'll be a boss then.

465
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,700
I don't believe that.

466
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,900
- What do you mean?
- Sit, sit, sit.

467
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,780
When did I promise something
and not deliver it?

468
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,860
- Sit, sit, sit.
- Make yourselves at home.

469
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,060
This house is quite nice.

470
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,860
When our parents left, they left some money.

471
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,190
When I came to Beijing for university,

472
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,580
my brother bought this house.

473
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,620
Later, he moved out, saying

474
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,750
it's for me and Mimi as our marital home.

475
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,430
Your brother is really good to you.

476
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,100
- He's nice to us.
- What's all this?

477
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,510
These are from my brother's travels
around the world.

478
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,710
Look at this, over there.

479
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,710
Where did my brother bring this?

480
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,990
Is it pure silver?

481
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,310
Take a look at this.

482
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,100
My brother brought it back from Africa.

483
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,060
Your brother is quite something.

484
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,140
He could hold an exhibition.

485
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,590
Jiaming!

486
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,430
- Jiaming!
- What happened?

487
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,430
What's wrong?

488
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,750
How did you become like this?

489
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,070
You...

490
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,910
It's nothing. I just fell down.

491
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,620
Taichu,

492
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,270
this uncle is my good friend.

493
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,820
What do we call him when we first meet?

494
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,990
Hello, Uncle. I'm Fang Taichu.

495
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,190
I'm five years old this year.

496
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,310
Hello.

497
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,430
She's a little kid, so she needs this.

498
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,620
Thank you.

499
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,790
Let me.

500
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,670
Come on. Get in.

501
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,790
Great.

502
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,750
- Quite a feast.
- Yes.

503
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,470
Braised carp, this dish.

504
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,910
This is Shandong cuisine.

505
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,030
- Her specialty dishes.
- All made by me.

506
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,070
This is

507
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,660
a gift for your birthday.

508
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,660
What is this?

509
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,750
Yes, yes, yes.

510
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,100
They seem to like sweet and sour flavors.

511
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,460
This...

512
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,670
Is this brick

513
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,380
a birthday present?

514
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,470
I didn't get a chance to tell you earlier.

515
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,100
When I was on the national highway
from Chifeng,

516
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,940
it was already dark.

517
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,510
I was in a hurry to get back,

518
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,230
and after riding only ten kilometers,

519
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,230
I ran over this brick.

520
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,350
With a crack,

521
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,300
I fell into the roadside grass with my bike.

522
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,670
Just as I fell,

523
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,580
a big truck

524
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,430
zoomed past me.

525
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,860
Before I could react,

526
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,710
it crashed into three cars

527
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,620
not far ahead.

528
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,950
If I hadn't fallen,

529
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,990
it would have been me under the wheels.

530
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,190
This thing has a spirit.

531
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,590
I'm passing it on to you.

532
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,220
Good stuff.

533
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,620
Thank you, Jiaming.

534
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,860
Surviving a disaster brings great fortune.

535
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
This gift is precious.

536
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,670
- Happy birthday.
- Cheers.

537
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,830
Happy birthday.

538
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,710
Thank you, Jiaming. Thank you, boss.

539
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,710
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, everyone.

540
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,350
- Cheers.
- Dear, happy birthday.

541
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,940
Enjoy yourselves.

542
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,060
Let's start to eat.

543
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,670
Mommy, look, that tower is white.

544
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,910
That's the White Pagoda.

545
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,140
Grandma took you there once.

546
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,540
She taught you a nursery rhyme, remember?

547
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,580
At Chaotian Temple, big words we write,

548
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,340
Beyond it stands the White Pagoda, bright.

549
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,190
The White Pagoda wears a red robe rich,

550
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,190
Beyond it lies the Mashi Bridge.

551
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,460
Why did you stop?

552
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,910
I forgot.

553
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,990
My dad mentioned you a few days ago.

554
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,580
He said to invite you home for dinner.

555
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,750
I thought it'd be just the two of us today,

556
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,190
so I booked a French restaurant.

557
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,950
It takes over two hours to eat there.

558
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,430
Can the little one sit still?

559
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,860
Taichu, what do you want to eat?

560
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,110
Pizza.

561
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,750
I want to eat hamburgers.

562
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,140
Paper.

563
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,100
Rock, paper, scissors.

564
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,860
I win! Let's have hamburgers.

565
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,190
How about I buy you

566
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,110
strawberry ice cream?

567
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,660
Okay.

568
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,510
Turn right at the intersection ahead.

569
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,870
Sure.

570
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,350
Su.

571
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,780
Why don't you change your brother's plate?

572
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,950
That brick just now...

573
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,470
When it comes to gifts,

574
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,190
Rose can't come.

575
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,390
She asked me to give you this.

576
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,870
More gifts to come?

577
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,390
This was painted by Miss Yimei?

578
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,660
Excellent.

579
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,910
It looks exactly like me.

580
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,830
Who's Miss Yimei?

581
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,540
Who's Miss Yimei?

582
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,990
Mr. Huang's sister.

583
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,910
My current client.

584
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,790
The first time I met her,

585
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,350
I thought a big celebrity

586
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,310
had come to our construction site.

587
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,030
She's beautiful, easy-going,

588
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,180
knowledgeable, cultured, and refined.

589
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,740
You're blinded by beauty.

590
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,870
You better stay away from this beauty.

591
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,900
What are you saying?

592
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,180
Any interesting stories?

593
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,580
You should ask Mr. Zhou about that.

594
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,940
Can we talk about it?

595
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,140
- Tell us, tell us.
- Go ahead.

596
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,230
Listen up.

597
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,540
Back then, Zhou was head over heels for her.

598
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,390
He and his bride
were at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

599
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,140
The stamp was almost on,

600
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
but he suddenly woke up

601
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,100
and called off the wedding on the spot.

602
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,870
He got beaten up by the bride's friends.

603
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,660
Even I and Mr. Huang got hit.

604
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,790
Really?

605
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,100
Everyone's life

606
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,830
needs a few moments of madness, right?

607
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,740
Let's get mad then. Let's get mad.

608
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,180
Mad, mad. Let's go mad.

609
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,390
- Mad, mad.
- Let's go mad.

610
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,620
If he dares to call off the wedding,

611
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
I'll sort him out for you.

612
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,470
You better behave.

613
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
That's impossible.

614
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,990
Miss Yimei has a boyfriend now.

615
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,150
Who?

616
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,270
Don't you know?

617
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,260
Last time at the construction site,

618
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
a tall, handsome guy

619
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,390
came to see her.

620
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,620
Well-dressed too.

621
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,510
Their relationship seems unusual.

622
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,780
Zhuang Guodong?

623
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,940
Is he back?

624
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,100
Your girl here

625
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,430
is quite the charmer.

626
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,260
If I have the chance,

627
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,750
I'd like to meet her.

628
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,580
Her art gallery is opening in a couple of days.

629
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,990
Send an invitation to your brother.

630
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,420
Sure.

631
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,350
I want to eat this.

632
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,180
- Eat this? Okay.
- And this too.

633
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,190
Here, let me help you.

634
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,740
Sure, then I want to eat this.

635
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,580
Uncle, there's a little bear inside mine.

636
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,430
What's inside yours?

637
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,660
Mommy's is a rabbit.

638
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,980
I'll take a look.

639
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,180
It's a little lion.

640
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,380
Uncle,

641
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,540
I want to taste your fries.

642
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,020
Sure.

643
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,390
Thank you, Uncle.

644
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,310
Let me treat you to milk.

645
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,980
I can have it myself.

646
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,540
Thank you.

647
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,830
Uncle,

648
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,740
since you're so tall, do you like milk too?

649
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,140
I drink it every day.

650
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,350
Can I grow as tall as you?

651
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,630
Yes, you can.

652
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,950
Do you think

653
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,910
this meal is longer than French cuisine?

654
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,350
I'll go to the restroom.

655
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,510
Uncle, what did you say?

656
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,270
I didn't say anything.

657
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,470
Uncle, what's your name then?

658
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,950
My name is Zhuang Guodong.

659
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,030
Does that mean putting jelly inside?

660
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,630
Jelly.

661
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,950
Putting jelly inside.

662
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,580
Jelly. Jelly.

663
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,910
Guodong. It means pillar of the nation.

664
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,710
Why are you laughing?

665
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,700
You're laughing so happily.

666
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,620
Uncle is called "Putting Jelly Inside".

667
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,310
Uncle Jelly.

668
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,140
He is called Zhuang Guodong.

669
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,190
Guodong.

670
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,510
- Not jelly.
- Jelly.

671
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,510
Jelly.

672
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,790
Uncle Jelly.

673
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,790
Jelly. Jelly.

674
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,990
Jelly.

675
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,700
I'm really not good at dealing with children.

676
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,020
I can tell.

677
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,420
I know.

678
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,580
You're trying to dissuade me.

679
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,910
But it doesn't matter.

680
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,830
I can slowly learn how to take care of kids.

681
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,830
I can't lose you again.

682
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,580
Haven't you been doing well

683
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,950
without me?

684
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,710
All these years,

685
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,030
there's been a hole

686
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,420
inside me,

687
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,380
deep and deep.

688
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,470
Only I know about it.

689
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,510
Not all regrets need to be made up for.

690
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,580
I just want to look forward.

691
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,190
Thank you

692
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,220

Let me introduce you.

697

- You look slimmer.
- Mr. Wang.

698
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,430
We want to go straight to the second floor.

699

Over there.

700
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,350
- This way, please.
- Ms. Su.

701
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,030

How's the design?

707

I didn't use stairs.

708
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,620
For exhibitions,

709
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,870
we could hang some art here.

710
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,830
That'll work.

711
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,910
It's good for exhibitions here too.

712
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,220
If we made stairs directly,

713
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,660
