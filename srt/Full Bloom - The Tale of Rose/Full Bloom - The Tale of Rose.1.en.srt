(Zhou Shihui)

11
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Thank you.

12
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,930
You're welcome.

13
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
- Wedding candy.
- Thank you.

14
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,450
Wait a moment.

15
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,650
Today is July 13, 2001,

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
a special day.

17
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
The 112th IOC session

18
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,570
will be held in Moscow today.

19
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
I still remember the last time
we failed to bid for the Olympics.

20
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,050
I drank so much out of frustration.

21
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Almost got into a fight.

22
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,490
It's been eight years in a flash.

23
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,330
This time we'll make it.

24
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,610
- We will.
- Definitely.

25
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,530
Of course.

26
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,840
Our overall strength is different now.

27
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
Different.

28
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,960
They're taking a bit long.

29
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,800
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,490
Isn't it just signing and stamping?

31
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,680
Why aren't they out yet?

32
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,170
Zhou is thorough.

33
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,240
At work, he checks

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
everything he signs

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,330
multiple times

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,490
to ensure there's no legal risk.

37
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,730
Very meticulous.

38
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,490
Zhizhi has a stable job,

39
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,370
is beautiful,

40
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,430
and doesn't want betrothal gifts.

41
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
What's the risk for him?

42
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,280
They're just getting a certificate.

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,510
What's the difference between marriage
and sworn brotherhood?

44
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,840
In financial management, there is.

45
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,450
Even among siblings,

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,450
you must settle accounts clearly.

47
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,690
If they get married,

48
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,160
money goes into one pocket.

49
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,490
Think about it.

50
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,260
If they have the wedding
at a five-star hotel,

51
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,130
twenty tables will cost
at least 50,000 yuan.

52
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,440
Wedding service starts at 20,000.

53
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,650
Filming and makeup
will cost another 10,000.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,680
At work,

55
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,010
our 200-person annual meeting
has a budget of just 100,000.

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,690
And that includes a lottery.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,270
♪Come, friends♪

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,090
Why are men so realistic?

59
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,450
The annual meeting happens every year,

60
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,600
but a wedding is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,890
Not necessarily.

62
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,210
Later, we need to make him
treat us to a big meal for Zhizhi.

63
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,330
Can't let him off easy.

64
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,810
- Agree.
- I agree.

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,920
Don't let him get away with it.

66
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,650
Japanese Wagyu,

67
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,840
Australian lobster,

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,160
and French oysters.

69
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,130
Should we follow the map?

70
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,360
The girls are ruthless,
with Wagyu on the list.

71
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,810
I have a bad feeling.

72
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,090
What's wrong?

73
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,130
When I picked up Zhou today,

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,090
he was ten minutes late
coming downstairs.

75
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,160
And guess what he said to me
in the car?

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
Security,

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,520
harmony, and happiness.

78
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,130
These things added together

79
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,650
might look like love,

80
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,720
and almost equivalent to love.

81
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,040
Stop being so pretentious.

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,330
That sounds reasonable.

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
What's the problem?

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,770
That is from
"Love in the Time of Cholera".

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
Do you know the next line?

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,040
"They are not love after all."

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,810
Zhou Shihui!

88
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,650

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll beat you to death, Zhou Shihui.

90

What's happening?

91
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,690
Slow down, slow down.

92
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,250
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

93
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,210
Zhizhi, Zhizhi, Zhizhi.

94
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,650
I really can't marry you today.

96
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,440
Get up. Why?

97
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,880
- I really can't marry you.
- Yes, what's going on?

98
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,720
- What's going on?
- Ask him.

99
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
If I marry you,

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,330
I'll truly harm you.

101
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,770
I thank you for your tolerance

102
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,230
and patience over these seven years.

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,810
In short, I realized today

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,250
I've been going in circles.

105
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
You're not my destination.

106
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,440
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,840
Why didn't you figure this out earlier?

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
It took you seven years to realize

109
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,810
I'm not your destination?

110
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,010
No, you must marry me today.

111
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,620
We can divorce tomorrow if necessary.

112
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,100

Go, it won't hurt.

00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,730
You owe me!

138
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,890
Getting married is like bungee jumping.

139
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,590
You just need to grit your teeth
and close your eyes.

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,840
When you open your eyes again,

141
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,720
you'll find yourself alive.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
That feeling of surviving

143
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,280
is like living another life.

144
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,450
Isn't it worth it?

145
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,250
Do you have someone else?

146
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,490
Who's that woman?

147
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,970
Think about it.

148
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
She knows you're getting married
and still flirts with you.

149
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,090
She can't be decent.

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,250
Such women are like poisonous mushrooms.

151
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,650
You...

152
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
You have the nerve to cry?

153
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,160
Feeling wronged?

154
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,690
Such women are like poisonous mushrooms.

155
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,810
Eating them makes you delirious at best

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,170
and destroys your family at worst.

157
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,090
Do you understand?

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
Listen to me.

159
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Let's turn back now.

160
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,330
Apologize to Guan Zhizhi.

161
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,450
Maybe this can be fixed.

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm turning back.

163
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,370
It's too late.

164
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,030
A marriage without love is unethical.

165
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,740
Guan Zhizhi and I

166
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,790
can never go back.

167
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,270
Without love, could you stay together
for seven years?

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,450
Who can burn with passion for seven years

169
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,170
without turning to ashes?

170
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,910
Ordinary is real. You...

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,860
I fell in love with someone else.

172
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,150
Not marrying her

173
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,170
is being responsible to her.

174
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,700
What did I say?

175
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,170
Who is she?

176
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,150
Someone from our workplace?

177
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,490
No.

178
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

179
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,340
You didn't fall for me, did you?

180
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,270
Your sister.

181
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,600
How dare you hit on my sister?

182
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,230
How dare you covet my sister?

183
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,760
I'll kill you!

184
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,530
- Don't! Stop hitting.
- How dare you hit on my sister?

185
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,880
How dare you covet her?

186
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,290
Okay, stop hitting me. I'm serious.

187
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,370
How dare you covet her?

188
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,720
I'll kill you!

189
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,880
You shameless toad.

190
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,890
You think you can get a swan?

191
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,560
I'll kill you.

192
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,400
My face...

193
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,940
Good job.

194
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,100
Catch me if you can.

195
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,330
Sure. Come on.

196
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,730
Nice.

197
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,610
Awesome.

198
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,910
Cool!

199
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
Nice.

200
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,210
Great job.

201
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,970
Awesome.

202
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,940
Well done.

203
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,400
Cool.

204
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,030
Impressive.

205
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,840
Follow up, everyone.

206
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,680
Keep up.

207
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
Get out of the car.

208
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,730
I...

209
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,330
I treated you like a brother,

210
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,200
and you're coveting my sister?

211
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,060
It's not just coveting.

212
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,310
I genuinely like her.

213
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,960
I love her.

214
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,220
You're married!

215
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,580
I repeat.

216
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,910
I'm not married.

217
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,220
So disgusting.

218
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,520
Wipe yourself.

219
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
Explain yourself.

220
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,220
What exactly happened?

221
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
I...

222
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,820
Over here.

223
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,540
(Three months ago)

224
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400

Ms. Li, let me introduce you.

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
This is my sister, Huang Yimei.

239
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,860
- Hello.
- She's here to intern with us.

240
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,190
Everyone, listen up.

241
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,170
This is my sister, Huang Yimei.

242
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,090
Starting today,

243
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,320
she'll be interning with us.

244
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,680
But let's be professional.

245
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
Treat her like anyone else.

246
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,940
Don't be too nice to her.

247
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,250
Hello, everyone.

248
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,510
Where's Zhou Shihui?

249
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,590
Zhou Shihui?

250
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,600
Shihui,

251
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,740
my sister will be under your guidance.

252
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,650
She studies art history
and doesn't know architecture.

253
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,580
But she's smart.

254
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,680
Learn from Mr. Zhou.

255
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,270
He's the best in our department.

256
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,890
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

257
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,900
Teach her everything you know, okay?

258
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,910
This is your workstation.

259
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,390
Let's get to work.

260
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,290
Alright.

261
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,630
Before me

262
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,150
was a whole new world.

263
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,030
Before meeting Huang Yimei,

264
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,670
I didn't know

265
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,390
there were rainbows

266
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,820
and butterflies in the world.

267
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,910
If love

268
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,170
is throwing a stone

269
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,510
into a calm lake,

270
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,310
making ripples,

271
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,790
she is a...

272
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,390
Deep-water bomb?

273
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
Yes.

274
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,510
That's what it feels like.

275
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,310
A big bang.

276
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,390
Waves surging

277
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,940
and heart pounding.

278
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Yimei,

279
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,820
here's a drink.

280
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,100
Thanks, Xiaoying.

281
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,290
Thank you.

282
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,170
You translated the materials so quickly.

283
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,680
- You're welcome.
- You go ahead.

284
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,850
Let's check.

285
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,960
I've never seen a girl

286
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,550
- as beautiful as her.
- Mr. Zhou.

287
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,790
Look at this.

288
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,640
Shouldn't the cycle be six months,

289
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,550
not six weeks?

290
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,720
- Did you get it wrong?
- Yes, yes.

291
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,310
I made a mistake.

292
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,670
Thanks to you.

293
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,430
Since meeting Huang Yimei,

294
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,790
I discovered my true self.

295
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,130
Let me see what a brain

296
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,940
kicked by a donkey looks like.

297
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,770
I overestimated you

298
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,790
and underestimated my sister.

299
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,200
She's beautiful
and has a good personality,

300
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,340
so she's always been surrounded by boys.

301
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,270
Some give gifts, some write love letters,

302
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,130
others get jealous and fight.

303
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,600
My parents are so often called to school

304
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,060
that they are used to it.

305
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,960
But those were just kids.

306
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,940
You're different, Zhou Shihui.

307
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,550
I can't control myself.

308
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,130
I trusted you to mentor her

309
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,980
because you're usually stable,

310
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,530
clear-headed,

311
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,790
and have a fiancée
you were about to marry.

312
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,390
You're the most disciplined
in our company.

313
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,290
With his shifty eyes,
Yuan Zheng was unreliable.

314
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,890
But you,

315
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,210
looking so honest,

316
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,960
turn out to be unfaithful.

317
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,340
I didn't cheat.

318
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,670
I'm not married.

319
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,220
I'm free.

320
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,680
And I won't marry anyone

321
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,580
but Huang Yimei.

322
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,490
Where's the dinner tonight?

323
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,940
- Duck King.
- Duck King?

324
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
Who's paying, us or them?

325
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,860
They are, of course.

326
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,800
Is this a place for rollerblading?

327
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,190
Take off your shoes and walk properly.

328
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,180
Come to my place after work.

329
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,580
It's a waste not to skate
on such smooth ground.

330
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Catch me if you can.

331
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Why are you laughing?

332
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,430
Thinking of ducks makes me happy.

333
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,150
That's gross.

334
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,210
I'm telling you.

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,170
You're just attracted to a younger woman.

336
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,090
Your brain's overproducing dopamine,

337
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,630
making you lose your mind.

338
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,790
This primitive courtship urge

339
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,720
is whitewashed as love

340
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,370
by poets and writers.

341
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,630
But it's nothing.

342
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,430
It's your fantasy, understand?

343
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,040
No.

344
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,150
I'm not alone.

345
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,650
I can feel her response.

346
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,490
What response?

347
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,100
I believe

348
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,330
she likes me.

349
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,650
What makes you believe that?

350
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,910
We ate together, had coffee,

351
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,090
and watched movies.

352
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,410
Master, hurry up!

353
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,560
Turns out I don't really like work.

354
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,670
Turns out I'm a laid-back person.

355
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,530
Turns out walking in the rain

356
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,940
is so fun

357
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
- and so poetic.
- Enjoy.

358
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
Thank you.

359
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,790
Have a cup of coffee.

360
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,490
Thanks.

361
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,770
Thanks.

362
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,730
This place is so beautiful, so charming.

363
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,670
How did you find it?

364
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,640
Rose,

365
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,020
today...

366
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,830
I like you.

367
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,150
So beautiful.

368
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,390
Let me put it on for you.

369
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,870
It's lovely.

370
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,150
But Mr. Zhou,

371
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,700
I heard you're getting married.

372
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,290
See?

373
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,780
She clearly rejected you.

374
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,810
No.

375
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,910
She's telling me

376
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,090
I have no right to be with her

377
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,780
until I end my other relationship.

378
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,870
So I decided right then

379
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,220
to break up with Guan Zhizhi,

380
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,430
and then rightfully confess to her.

381
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,080
Come on. Alright.

382
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,010
Enough about that.

383
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,320
Come on. Sit down.

384
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,160
Let me ask you.

385
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,600
Why did you wait until you were
at the Civil Affairs Bureau

386
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,500
to tell Guan Zhizhi?

387
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,780
Every time Zhizhi

388
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,080
excitedly talked to me

389
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,430
about wedding preparations,

390
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,200
I didn't know how to say it.

391
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Zhou,

392
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,920
when you said that just now,

393
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,670
was there a part of you
that couldn't let go of Guan Zhizhi?

394
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm telling you.

395
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,680
You're just having a momentary lapse.

396
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,530
Listen to me. Let's go back now.

397
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,600
- I'm telling you.
- No, no.

398
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,590
- Now, you...
- No, no, no.

399
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,200
Only after meeting Huang Yimei
did I realize

400
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,740
all my previous choices were wrong.

401
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,670
Have you heard this saying?

402
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,800
The more choices you have,
the more traps there are.

403
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,540
Do you know what examiners fear most?

404
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,700
Not choosing the wrong answer,

405
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,400
but changing the correct answer
to the wrong one

406
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,390
before handing in the paper.

407
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,490
When you realize
you've lost your true love,

408
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,640
you'll regret it forever.

409
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,200
My true love is Huang Yimei.

410
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,880
If I miss her, I'll regret it for life.

411
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
Zhou Shihui,

412
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,190
if I were Guan Zhizhi,

413
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,290
I'd give you a choice today.

414
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,730
You can either die or get married.

415
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,210
Get disabled at least.

416
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,830
No, Zhenhua.

417
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,780
Don't get in my car.

418
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,910
Pick it up and throw it in the trash can.

419
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,370
Close the door.

420
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,870
Throwing water again, huh?

421
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,980
Slow down. I just threw water.

422
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,290
Look how fast this girl is skating.

423
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,390
Be careful.

424
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,430
I'm back.

425
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,260
Mom, such a big bear.

426
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,840
That boy just now insisted

427
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,260
on leaving it here.

428
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,260
Let me, let me, let me.

429
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,370
Let me, let me.

430
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,110
Hey, who are you looking for?

431
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,150
Huang Yimei?

432
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,540
She's not here.

433
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,150
Who are you then?

434
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,390
These flowers are from you?

435
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,590
Allergic to pollen.

436
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,500
Young man, don't send flowers anymore.

437
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,970
Huang Yimei is allergic to pollen.

438
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,670
Yes, our whole family
is allergic to pollen.

439
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,370
It's hereditary.

440
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,770
A cake?

441
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,190
Don't send cakes either.

442
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,390
Huang Yimei is on a diet.

443
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,500
Yes, she's still dieting next month.

444
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,430
How did you two meet?

445
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,350
Who am I?

446
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,070
I'm her dad.

447
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,390
Latin dance class?

448
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,130
Enough with the chitchat.

449
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,490
Besides your studies,

450
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,010
you're not lacking in anything.

451
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,640
It hasn't affected my studies either.

452
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,150
I'm still getting scholarships, right?

453
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,460
Your little cleverness

454
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,880
won't be enough
for the postgraduate entrance exam.

455
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,430
Mom, I need to change.

456
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,120
You're 22.

457
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,730
If you want to have a relationship,
be serious.

458
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,810
We're not stopping you.

459
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,210
You can't keep doing this.

460
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,010
Running around all day,

461
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,360
messing around with boys.

462
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,640
What's messing around?

463
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,770
They're all just regular friends, Mom.

464
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,430
Look at all the girls in this compound,
none are like you.

465
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,600
The phone at home
rings incessantly all day.

466
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,630
Singing under the building
late at night with candles lit.

467
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,940
Is that proper?

468
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,590
Didn't you tell me to be united
and friendly with classmates?

469
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,780
Why are you only friendly
with boys?

470
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,560
If you don't like them,
make it clear early on.

471
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,630
Set boundaries.

472
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,530
In this day and age,
why talk about setting boundaries?

473
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,260
Girls should respect themselves.

474
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,570
Why should girls be asked
to respect themselves?

475
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,200
Why doesn't anyone ask men
to respect themselves?

476
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,010
They're like flies,
buzzing around incessantly.

477
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,850
Can't shoo them away.

478
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,050
I can't control others.

479
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,350
I can only control you.

480
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
Think about it.

481
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,450
So many boys come to you.

482
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,290
Why?

483
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,190
Because I'm good-looking,

484
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,240
like you.

485
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,330
You're glib,

486
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,170
like your dad.

487
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,070
Your mom isn't stopping you
from having a relationship,

488
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,910
but there should be a limit

489
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,190
about regular friends.

490
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
Like this bear.

491
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,920
It's not cheap, right?

492
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,440
Is it appropriate

493
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,940
to accept such an expensive gift

494
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,160
for no reason?

495
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,460
Give it back.

496
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,000
Dad,

497
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,150
don't you think this bear
looks just like my brother?

498
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,300
Like your brother?

499
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,290
This girl.

500
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,200
Good for you.

501
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,770
- Stop drinking like this.
- Stop drinking like this.

502
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,940
Slow down, slow down.

503
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,500
Let go, let go.

504
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,780
What's wrong with you guys?

505
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,400
What are you afraid of?

506
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,600
I won't jump off a building,

507
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,300
nor will I cut my wrists, okay?

508
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,430
I just didn't get married.

509
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,050
I'm so good like this.

510
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,910
Being single.

511
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,540
It's better than getting married
and then divorcing.

512
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,670
Hey, Dad.

513
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,350
Let me tell you something,

514
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,220
I didn't get the certificate
with Zhou Shihui.

515
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,050
He died.

516
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,570
He was hit by a car.

517
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,220
I just came from the morgue.

518
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,290
Don't worry. I'll mourn properly.

519
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,540
That's it then, bye-bye.

520
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,870
Hey, Auntie.

521
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,700
Help me cancel the wedding banquet.

522
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,940
Zhou Shihui died.

523
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,880
Yes, fortunately in misfortune,

524
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,590
he died before the wedding.

525
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,400
Okay, that's it then.

526
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
Bye-bye.

527
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,070
- Zhizhi.
- Alright, alright.

528
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,980
He's dead. Let it go.

529
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,440
Toronto.

530
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,190
Beijing. Beijing.

531
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,810
Beijing.

532
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,680
Istanbul.

533
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
Hello?

534
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,330
It's me.

535
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,630
Come downstairs in five minutes.
I have something to ask you.

536
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,870
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

537
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,020
Why is it you again?

538
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,150
Why are you all so annoying?

539
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,020
Flowers again?

540
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,020
Don't you have anything new?

541
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,600
Come on. She didn't accept
your flowers last time.

542
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,050
Do you think
she'll accept them this time?

543
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,260
Take the flowers away now.

544
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,440
You leave too.

545
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,810
Well...

546
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,720
Are you leaving or not?

547
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,500
- Are you leaving or not?
- I'm leaving, leaving.

548
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,830
Like a fly.

549
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,330
You caused such a big mess,

550
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,670
yet you're still eating a popsicle?

551
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,400
What's wrong?

552
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,460
For you, Zhou Shihui

553
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,230
did get the marriage certificate
at the Civil Affairs Bureau today.

554
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,300
Is that so?

555
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,540
What's it got to do with me?

556
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,940
You know he has a fiancée, right?

557
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,120
Why don't you
keep your distance from him?

558
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,260
Then you go ask him.

559
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,530
He has a fiancée.

560
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,740
Why come and flirt with me?

561
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,250
He's being silly,
but you can't instigate that.

562
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,810
Can't you see what look he gives you?

563
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,500
Can I control what look he gives me?

564
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,290
Okay, okay.

565
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,530
I'm telling you. No matter what,

566
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,050
you're not allowed
to go to work these two days.

567
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,010
If you're not in front of him,

568
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,840
maybe I can persuade him
to change his mind.

569
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,190
His fiancée still wants him?

570
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,940
Why shouldn't she want him?

571
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,250
They've been together for seven years.

572
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,220
Why can't she give a chance
to someone who wants to change?

573
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,970
Clothes can be replaced,
but people can't.

574
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,020
Do you understand?

575
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,670
You men treat relationships like clothes.

576
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,970
Once they're old, you discard them.

577
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,800
Women also treat relationships
like clothes,

578
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,290
new for three years, old for three years,

579
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,870
and patched up
for another three years, right?

580
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,590
Let me tell you, I look down

581
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,850
on women like that.

582
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,980
Rose, no matter what,

583
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,840
you're not allowed
to see Zhou Shihui again.

584
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,680
Do you understand?

585
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,210
I'm going to work,

586
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,860
not to see him.

587
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,210
You're not allowed to go to work either.

588
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,350
- Work for what?
- Why?

589
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,400
Why?

590
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,250
Because Zhou Shihui broke his engagement.

591
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,680
Why? Because it will

592
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,600
become explosive news at work tomorrow.

593
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,690
Because I'm a leader in the department.

594
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,530
Because...

595
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,460
Did we win the Olympic bid?

596
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,530
The live broadcast is at 10 pm.

597
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,210
♪The five-star flag flying in my hand♪

598
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,540
♪Songs of victory are heard all around♪

599
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,500
He was my first love.

600
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,110
We've been together for seven years.

601
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,700
I never thought he'd treat me like this.

602
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,770
Mr.and Mrs. Huang,
I really don't understand.

603
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,680
I really don't understand.

604
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,640
Miss, here, have some water.

605
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,110
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

606
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,190
Quick, watch the live broadcast.

607
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,720
Zhizhi?

608
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,290
Why are you here?

609
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,330
Zhenhua,

610
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,220
tell me. Does Shihui have another woman?

611
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,980
Who is she? Tell me.

612
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,200
Zhizhi, I swear on my integrity.

613
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,330
There's no one else, really.

614
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,500
Don't lie to me.

615
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,330
You're his best friend

616
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,490
and his superior.

617
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,560
You must know.

618
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,010
- But I don't...
- Please, I beg you.

619
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,920
Tell me.

620
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,300
Who is that woman?

621
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,190
There isn't, truly.

622
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
Rose, don't you want
to watch the live broadcast?

623
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,090
Go back to your room now.

624
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,360
Go back inside. Go.

625
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,260
Wait a moment.

626
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,330
Rose?

627
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,460
Is your name Rose?

628
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,460
You're Zhou Shihui's intern, right?

629
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,400
I always thought Rose
was calling for flowers.

630
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,780
It turns out it's calling for a person.

631
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,160
It's you, isn't it?

632
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,530
You seduced my husband, right?

633
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,840
- It's you, right?
- Zhizhi, calm down.

634
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,290
- It's you, isn't it?
- Calm down.

635
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,160
It's you, right?

636
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,000
Calm down, calm down.

637
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,450
Right? How can I calm down?

638
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,450
Shihui was calling her name
in his dreams.

639
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,070
What's going on, Huang Yimei?

640
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,840
How would I know?

641
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
I didn't stop them from getting married.

642
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,210
What did you do?

643
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,490
I didn't do anything.

644
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,390
If you didn't do anything,

645
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,970
why would she come here
and cry like that?

646
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,050
Tell me honestly.

647
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,800
What's going on with that man?

648
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,830
What did you do?

649
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,010
We just went out for meals and coffee.

650
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,800
Just meals and coffee.

651
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,740
Was it just you two?

652
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,290
Isn't that a date?

653
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,150
And you say you didn't do anything?

654
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,400
Can't friends go out

655
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,020
for meals and coffee?

656
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,080
I didn't know what you liked to drink,

657
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,670
so I ordered one of each.

658
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,920
Thank you.

659
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,000
You're welcome.

660
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,590
Which one do you want?

661
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,050
Well,

662
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,050
anyone is okay.

663
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,130
Thank you, Master.

664
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,130
You're welcome.

665
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,600
Having coffee with him alone
is already crossing the line,

666
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,840
yet you went out for dinner!
It was dinner!

667
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,150
Just once.

668
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,530
Thank you.

669
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,330
This place is so beautiful and romantic.

670
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,260
How did you find it?

671
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,680
Look how beautiful the sunset is,

672
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,540
like in a movie.

673
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,670
Even more beautiful than a movie.

674
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,120
Doesn't it look like
"The English Patient"?

675
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,460
The sunset in the desert.

676
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,870
I haven't seen it.

677
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,050
Then you must watch it.

678
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,880
"The English Patient"
is my favorite movie,

679
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,720
really good.

680
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,260
Do you want to go watch a movie?

681
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,920
Is it Mrs. Zhou?

682
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,290
No, no, we're not married.

683
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,190
Your girlfriend.

684
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,870
Hurry, pick it up.
I'm not eavesdropping.

685
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,480
Okay.

686
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,160
Hello?

687
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,680
I'm having dinner with colleagues.

688
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,520
Let's talk later.

689
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,500
Is Mrs. Zhou urging you to go home?

690
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,540
No, no, there's nothing.

691
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,530
Enjoy your meal.

692
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,920
Rose,

693
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,770
today...

694
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,500
I like you.

695
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,190
Mr. Zhou, this won't do.

696
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,680
And today's meal should've been my treat.

697
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,300
I heard you're getting married.

698
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
Congratulations.

699
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,670
Did you go to the movies?

700
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
No, no.

701
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,630
No? But he told me...

702
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,360
No, no. They didn't.

703
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,500
How do you know he didn't?

704
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,050
What's wrong?

705
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,560
How did you know?

706
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,020
Did you join their date?

707
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,910
Didn't you know he was getting married?

708
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,210
But you went out with him.

709
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,840
You had dates, had coffee

710
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,260
and dinner.

711
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,010
Dare you say you didn't
have any feelings for him?

712
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,850
I didn't.

713
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,400
He kept asking you out time and again.

714
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,770
If it's not you seducing him,
then what is it?

715
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,480
He's so much older.

716
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,800
If I seduced him,
I must have lost my mind.

717
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,970
Alright, go back to your room.

718
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,300
He's older?

719
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,840
He's a year younger than your brother!

720
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,340
- Miss, listen to me.
- Miss.

721
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,720
- This might not be what you think.
- He's older?

722
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,370
Calm down.

723
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,600
Mr. and Mrs. Huang, did you see that?

724
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,770
- It wasn't me.
- I'm not stupid.

725
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,050
Hurry, hurry.

726
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,890
Are you crazy?

727
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,570
You're the crazy one!

728
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,540
Alright, alright.

729
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,090
Mr. and Mrs. Huang,
you heard everything, right?

730
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,290
I'm not being unreasonable, am I?

731
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,400
We're getting married,

732
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,640
yet she went out with him

733
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
for dates and coffee.

734
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,290
I just want to ask.

735
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,940
Was it like this in your generation too?

736
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,880
Miss, you can't say that.

737
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,490
Is this how

738
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,300
you teach your daughter?

739
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,880
- No, Zhizhi.
- You're both university professors.

740
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,810
My parents are old.

741
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,650
They have heart problems.

742
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,380
- Is this how they teach their daughter?
- Do this for me, okay?

743
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,420
Let's go downstairs and talk, okay?

744
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,330
For you?

745
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,280
Why should I do it for you?

746
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,760
- Huang Zhenhua!
- Alright, hurry.

747
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,090
Your whole family is the same.

748
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,090
Come, sit down.

749
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,950
This child.

750
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,550
Let me tell you. This isn't over.

751
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,770
Huang Zhenhua,

752
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,450
I thought you'd be fair to me.

753
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,970
I didn't expect you
to be of the same ilk.

754
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,420
I am being fair.

755
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,380
Think about it.

756
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,600
Plenty of handsome, well-educated men
are chasing after my sister.

757
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,050
How could she
be interested in Zhou Shihui?

758
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,320
What do you mean?

759
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,970
Are you saying
I picked up someone unwanted?

760
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,160
That's not what I meant.

761
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,010
Then what do you mean?

762
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,640
Let me tell you.
It's not my sister who caused this.

763
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Zhou Shihui, which part of your story

764
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,670
with my sister is true?

765
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,800
We'll talk face to face.

766
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,820
This isn't over between us.

767
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,050
Do you have any shame?

768
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,780
She came to our house!

769
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,600
I told you earlier.

770
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,720
Stop messing around with those men.

771
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,820
But you wouldn't listen.

772
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,930
Why don't you ever believe me?

773
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:52,850
No matter what,

774
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,280
you blame everything on me, right?

775
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,050
- You...
- As far as I'm concerned,

776
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,970
it's not all Yimei's fault in this.

777
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,970
- You...
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

778
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,330
Calm down, calm down.

779
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,050
Listen to me. Starting from tomorrow,

780
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,970
I won't let her work
in the Architectural Institute.

781
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,930
- I'll fire her.
- Why?

782
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,010
He harassed me.

783
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,590
You don't fire him, but you fire me?

784
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,240
What are you blinking your eyes for?

785
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,680
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- Nothing wrong.

786
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,670
Don't help her.

787
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,450
This is all your fault.

788
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,160
If she hadn't interned with you,

789
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,700
she wouldn't be so bold.

790
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,560
Huang Yimei,

791
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,320
I've overlooked your past childishness,

792
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,640
but this is a moral issue.

793
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,160
You're breaking up
someone else's family,

794
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,240
causing them to divorce.

795
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,280
Mom, they're not married yet.
It's not a divorce.

796
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,190
Shut up.

797
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,600
From today on, you're not allowed
to go to the institute.

798
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,760
You're not even allowed out the door.

799
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,450
You stay at home quietly

800
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,450
and reflect on yourself.

801
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,160
No matter what I say,
you don't believe me, right?

802
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,890
You believe whatever others say.

803
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,240
Fine, I seduced him.

804
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,760
I seduced him.

805
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,700
- I seduced him!
- Rose,

806
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,010
you can't say such things lightly.

807
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,150
I didn't say it lightly.

808
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,640
You're convicting me.

809
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,630
Whatever the crime is,

810
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,380
I committed it, okay?

811
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,780
Isn't it seducing a married man?

812
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,560
I didn't just seduce him.

813
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,970
I even slept with him.

814
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,810
That's enough.

815
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,070
Mom, let me out.

816
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,370
Why are you locking me up?

817
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,850
If I don't discipline you today,

818
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,510
you'll commit a big mistake
sooner or later.

819
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,970
I'm locking you up now.

820
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,550
If you keep causing trouble,
the police will lock you up.

821
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,450
Do you know you're illegally imprisoning me?

822
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,820
Mom, you're breaking the law.

823
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,420
Dad, say something, Dad.

824
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,860
Dad, Dad!

825
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,280
You've really upset your mom.

826
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,490
I can't help you anymore.

827
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,080
Just ease up a bit.

828
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,740
I haven't even used the toilet yet.

829
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,260
Hold it in.

830
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,690
Stop looking.

831
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,890
Zhizhi.

832
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,890
Zhizhi.

833
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,070
Why are you here?

834
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,110
Looking for Shihui?

835
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,590
He's not here today.

836
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,780
How did your conversation go yesterday?

837
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,600
I'm not here for him,

838
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,630
I'm here for you.

839
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,110
Huang Zhenhua, she's your sister,

840
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,640
so you're covering up for her, protecting her.

841
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,630
I can understand.

842
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,740
Zhizhi, I admit I'm responsible for this.

843
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,490
Initially, I brought her

844
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,490
to intern at the institute,

845
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,160
and I also arranged for Zhou

846
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,240
to provide guidance to Rose at work.

847
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,490
But it was because I knew

848
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,150
you two had been in love
for so many years

849
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,090
and I knew
you were getting married this year

850
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,160
that I felt at ease
letting my sister be with him.

851
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,340
Who knew he'd have ulterior motives?

852
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,080
No, no.

853
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,080
I promise.

854
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,010
My sister has no intention
of competing with you,

855
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,530
because she doesn't
fancy Zhou Shihui at all.

856
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,420
Then why didn't she clearly reject him?

857
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,530
Didn't she tell you yesterday?

858
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,530
She rejected him.

859
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,810
Your sister's name is Huang Yimei, right?

860
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,950
Yes, her nickname is Rose.

861
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:22,970
Rose.

862
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,540
A student from
the Central Academy of Fine Arts,

863
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,210
not yet graduated.

864
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,860
Yes. Why?

865
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,230
What if the school leaders

866
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,340
and teachers find out

867
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,410
she's being a homewrecker and tried

868
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,810
to seduce someone else's boyfriend?

869
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,490
No, it's a fiancé.

870
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,300
How do you think
the school will handle her?

871
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,410
This could ruin her future.

872
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,260
- She...
- Have you thought about how it could ruin me?

873
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,340
Weren't you asking who hurt me?

874
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,810
If you hadn't told us,
I'd have thought it was a cat.

875
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,860
What a big cat.

876
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,090
Zhou Shihui doesn't deserve her anyway.

877
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,930
Exactly.

878
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,150
You're better than him.

879
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,670
Based on looks alone,
I could outshine Zhou by miles.

880
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,320
If it weren't for
Huang Zhenhua's interference,

881
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,830
I would have confessed
to Huang Yimei long ago.

882
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,930
Zhou Shihui's cunning.

883
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,850
He beat me to it.

884
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,690
Indeed.

885
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,810
Better you than him.

886
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,850
You're single at least.

887
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,030
- That's true.
- Exactly.

888
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,470
Zhou really messed up this time.

889
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,110
He didn't get married

890
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,510
and is too scared to come to work now.

891
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,690
Indeed.

892
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,890
That little fox.

893
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,600
I could tell from the first day.

894
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,680
Her big eyes are so flirtatious.

895
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,630
She could flirt with a mop handle.

896
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,280
Zhou Shihui

897
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,820
is already engaged.

898
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,900
She should've kept her distance.

899
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,220
Ms. Li, I beg to differ.

900
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,680
Why should she keep her distance?

901
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,990
Just because she's pretty?

902
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,950
If I were that pretty,

903
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,420
I wouldn't care what others would say.

904
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,330
You...

905
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,080
Stop gossiping. Go back to work.

906
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,920
Let's go.

907
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,780
Why hasn't she come out?

908
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,380
She can come out if she wants.

909
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,330
Rose?

910
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,810
Rose?

911
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,260
Your mom already unlocked the door.

912
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,740
Come out and eat.

913
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,850
She's locked herself in.

914
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,760
Not eating at all.

915
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,220
Missing a few meals won't kill her.

916
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,110
Stop spoiling her.

917
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,490
Alright, alright.

918
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,950
What do you want?

919
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
Get up.

920
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,030
She ran away.

Morning.

You're here.

940
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,110
Want a cup of Colombian coffee?

941

Thanks.

942
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,650
It's brewing.

943
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,560
Look at my face.

944
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,550
I was there during the chaos yesterday.

945
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,860
All scratched up by Zhou's fiancée.

946
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,070
She's fierce.

947
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,010
Zhou isn't decent.

948
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,070
How can he covet you?

949
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,700
Doesn't he know his own age?

950
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,300
You two must have at least ten years
between you, right?

951
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,670
I think we're about the same age.

952
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,440
Where's my brother?

953
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,310
He's busy.

954
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,170
Busy with what?

955
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,030
A client came.

956
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,080
Having a meeting.

957
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,820
Let's talk. Don't disturb them.

958
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,210
Mr. Yuan,

959
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,340
you know your eyes dart to the right

960
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,030
when you lie, right?

961
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,720
No.

962
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,240
The root of the problem is Zhou Shihui.

963
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,690
The root of the problem is you,
Huang Zhenhua.

964
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,930
You haven't understood, have you?

965
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,410
No, even if I didn't arrange

966
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,800
for Zhou Shihui to guide my sister,

967
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,730
there would still be others.

968
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,200
Zhou Shihui would still see her working here.

969
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,240
If you didn't place your sister

970
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
next to Zhou Shihui,

971
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
there wouldn't be anyone else.

972
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,640
He's been working for you
for so many years.

973
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,670
Has he ever had someone else?

974
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,630
Isn't it all because of you?

975
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,240
So what you're saying is

976
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,850
it's because my sister is pretty.

977
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,320
My sister's beauty is natural,

978
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,530
given by God.

979
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,890
She dared to come here, huh?

980
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,850
No, you...

981
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,930
She's pretty indeed.

982
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,510
I want everyone to see how pretty she is.

983
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,410
- What is my brother busy with?
- Why are you pulling me?

984
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,010
- He's not busy, just meeting a client.
- Let go of me.

985
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,930
He's in a meeting.

986
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,260
Let's not disturb them, okay?

987
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,400
Huang Yimei.

988
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,460
Yimei,

989
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,620
you really shouldn't go up there.

990
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,860
