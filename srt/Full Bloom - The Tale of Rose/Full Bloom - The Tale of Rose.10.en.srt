4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,170
My foot's injured.

5
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,340
It must be fate

6
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,930
to have my foot injured again.

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,270
Okay, I took it out on you.

8
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm sorry. I'll delete the post now.

Alright.

12
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,580
How is

13
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,510
your foot?

14
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,090
It's actually much better now.

15
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,010
Just seeing you makes me limp
subconsciously.

16
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,760
You've been standing for a while.

17
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,980
Why don't you sit on the couch for a bit?

18
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,100
I'll get you a bottle of soda.

19
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,910
Thank you.

20
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
Never mind.

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
Girls shouldn't drink cold stuff.

How about I make you a cup of tea?

Okay.

Why are you so happy?

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,170
Have you been wanting to get rid of me?

37
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,860
When you think of me,

38
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,370
I want you

Doctor,

56
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,390
it's the same foot as last time.

57
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,480
It got hit by dumbbells.

58
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
This time,
it got scalded by hot water.

59
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,580
Is this foot badly injured?

60
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,350
You still had your sock.

61
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,580
It's not scalding hot water,
so it's not serious.

62
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,550
With a minor injury,

63
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,000
do you need your family
to push the wheelchair?

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,700
- She...
- I'm the boss. It's work-related.

65
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,650
The wheelchair is for return.

66
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,530
Alright, go get the medicine.

67
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,530
Are you sure it's okay?

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Once you said it's okay,

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,210
it actually doesn't hurt as much.

70
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,610
Seems like it's fine.

71
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,340
- Thanks, doctor.
- Thank you.

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,020
Could you please tell us how much it is?

73
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,040
- Let me pay.
- No need, no need.

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,550
I burned myself. I'll pay.

75
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,710
You got hit by my dumbbells first.

76
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,410
If we go further back,
it's Newton's fault for discovering gravity.

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,190
- How much is it?
- How much? I'll pay.

78
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,320
You two,

79
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,240
stop it.

80
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,120
This can all be reimbursed
with medical insurance.

81
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,090
No need for this.

82
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,580
Fifty-two in total.

83
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,970
Fifty-two, right?

84
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,110
I got it.

85
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,290
Where's my phone?

86
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,410
Can't find your phone?

87
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,170
Maybe it got left at your place
before we left.

88
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,450
Do you like me?

89
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,210
Did you intentionally leave your phone
at my place

90
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,290
so you could come back again?

91
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,090
This plot is a bit cliché, isn't it?

92
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,360
Hurry up, there's a queue behind.

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
Sorry about that.

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
Hello?

95
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,570
Rose?

96
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Hello?

97
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
Rose.

98
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Have you arrived?

99
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,650
I just got off the plane.

100
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,870
Rose,

101
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
I miss you.

102
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,140
I miss you too.

103
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,460
I haven't slept a minute

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,260
during the ten-hour flight.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,090
You were all I could think about.

106
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,670
Rose,

107
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,530
I really can't be without you.

108
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,940
I regret it.

109
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,340
I regretted it from the moment
I boarded the plane.

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,730
The farther away from you,
the more afraid I am.

111
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,850
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

112
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,990
I have an answer now

113
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,970
to the question you asked me.

114
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,820
What question?

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,170
If it was after I met you,

116
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,940
I wouldn't have
submitted that application.

117
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,970
I would never leave you.

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,140
How's the weather in Paris?

119
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,990
It's raining.

120
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,170
It's raining in Beijing too.

121
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,970
I hate the rain.

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,460
But when it rains, I miss you even more.

123
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,460
Then I like the rain.

124
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,950
Come in.

125
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,060
Hi, you must be Eric.

126
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,420
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

127
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,820
What's your name?

128
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
My name is Issa.

129
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,760
Let me help you.

130
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,320
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

131
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,250
You can put it here.

132
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,040
Welcome.

133
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,460
Let me introduce the house for you.

134
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Here

135
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,780
is your table.

136
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
You can do your homework here.

137
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,250
- Okay.
- And this is the bathroom.

138
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,580
And this is my room.

139
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,060
Where's my room?

140
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,360
Sorry.

141
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,420
This is your room.

142
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,890
And here's the kitchen.

143
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,960
We can cook together.

144
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,780
And you can use it as you want.

145
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,160
As you want.

146
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,840
I can do some Chinese food for you.

147
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
Really?

148
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,070
I love to eat hot pot. It's spicy.

149
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,040
Delicious.

150
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,780
Really? I want to try it.

151
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,880
Okay.

152
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,540
Look at the window.

153
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,010
The view is very nice
and beautiful actually.

154
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,350
It's nice. Good view.

155
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,540
Do you need any help?

156
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,110
No, thanks.

157
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,820
Okay. If you need help, I'm here.

158
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,540
- Okay.
- Welcome.

159
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,060

Can you hear me?

205
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,240
I can hear you.

206
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,890
Have you settled in?

207
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,400
Yes, all settled.

208
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,970
Let me show you.

209
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,190
Look.

210
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,540
Here is the bathroom.

211
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,110
This is my roommate's room.

212
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,060
Take a look at mine.

213
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,950
No, this cable is too short.

214
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,540
I'll take a photo
and email it to you later.

215
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,830
Hold on.

216
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,430
How is it?

217
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,950
Looks good.

218
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,310
What did you say?

219
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
Looks good.

220
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,940
As you said,

221
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,230
don't get angry,

222
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,070
but do keep alive.

223
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,990
It's been 72 hours

224
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,970
and 34 minutes since I last hugged you.

225
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,890
Missing me so much?

226
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,240
Don't worry.

227
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,490
As soon as I have time off,
I'll come back.

228
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,180
How's work?

229
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,090
Most of my colleagues are from Europe.

230
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,910
I joined the team last.

231
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,070
I'm not very familiar with them yet,

232
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,490
and there's a lot to learn.

233
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,180
It's a bit challenging.

234
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,090
Don't overwork yourself.

235
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,910
Don't worry.

236
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,710
Hello?

237
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,640
I said don't worry.

238
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,480

239
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,910
Hello?

240
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,010
It's starting to lag.

241
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
Hello?

242
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,090
Hello, can you hear me?

243
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,580
How about I call you back later, okay?

244
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,660
I need to prepare
for tomorrow's meeting.

245
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,000
One more kiss.

246
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
Bye-bye.

(Three-limbed Big-Faced Huang Exercising)

248
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,610
Stay safe.

249
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,210
(Endless Life)
Incorrect methods will disable the three limbs.

250
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,850
What does that mean?

251
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,730
Reminding me or mocking me?

252
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,700
I humbly ask for exercise advice.

253
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,850
Always warm up before exercising.

254
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
Start fast and return slowly.

255
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,890
Avoid relying on momentum.

256
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,820
Pause for two seconds
when muscles contract.

257
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,340
Start fast and return slowly.

258
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,850
Start fast.

259
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,820
Return slowly.

260
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,150
Start fast.

261
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,890
Return slowly.

262
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,540
Start fast.

263
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,890
One, two.

264
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,920
Miss, could you introduce yourself?

265
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,760
Of course.

266
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,930
I'm Amanda, thank you.

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,850

of the avant-garde art exhibition,

275
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,830
could you please introduce

277

The theme of our exhibition
is "No U-turn".

You can see all our exhibits

279
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,200
and these simple installations
from the start

280
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,360
have transported us
to another time and space,

281
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,120

for self-realization,

- art exhibition this time?
- It's all pretty good.

300
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,640
- Yeah, it's all pretty good.
- I think it's really good.

301
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,440
Really good.

302
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,850

303
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,780

304
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,130

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,680
So, I want to thank every Cyan member

307
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,920
and the staff for your efforts
in this exhibition.

308
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,840
Thank you all.

309
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,850
Especially Huang Yimei.

310
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,310

311

Congratulations, Yimei.

312
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,440
Huang Yimei recently joined Cyan.

313
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,880
This is her first time curating,

314
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,640
and I think she did an outstanding job,

315
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,820
beyond my expectations.

316
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,600
Especially her efforts
to bring in fashion media,

317
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,680
online forums, and other new media

318
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,510
resulted in excellent publicity for us.

319
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,440
Congratulations, Yimei.

320
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,370

321
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,610

322
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,220
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

323
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,300
At the end of the 19th century...

324
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,820
- Sorry.
- Okay.

325
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,310
Hello?

326
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,060
Are you busy?

327
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
I'm in training.

328
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,200
Is something wrong?

329
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,780
No, nothing serious.

330
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,730
You should get back to work.

331
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,790
Glad you're okay.

332
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,260
I'll call you back later.

333

Eric,

334
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,980
do you want
to grab a drink with me tonight?

335
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
Thank you for offering,

336
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,790
but I...

337
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,170
And with Paul Russo.

338
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,200
The Italian guy you mentioned before?

339
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,040
Exactly.

340
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,960
The Italian guy who works

341
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,580
for the Italian National Museum.

342
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,020
You know he can be very helpful.

343
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,020
Okay, let's go.

344
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,150
Alright.

345
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,650
My girlfriend, Rose.

346
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,930
Her Chinese name is Huang Yimei.

347
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,750
She looks exactly like a cutie

348
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,600
in a Japanese anime.

349
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,440
Really?

350
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,980
She's so pretty and adorable.

351
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,850
But she looks very young.
Is she a minor?

352
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,820
I'll call the police for that.

353
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,600
- She's 22.
- Okay.

354
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,740
But thanks. I'll tell her your concern.

355
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,060
I'm sure she'll take it as a compliment.

356
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,550
Okay.

357
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,890
Then let's make a toast.

358
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,820
- Hello, everyone.
- Here.

359
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

360
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,880

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,960
Sorry.

377
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,740
What are your plans for the future?

378
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,500
In that regard,

379
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,080
considering we have contacts
in Shanghai now...

380
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,920
Hello?

381
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,890
Hello? Are you outside?

382
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,750
Working late tonight.

383
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,130
I just finished work.
I'm about to head home.

384
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,890
You're working so hard.

385
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,680
Then

386
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,930
hurry back and rest.

387
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,160
I can rest tomorrow.

388
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,060
Shall we video chat?

(Three-limbed Big-Faced Huang Exercising)

392
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,410
Coach, what should I practice today?

393
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,780
Back. Bend over with knees slightly bent,

394
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,370
hold dumbbells vertically
in front of the body,

395
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,750
use the contraction force
of the latissimus dorsi

396
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,930
to pull the dumbbells to shoulder height,

397
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,170
hold for five seconds,

398
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,410
and slowly return.

399
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,170
Where is the latissimus dorsi?

400
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,740
(Dialogue mode)

401
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,440
Like this?

402
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,110
Or

403
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,350
like this?

404
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,680
Or?

405
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,980
You've been teaching me
via QQ for so long.

406
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,130
When will you teach me face to face?

407
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,990
How much does
a private training session cost?

00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420

410

That's his son's tuition.

411
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,450
His son is not my son.

412
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,880
What responsibility do I have
if his son can't afford school?

413
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,500
Alright, alright, stop talking.

414
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,930
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

(Three-limbed Big-Faced Huang Exercising)

416

Five.

418
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,780

(Dialogue mode, Endless Life)

420
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,450
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have made that joke.

421
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,500
Treat me to a meal.

422
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,020
Only for tonight.

423
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,010
Drinking alone?

424
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,500
Thirsty.

425
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,900
Thirsty?

426
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,070
Other people
quench their thirst with H2O.

427
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,400
You're impressive, drinking C2H6O.

428
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,800
You're good at chemistry.

429
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,880
That's because of

430
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,240
the slogan we used to chant in school.

431
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,390
"Master math, physics, and chemistry,

432
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,540
and you'll fear nothing in the world."

433
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,740
I still remember trigonometric formulas.

434
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,750
Why did you wear this outfit?

435
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,720
Didn't you say it's only for tonight?

436
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,300
I was in a hurry and didn't change.

437
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,010
Plus, what if you need to give me
some last-minute instructions?

438
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,490
This is convenient.

439
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,610
Have you heard of the term

440
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,090
"fat skinny person"?

441
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,130
What does

442
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,280
"fat skinny person" mean?

443
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,540
It means looking thin

444
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,780
but being plump.

445
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,020
You do need to work out.

446
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,060
Isn't that the purpose of my coming here?

447
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,260
Coach, should I

448
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,170
pay the tuition first?

449
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's order.

450
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,680
Waitress, we need to order.

451
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,520
Sure.

452
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,310
Here.

453
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,070
Here.

454
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,350
Order then.

455
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,220
You do it since you're paying tuition.

456
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,450
No, I pay tuition, so you should do it.

457
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,680
Don't save money for me.

458
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,920
Here.

459
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,650
Bottom up again?

460
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,090
You're quite good at drinking.

461
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,060
You've stayed in Beijing
after graduating from college?

462
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,110
Yes.

463
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,020
Living in Beijing as a girl
isn't easy, right?

464
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,150
I'm good.

465
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,120
Asking questions beyond private coaching

466
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,340
costs more than this meal.

467
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,410
- Bring another bottle.
- Wait a moment.

468
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,370
Don't open it. I have to work tomorrow.

469
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,980
I'm not stingy with money.

470
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,120
How about taking one home?

471
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,060
We'll drink it tomorrow.

472
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,790
Open it.

473
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,890
- Open it.
- Alright.

474
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,600
Just like Rose,

475
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,990
you're assertive
and don't listen to advice.

476
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,580
No wonder my sister likes you.

477
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,470
This meat has been marinated for so long
and it's still delicious.

478
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,700
It means the meat's of good quality.

479
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,030
Eat more then.

480
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,130
You can always run a few more laps.

481
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,090
Should I eat or not?

482
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,930
Eat.

483
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,260
You need to eat well
to have energy for exercising.

484
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,890
I'll listen to you.

485
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,340
Thank you then.

486
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,160
Hello? Can you hear me?

487
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,610
- Yes, I can.
- Good afternoon.

488
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,740
Oh, good evening.

489
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,340
You called me yesterday.

490
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,450
What did you want to say?

491
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,120
The avant-garde art exhibition
ended yesterday.

492
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,060
Tina praised me
at the celebration dinner.

493
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,650
Congratulations! Tina praised you?

494
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,090
You were in Shanghai last night?

495
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,410
As I told you,
I was in Shanghai all last week.

496
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,480
Right, right.

497
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,400
You told me. I forgot.

498
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,020
I've been working overtime
too much lately.

499
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,350
Come on,
you're being like this the whole day.

500
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,160
You've been yawning like this
the whole day.

501
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,830
What did you do with Naomi last night?

502
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,260
Stop saying that.

503
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,610
I'm talking with my girlfriend.

504
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,790
- Go away. Shut up.
- Hello.

505
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,890
Hello, hello.

506
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,200
Go away.

507
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,740
Who's Naomi?

508
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,360
A colleague.

509
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,590
My supervisor.

510
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,830
We were working overtime
together last night.

511
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,920
A woman?

512
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,800
A woman.

513
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,700
Are you jealous?

514
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,870
My roommate loves to joke around.

515
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,620
He's talking nonsense.
Don't take it seriously.

516
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,930
Is it a lag or are you angry?

517
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,050
Not angry.

518
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,450
But you didn't return my call yesterday

519
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,660
or say goodnight.

520
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,490
It's just this once.

521
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,970
But I'll worry about you.

522
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,820
Got it. I won't forget next time.

523
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,890
I was really too busy yesterday
and forgot.

524
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,160
I'll say goodnight to you every night

525
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,000
from now on, okay?

526
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,040
Trust me.

527
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,520
Smile.

528
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,300
Tong, are you done with work?

529
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,660
Ms. Su, if there's nothing else,
we're leaving.

530
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,040
Okay.

531
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,520
Leaving? Bye-bye.

532
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,530
Bye-bye. See you tomorrow.

533
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,780
Hello? Are you outside?

534
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,000
Working late tonight.

535
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,540
I just finished work.
I'm about to head home.

536
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,100
You're working so hard.

537
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,000
Then

538
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,260
hurry back and rest.

539
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,300
(Send email, To Eric)

540
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,140
Confirm the type of exhibition.

541
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,930
Is it a solo exhibition
by independent artists

542
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,850
or a thematic exhibition

543
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,620
for a major event,

544
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,340
such as a technology art exhibition

545
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,890
or a new media art exhibition?

546
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,340
Determine the type
based on the situation.

547
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,590
Okay.

548
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,270
Great.

549
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,400
Fine.

550
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,260
Got it.

551
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,960
Okay.

552
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,740
Goodbye, goodbye.

553
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,020
(Video chat, Video connecting)

554
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,100
Why aren't you speaking?

555
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,000
Getting sleepy?

556
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,140
I received your email.

557
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,570
Quite impressive.

558
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,740
You managed to find it.

559
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,180
Have you changed careers?

560
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,220
Have you become Sherlock Holmes?

561
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,490
Let me see. Let me see.

562
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Are you angry?

563
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,740
I just went out for a drink
with a colleague.

564
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,040
Is that not allowed?

565
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,930
Was that what you called overtime?

566
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,660
Yeah, it was overtime.

567
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,270
Who said overtime

568
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,560
means you have to sit
in front of a computer,

569
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,830
write reports, and do copywriting?

570
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,050
We're in the same industry.

571
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,820
You should know

572
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,000
that maintaining resources
and connections

573
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,450
and socializing are all part of our work.

574
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,270
We attend those receptions,
celebration dinners,

575
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,570
and social occasions.

576
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,710
Who can guarantee
there are no opposite sexes present?

577
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,600
But I didn't lie to you.

578
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,970
I didn't lie to you either.

579
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,180
If I had told you I was at a bar,

580
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,710
wouldn't you

581
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,740
be suspicious just like now?

582
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,040
I thought it would be easier
to avoid trouble,

583
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,880
so I didn't mention it.

584
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,640
So, because I'm suspicious,

585
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,390
you had to lie to me?

586
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,890
I didn't lie.

587
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,020
(Video chat)

588
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,040
Do I have to report to you every detail

589
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,960
of what I do

590
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,820
and who I meet every day?

591
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,160
Even if it's not overtime,

592
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,960
do I not have the right to have a drink?

593
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,870
Do you want to control everything
like my mom?

594
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,260
I'm not trying to control you.

595
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,930
There's a six-hour time difference
between us.

596
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,710
We have to catch each other
at the right time to talk.

597
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,430
If you're not saying anything,

598
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,830
what else is there to talk about?

599
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,050
I really don't have the energy
to argue with you.
