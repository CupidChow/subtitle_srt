=Episode 12=

3
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,400
Lulu is here too.

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,210
Go and say hi to her later.

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Okay.

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,990
Feel free.

7
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,270
Thank you.

8
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,930
Who's Lulu?

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,930
An ex-girlfriend from school.

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,540
She knows you brought your girlfriend,

11
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,060
and specifically asked you
to greet your ex-girlfriend?

12
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,190
Her parents and my mom

13
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,640
have been friends for many years.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,990
It's impolite not to greet her

15
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,520
when we run into each other
in such a setting.

16
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,310
Besides, everyone here is very relaxed.

17
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,540
There aren't so many formalities.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,850
Let me introduce you.

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,880
Mr. and Mrs. Song, long time no see.

20
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,510
- Long time no see.
- Hello, Liliana.

21
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,520
Long time no see.

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,030
This is my girlfriend, Rose,

23
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,870

Rose?

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,380
Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.

43
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,020
Hello, the number you dialed
is turned off.

44
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,350
Where are you?

45
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,580
Call me back immediately.

46
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,620
The streets in Paris are chaotic.

47
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,140
Don't wander alone.

48
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,230
Hello?

49
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,630
Alright.

50
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Okay.

51
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,810
I'm heading to the office right away.

52
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,500
(Hainan Airlines)

53
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,820
(China Customs)
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

54
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,840
The flight to New York

55
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,010
(From Zhuang Guodong: What happened?)
now begins the check-in process.

56
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,340
(Call me when you see this.)
Please take

57
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,810
(Don't wander alone.)
your luggage and tickets

58
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,340
to Counter 14
according to the instructions

59
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,620
(To Zhuang Guodong: Landed in Beijing safely.)
to complete your check-in.

60
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,190
Thank you.

61
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,490
(Pick up the phone. Why did you leave suddenly
without saying anything?)

62
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,020
(To Huang Yimei: Do you know
how worried I was?)

63
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,820
(From Zhuang Guodong: What's wrong?
Why is your phone off?)

64
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,500
(Rose, what happened?
Call me back. Are you angry again?)

65
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,620
(To Zhuang Guodong:
The company needs me urgently.)

66
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Ms. Jiang.

67
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,410
- Hello, Ms. Jiang.
- Hello, Ms. Jiang.

68
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,290
Ms. Jiang, these contracts
need your signature.

69
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,870
Leave them here.

70
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,380
Is there anything else I can do?

71
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,380
Nothing, you can go back first.

72
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
Wait.

73
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,410
Could you get me a coffee?

74
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,340
(Su)
Paris is beautiful,

75
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,460
but I don't belong here.

76
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,070
The body's back,

77
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,340
but when will the spirit be back?

78
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,750
Su,

79
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,860
have you ever had a moment

80
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,140
where suddenly

81
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,460
everything

82
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,650
became clear?

83
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,750
An epiphany.

84
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,390
Epiphanies happen in an instant,

85
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,440
but before they happen,

86
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,860
one goes through a long period

87
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,150
of struggle, conflict,

88
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,010
and self-doubt.

89
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,220
Once it happens,

90
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,500
things become different.

91
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,180
(User information)

92
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,300
(Eric: Meeting a friend from Germany today.
Won't video call for now.)

93
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,860
(Alright.)

94
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,770
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

95
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,360
(Room 6)
The situation has stabilized,

96
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
but pregnancy at this age

97
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,140
still carries some risks.

98
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,280
She should stay in the hospital
for a few days

99
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,500
for comprehensive checks.

100
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,460
- Okay.
- What's your relationship with her?

101
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,390
She's my boss.

102
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,980
If surgery is needed later,

103
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,840
we'll need a family member's signature.

104
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
Can you contact them?

105
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,840
Room 6.

106
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,220
- Over there.
- Thank you.

107
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
How did it go?

108
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,030
Did she have a miscarriage?

109
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,100
Seems not.

110
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,170
You knew?

111
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,040
Just a few days ago,

112
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,360
I saw her throwing up in the bathroom.

113
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,010
She probably realized it herself
at that moment.

114
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,390
Isn't she single?

115
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,890
Who told you she was single?

116
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,720
Right. She just didn't mention it.

117
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,190
I'll ask Amy to find

118
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,430
the emergency contact for employees

119
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,590
and get her husband's number.

120
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,430
Don't.

121
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,600
She's already filed for divorce.

122
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,080
Let her decide

123
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,260
whether to tell him or not.

124
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,170
What kind of person is her husband?

125
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,440
His surname is Gu.

126
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,340
Tina met him when she was studying
in New York.

127
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,080
He helped her

128
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,460
get into the art circle.

129
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,050
Why don't they live together?

130
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,190
Mr. Gu's company is in Hong Kong, China

131
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,960
and Tina can't let go of Beijing.

132
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,770
They've been separated for a long time.

133
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,620
Just two months ago,

134
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,320
didn't Tina go to Hong Kong, China?

135
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,670
She went to talk to Mr. Gu about divorce.

136
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,050
Probably got pregnant then.

137
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,580
Are they still divorcing?

138
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,140
Better start the procedures.

139
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,650
Why haven't you left yet?

140
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,160
I didn't misjudge you.

141
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,790
You understand me too well.

142
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,630
I was just thinking about this.

143
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,690
Does the doctor allow this?

144
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm not having the surgery tomorrow.

145
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,710
Come on.

146
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,040
Why is there just one cup?

147
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,880
Where's yours?

148
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,400
How many times have you stolen my drink?

149
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,480
Do you think I don't know?

150
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Stop pretending.

151
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,110
Hurry up.

152
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

153
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,350
Ms. Jiang,

154
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,490
is the child Mr. Gu's?

155
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,400
Of course.

156
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,450
Who else's could it be?

157
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,340
Good for you, Ms. Jiang.

158
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,110
Getting more vigorous as you age.

159
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,210
Age? What do you mean?

160
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,920
Mr. Gu.

161
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,210
Isn't he almost sixty?

162
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,540
Yes.

163
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,250
Come on.

164
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,140
How did this old ox

165
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,250
sow the seeds?

166
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,140
Ms. Jiang, I have a question.

167
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,170
How did pregnancy and divorce

168
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,380
occur simultaneously?

169
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,210
Xueqiong,

170
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,450
why did you suddenly come to Hong Kong, China?

171
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,310
You could have let me know before coming.

172
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,450
I could have picked you up.

173
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,780
Come, sit.

174
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,820
Are you hungry?

175
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,650
I can have something prepared.

176
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,280
No need.

177
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,970
Come, have some tea.

178
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,380
You should

179
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,490
sign it.

180
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,100
The lawyer has already told me about it.

181
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,250
I roughly know the contents.

182
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,410
My dear,

183
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,580
is this all you want?

184
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,020
There are still your shares
in the company.

185
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,170
You've earned them

186
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,820
over the years.

187
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,450
It's been eight years.

188
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,780
Eight long years.

189
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,380
So many beautiful memories.

190
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,300
Do you really want nothing?

191
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Don't you regret it?

192
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,340
You've given me a lot already.

193
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,890
From you,

194
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,140
I gained insight,

195
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,110
resources,

196
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,480
and love.

197
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,820
Love?

198
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,910
Love.

199
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,890
Though we still love each other,

200
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,860
we can't accompany each other anymore.

201
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,380
Then let each other be free.

202
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,100
Leaving a lover and giving up a child.

203
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,890
Won't you regret it in the future?

204
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,250
Since we've come to this point today,

205
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,300
let me say a few more words to you.

206
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,170
Gu and I

207
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,450
have actually been separated
for many years.

208
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,630
One in Hong Kong, China,

209
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,620
and the other in Beijing.

210
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,340
He refused to move to Beijing for me,

211
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,630
and I couldn't go to Hong Kong, China for him,

212
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,210
giving up everything in Beijing.

213
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,540
We've both studied art.

214
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,240
You tell me.

215
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,070
Which expresses the self more,

216
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,490
assigned work or free creation?

217
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,490
Of course, it's free creation.

218
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,830
Marriage and having children, for me,

219
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,170
are like assigned work.

220
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,170
I love him very much,

221
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,100
but I don't want to be just Mrs. Gu.

222
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,140
I want to be myself.

223
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,860
So, I choose free creation.

224
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,450
Excuse me, whom are you looking for?

225
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,760
Xueqiong.

226
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,540
Let him in.

227
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,950
Sorry.

228
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,590
Could you give us more time?

229
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,720
Just tell me if there's anything
we need to prepare.

230
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,750
Okay, the surgery is in half an hour.

231
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,580
All jewelry must be removed.

232
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,960
She hasn't eaten or drunk anything, right?

233
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,800
No.

234
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay. Half an hour.

235
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,840
Thank you.

236
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,690
Thank you.

237
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,540
Take care of her.

238
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,860
Remind her to eat on time.

239
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,650
Don't let her drink alcohol anymore.

240
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,620
No alcohol in the hospital.

241
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,820
Not everyone is lucky enough

242
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,620
to encounter true love

243
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,490
in their lifetime.

244
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,620
But I still have many things to do

245
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,100
and many paths to walk.

246
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,560
These

247
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,170
are just as important as love.

248
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,890
Didn't you ask me before

249
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,820
if I would regret it?

250
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,250
You won't regret it.

251
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,310
You have the determination
to see it through to the end,

252
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,540
and the courage to accept loss.

253
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,700
(Divorce Agreement)

254
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,950
Send this

255
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,210
to my lawyer.

256
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,820
(Divorce Agreement)

257
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,680
(Video chat)
It's been a while since we last video chatted.

258
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,560
How have you been lately?

259
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,340
Still the same.

260
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,890
Tina was hospitalized recently,

261
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,140
and she didn't assign me
any important tasks.

262
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,730
Now that there's no overtime,

263
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,210
I'm still getting used to it.

264
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,480
Not sure if there will be another chance

265
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,780
to work as a curator.

266
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,890
Do you miss me?

267
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
Yes.

268
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,620
They said I had the highest score
in this training.

269
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,100
But there's nothing to be proud of.

270
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,680
I've learned all this before.

271
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,650
In another month,

272
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,210
this management training
will be over for good.

273
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,300
Naomi has already informed me

274
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,880
that the position of Marketing Manager

275
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,310
is almost certain.

276
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,690
How's that? Good news, right?

277
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,930
Congratulations.

278
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,890
Once this job settles down,

279
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,150
after being here for five years,

280
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,540
I can apply for permanent residency.

281
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,440
Oh, my mom recently introduced me

282
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,200
to a Belgian collector

283
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,300
who seems quite interested in me.

284
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,400
I think...

285
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,450
We should break up.

286
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,590
What are you saying?

287
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,170
I'm saying we should break up.

288
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,210
What's wrong again?

289
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,870
Why are you so resistant

290
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,310
to the idea of permanent residency?

291
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,540
It's only five years.
I'm not staying here forever.

292
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,410
I'm not resistant to it.

293
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,780
I don't want to argue with you either.

294
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,890
So what do you mean
by suggesting a breakup?

295
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,140
Can't you stop being so wilful?

296
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,930
Which girl talks about breaking up
every day?

297
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,620
Huang Yimei, let me remind you.

298
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,330
If you mention it again,
I'll take it seriously.

299
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,170
This time I'm serious.

300
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,870
Fine.

301
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,060

You said you wanted to go to Paris,

318
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,820
so you took off.

319
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,390
Then I...

320
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,270
I have to go find you?

321
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,390
You missed me, so I went there,
but you wouldn't find me.

322
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,650
I'll hug her and you get the key.

323
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,150
Come on.

324
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,340
What are you doing?

325
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,720
Okay, okay, okay.

326
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,350
- Are you done?
- Can you do it?

327
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,240
Okay, okay, okay.

328
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,080
Okay, okay.

329
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,540
- Got it, got it.
- Foot, foot, foot.

330
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,310
- Be careful, careful.
- Slow down, slow down.

331
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,150
Slow down, slow down.

332
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,650
Let me tell you.

333
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,620
Come and help me.

334
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,820
I know you're uncomfortable.

335
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,280
It's okay.

336
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,300
You've arrived at my place.

337
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,720
Help me.

338
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,670
After drinking,

339
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
this is...

340
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,730
- Come on.
- Let me tell you. It's nothing.

341
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,930
Okay, okay, okay.

342
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,060
Okay, okay.

343
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,450
Okay, okay, okay.

344
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,780
It's quite expensive for you
to be heartbroken.

345
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,490
- Ordered Moutai, huh?
- Let me go find you?

346
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,890
Let me go find you?

347
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
No, why? Why should I pay?

348
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,540
I didn't bring enough money.

349
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,550
I didn't mean you.

350
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,100
When you wake up,
I'll settle the bill with you.

351
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,970
Don't fall down.

352
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,540
You go back.

353
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Then you watch her. I'll leave first.

354
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,580
Don't, don't.

355
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,910
No, no, no.

356
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,630
She needs someone to take care of her.

357
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,510
I can't drive you.

358
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,520
You don't need to.

359
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,890
It's not safe for you
to leave alone so late.

360
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,780
Is it safe here?

361
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,860
What's unsafe here? I...

362
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,280
Have a seat.

363
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,170
I'll get you a glass of water.

364
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,390
Don't get it for me.

365
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,490
Get her a glass.

366
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,890
Sit on the sofa.

367
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,790
Oh, my goodness.

368
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,820
Why is she so heavy after drinking?

369
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,390
Here.

370
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,580
Can you get up to drink some water?

371
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
I...

372
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,390
Thank you again.

373
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,230
Thank you

374
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,790
for accompanying my sister

375
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,340
during this special time.

376
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,860
It's the eighth time.

377
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,250
I find you quite interesting.

378
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,830
Usually, you seem indifferent,

379
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,730
but in crucial moments,
you're very caring.

380
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,060
Because I need
to remain vigilant at all times.

381
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,170
Being so vigilant all the time,
aren't you tired?

382
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,790
What are you being vigilant about here?

383
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,780
When you're here,

384
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,380
relax a bit.

385
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,910
No need to be vigilant.

386
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,320
Just relax.

387
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,080
This...

388
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,720
This red wine.

389
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,490
I don't often drink it,
but it's quite strong.

390
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,070
Well, it's necessary

391
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,460
to be vigilant.

392
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,590
How's Rose?

393
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,650
What a mess.

394
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,500
How's Rose doing?

395
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,480
I'm heading back first.

396
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,320
Okay, okay, okay.

397
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,460
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.

398
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,210
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

399
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,510
Then I'll leave first.

400
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,480
Go, go.

401
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,920
Let me drive you.

402
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,960
No need, no need.

403
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,900
- Really, no need.
- You...

404
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,140
Where's your coat?

405
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,320
It's at the door.

406
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,800
Do you like it?

407
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,510
Yes.

408
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,290
If we ever move,

409
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,940
we have to take this wall with us.
