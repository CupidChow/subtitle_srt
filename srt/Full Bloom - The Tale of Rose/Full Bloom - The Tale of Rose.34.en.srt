=The Tale of Rose=

2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,980
Jiaming?

4
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,390
You're back.

5
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,000
Have you seen Doctor Yao?

6
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,720
So, this is

7
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,090
like the final judgment.

8
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm so hungry.

9
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,690
Can you cook something for me?

10
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,840
I don't know how to cook.

11
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,020
It's okay.

12
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,130
Just make anything.

13
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,530
This is a limited edition.

14
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,760
Luo has always wanted it.

15
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,250
He asked me to sell it to him,

16
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,970
but I refused.

17
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,350
If I suddenly

18
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,440
give this to him,

19
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,690
will he think I'm trying to deceive him?

20
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,020
(Guitar, Luo)

21
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,500
(Leave completed and unfinished pieces to Luo.)

22
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,080
This piano has always been with me.

23
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,750
When I was a child,

24
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,560
I couldn't run around like other kids.

25
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,810
My parents scrimped and saved

26
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,000
to buy me this,

27
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,290
so I'd have something to do.

28
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,610
Others are just concubines,

29
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,310
but this one

30
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,000
is my wife.

31
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,760
I can't entrust it to anyone.

32
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,850
Give it to Jiamin.

33
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,510
Not to him.

34
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,580
Not to you either.

35
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,290
Are you afraid we'll be reminded of you?

36
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,930
No, we won't.

37
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,520
Maybe now you think

38
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,290
these things are important,

39
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,880
but someday,

40
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,080
you'll forget me

41
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,400
and move on.

42
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,370
I won't.

43
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,400
It's not about that.

44
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,050
You must do this.

45
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,750
In the future,

46
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,610
you'll fall in love many times

47
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,440
and meet many people.

48
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,750
Maybe

49
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,130
you might even marry again.

50
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,440
Fang Taichu will grow up.

51
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,520
You'll watch her grow up.

52
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,320
When she grows up,

53
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,520
you'll eat lots of hot pot together.

54
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,980
When she drinks for the first time,

55
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,050
you must tell her

56
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,000
it's dangerous for a girl to get drunk outside.

57
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,260
Do you know?

58
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,050
I feel like I can see

59
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,320
Fang Taichu growing up and arguing with you.

60
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,850
If she becomes a rebellious girl,

61
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,440
you'll have a hard time.

62
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,440
Stop this, okay?

63
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,200
I don't want to hear it.

64
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,050
As fellow patients,

65
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,490
I envy those with cancer.

66
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,080
At least they can die slowly.

67
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,690
They have a countdown.

68
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,960
During this countdown,

69
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,250
they are safe.

70
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,520
They can do whatever they want.

71
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,440
They can make a bucket list,

72
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,440
travel the world,

73
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,640
skydive, and scuba dive.

74
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,880
They can do things my heart can't handle.

75
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,580
As for me,

76
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,370
I don't even have a countdown.

77
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,130
Maybe this second

78
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,560
is my last second.

79
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,250
Maybe this is the last time

80
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,850
I look at you.

81
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,030
It's okay.

82
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,150
Hello?

83
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,210
Xiaohe.

84
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,640
Well,

85
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,210
are you busy?

86
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,370
I'm in the lab.

87
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,920
Did I disturb you?

88
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,190
It's okay.

89
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,880
Do you need anything?

90
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,130
I wanted to ask you

91
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,850
if you can have a meal together.

92
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,970
You're married, right?

93
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,210
I am married.

94
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,780
Does your spouse know

95
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,970
you're treating me to a meal?

96
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,680
Well...

97
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,850
I just wanted to ask about your son Lele.

98
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,830
He...

99
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
He...

100
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,800
Lele is the child I adopted

101
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,150
while working in Shenzhen.

102
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,830
Originally,

103
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,470
I planned to tell him

104
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,330
after he turned eighteen.

105
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,330
He's still too young now.

106
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,850
So, in front of him,

107
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,490
I can't say much.

108
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,220
Well...

109
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,980
Well...

110
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,150
I'm sorry,

111
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,300
I shouldn't have asked so many questions

112
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,280
in front of the child.

113
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,280
How could you think he's yours?

114
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,130
That's impossible.

115
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,370
Yes, it's impossible.

116
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,980
But

117
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,520
don't you think he looks so much like me?

118
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,780
Especially his eyes.

119
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,950
Both single eyelids.

120
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,470
I think even if I had my own child,

121
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,400
they wouldn't look so alike.

122
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,830
Indeed,

123
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,660
he was only one year old when I adopted him.

124
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,090
He was thin and small.

125
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,450
I didn't expect

126
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,570
he'd grow up to look like this.

127
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,100
And

128
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,970
later, I remembered that time

129
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,970
we drank at your place.

130
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,570
So I kept thinking,

131
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,270
feeling

132
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,210
something wasn't right.

133
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,640
The fish incident, right?

134
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,040
That day,

135
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,370
you indeed drank too much.

136
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,490
You fell asleep on the couch.

137
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,250
You even cried.

138
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,920
I cried?

139
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,250
You cried

140
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,130
while calling out "Su".

141
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,850
I even cried.

142
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,490
That was embarrassing.

143
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,090
I didn't do anything

144
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,610
to feel sorry for you.

145
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,130
Glad to know.

146
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,980
Glad to know.

147
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,420
(Jail)

148
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,100
Hello?

149
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,040
Gengsheng,

150
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,000
they framed your dad.

151
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,090
They're asking for 300,000.

152
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,740
They said without money,

153
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,260
they'd sue him. They'd send him to jail.

154
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,250
What did he do?

155
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,450
They say he molested a six-year-old girl.

156
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,540
How could we trust

157
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,450
a child's words?

158
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,780
It must be instigated by her parents.

159
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,590
Gengsheng, think of a solution.

160
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,680
We don't have that much money.

161
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,040
They slandered me. I didn't do it.

162
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,500
Your dad

163
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,800
is really falsely accused.

164
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,730
He's old now.

165
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,800
He doesn't do those things anymore.

166
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,680
What's wrong, Su?

167
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,280
What happened?

168
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,400
That beast

169
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,450
is still causing harm.

170
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,000
Why did she hang up?

171
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,040
Stop calling her.

172
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,680
She won't help me.

173
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,510
If she won't, who will?

174
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,090
We don't have that much money.

175
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,430
You...

176
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,070
You old thing.

177
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,950
Marrying you makes my life miserable.

178
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,870
You didn't spare even a child.

179
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,000
Why are you such a pervert?

180
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,330
Now,

181
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,900
they want us to pay

182
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,380
to ruin us.

183
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,920
What should we do now?

184
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,520
I want to divorce you.

185
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,210
You go to jail.

186
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,640
You should be shot.

187
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,800
Dinner's ready. Eat some.

188
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,490
Don't think so much.

189
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,970
I should have called the police.

190
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,520
You were just a child then.

191
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,570
Now the statute of limitations has passed.

192
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,330
Even with witnesses and evidence,

193
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,960
it's useless.

194
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,640
I need to go back to my hometown.

195
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,140
Why?

196
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,640
I want to finance the girl to sue him.

197
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,290
I'll go back with you.

198
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,090
I can go alone.

199
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,990
You always went back alone,

200
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,640
handling everything yourself.

201
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,770
It's different now. You have a husband.

202
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,920
I won't let you face this alone.

203
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,710
I don't know if I can be of help,

204
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,440
but at least I can be there for you.

205
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,670
This is my husband. This is Jie.

206
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,370
Jie, hello, please sit.

207
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,710
Mr. Huang.

208
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,640
What exactly happened?

209
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,720
Do you know that little girl?

210
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,330
She lives right across the street.

211
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,960
He often plays with her.

212
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,570
Sometimes,

213
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,830
he even

214
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,290
buys snacks for her.

215
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,530
That day, the family returned home early

216
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,290
and happened to see him

217
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,100
holding her on his lap,

218
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
with his hand reaching...

219
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,140
Enough.

220
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,680
This might not have been his first time.

221
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,010
When did this happen?

222
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,260
Last week.

223
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,230
It's been a while now.

224
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,540
Why didn't they call the police?

225
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,440
They said they want 300,000 yuan,

226
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,370
or they'll send him to prison.

227
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,330
Mom sold her jewelry.

228
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,920
They won't pursue it further?

229
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,330
They're worried about the girl's reputation.

230
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,160
She's still young.

231
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,200
Do you have that family's phone number?

232
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,710
Jie,

233
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,130
do you have a girlfriend now?

234
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,290
No.

235
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,880
You're not young anymore.

236
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,200
I can't bring a girl home

237
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,680
and introduce her to that person.

238
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,460
(No. 6, Qingyuan Street)

239
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,180
Gengsheng,

240
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,530
I saw it that day.

241
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,130
I was lying on the ground

242
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,290
and saw everything,

243
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,330
the whole process.

244
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,610
But

245
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,680
he's my real dad.

246
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,570
I'm too weak, Gengsheng.

247
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm sorry.

248
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,620
I know nothing I say matters now.

249
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,620
It's too late.

250
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,530
I didn't help you

251
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,160
and hurt others instead.

252
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,960
If only I had acted sooner...

253
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,090
I'm sorry, Gengsheng.

254
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,340
It's okay.

255
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,780
You're not to blame.

256
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,680
It's his fault.

257
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,340
He's guilty.

258
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,610
Don't cry. Don't cry.

259
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,370
I want to go in alone.

260
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,400
I need to handle this

261
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,440
myself.

262
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,380
Stay safe.

263
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,330
Call me if anything happens.

264
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,100
Go.

265
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,640
How's the child now?

266
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,440
How can she be?

267
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,050
My daughter

268
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,240
has nightmares every day,

269
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,240
scared to go out,

270
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,090
afraid to go to school.

271
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,920
Do you have evidence

272
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,950
of what he did?

273
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,790
Evidence?

274
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,290
Everyone there saw it that day.

275
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,570
Your dad is simply despicable.

276
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,340
He's a stepfather.

277
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,010
Biological or not,

278
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,880
you can't escape this.

279
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,050
And we need compensation

280
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,720
for our lost wages, too.

281
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,780
She may need counseling now.

282
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,580
I can pay

283
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,480
for a therapist.

284
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,670
What?

285
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,090
You want to get rid of us with that money?

286
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,540
I've said it before.

287
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,920
At least 300,000.

288
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,370
It's been a week.

289
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,270
I want to know

290
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,530
why you didn't call the police.

291
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,100
Would your family rather see him

292
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,130
in prison than pay?

293
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,780
I consulted a lawyer.

294
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,910
For cases like this,

295
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,530
even if you sue him,

296
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,130
you still have the right to seek compensation.

297
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,140
Do you

298
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,090
want us to sue him?

299
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,780
Don't you?

300
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,710
Don't you want to see justice done?

301
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,680
Yes, we do.

302
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,300
Do what?

303
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,130
If we sue him, everyone will know.

304
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,010
Who knows

305
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,160
what people might say?

306
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,290
Our daughter is so young.

307
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,440
How will she live with this?

308
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,480
We just want the money now

309
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,240
and then move away

310
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,810
as far as possible from that jerk.

311
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,090
So, you're running away?

312
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,530
Why are you running?

313
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,770
He's the one who did wrong.

314
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,440
How will your daughter think of this?

315
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,230
Will she think

316
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,880
it was her fault?

317
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,300
Will she blame herself

318
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,640
for wearing pretty clothes?

319
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,530
For not shouting out?

320
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,950
Will she blame herself

321
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,990
for not running away

322
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,610
and even for being a girl?

323
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,880
And in the future,

324
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,400
bit by bit, she'll close herself off

325
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,960
from friends,

326
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,920
from the crowd,

327
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,470
from everyone who tries to get close to her.

328
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,310
By then,

329
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,510
she won't feel any kindness

330
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,050
left in this world.

331
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,770
Your daughter isn't the first victim.

332
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,720
When I was a child, that animal...

333
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,400
Really.

334
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,400
If my mother had called the police,

335
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,370
this wouldn't have happened.

336
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,400
If she had told me

337
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,010
that I did nothing wrong,

338
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,810
that she loved me and she would protect me,

339
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,670
maybe I wouldn't be living

340
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,960
in this shadow now.

341
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,310
Wait.

342
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,670
If we report this,

343
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,240
can we really get compensation?

344
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,300
Of course.

345
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,810
What if he's sentenced?

346
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,570
The amount isn't related to the final sentence.

347
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,680
They said

348
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,530
we wouldn't have that much money.

349
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,440
If you trust me

350
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,340
and want to make the best choice

351
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,720
for your child,

352
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,240
I'll pay the compensation.

353
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,300
I understand you want the money now,

354
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,750
but I can't give you.

355
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,060
It would be illegal

356
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,200
to instruct you to sue him.

357
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,480
I understand.

358
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,480
I hope you can

359
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,570
use this money

360
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,440
for the child's therapy.

361
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,370
Definitely.

362
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,050
She's my flesh and blood.

363
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,960
I want her to be okay.

364
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,470
Have you eaten?

365
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,090
Your dad was taken away.

366
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,330
He deserves this.

367
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,680
He's falsely accused.

368
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,290
How can you believe a child's words?

369
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,400
He just gave the little girl a piece of candy.

370
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,610
He didn't molest her.

371
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,050
She's only six years old.

372
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,990
She can't tell right from wrong.

373
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,130
How long are you going to deceive yourself?

374
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,880
You've been his accomplice your whole life.

375
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,850
For everything he's done,

376
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,440
you share the blame.

377
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,640
You should have seen this coming.

378
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,200
The police have filed a case.

379
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,530
Besides the girl's testimony,

380
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,610
there are witnesses and physical evidence.

381
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,570
This time,

382
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,090
he won't get away.

383
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,440
What witnesses?

384
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,290
It's three years
for molesting an underage girl,

385
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,680
but if he's done it

386
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,290
to multiple girls,

387
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,810
multiple times...

388
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,400
I told the police

389
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,770
he raped me.

390
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,530
The statute of limitations has passed,

391
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,710
so it can't be filed as a separate case,

392
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,770
but it can support this case,

393
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,480
proving he's a habitual offender.

394
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,010
How can you kick him when he's down?

395
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,480
I've waited my whole life

396
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,290
for this day.

397
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,340
Do you know why

398
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,130
I didn't want to sell this house?

399
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,430
I wanted to be able

400
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,290
to stand here

401
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,810
one day,

402
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,610
pointing out his crimes

403
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,850
myself.

404
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,050
That night, I screamed for you

405
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,860
with all my might.

406
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,880
I yelled for help,

407
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,050
but you didn't come.

408
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,440
Jie saw it.

409
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,720
He saw

410
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,020
everything

411
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,290
from under the vent.

412
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,570
This time,

413
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,880
you can't control him.

414
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,680
Jie?

415
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,290
Impossible.

416
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,400
That's his own father.

417
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,640
By now, Jie should be

418
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,160
almost done talking to the police.

419
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,620
Continue.

420
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,640
I was woken up by the noise.

421
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,880
I heard my sister crying in the bathroom,

422
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,880
yelling for help.

423
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,240
I ran over

424
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,640
and found the door locked.

425
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,090
I couldn't push it open,

426
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,720
so I got down

427
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,160
and looked through the vent.

428
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,050
With both our testimonies, the police

429
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,390
will investigate all the minors
he's been in contact with.

430
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,990
If new victims are found,

431
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,990
his sentence will increase.

432
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,370
At his age,

433
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,880
he'll likely die in prison.

434
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,330
How can you do this to me?

435
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,480
What am I supposed to do now?

436
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,530
He's just a devil.

437
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,010
And you

438
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,720
are the virus in my blood,

439
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,160
unable to be killed,

440
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,370
never getting better,

441
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,880
just tormenting me.

442
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,680
You deserve this.

443
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,030
I won't come back

444
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,400
to this house.

445
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,200
I won't call you Mom anymore.

446
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,400
Of course, you can live here.

447
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,010
I'll send you money every month.

448
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,030
But

449
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,880
don't control Jie anymore.

450
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,990
Wherever he wants to go,

451
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,290
whatever he wants to do,

452
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,370
don't interfere.

453
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,160
Otherwise,

454
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,130
I'll leave you

455
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,200
to die alone.

456
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,800
The music for your art exhibit

457
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,270
is almost done.

458
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,450
But I feel like

459
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,970
something's missing.

460
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,110
What's missing?

461
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,800
I want to record

462
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,840
the sound of wind at the mountaintop

463
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,630
for the ending.

464
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,540
Is the wind at the mountaintop

465
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,090
different from other places?

466
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,200
I've heard

467
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,360
the wind over grasslands,

468
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,800
over lakes,

469
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,720
and the wind whistling past

470
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,720
while riding a motorcycle.

471
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,800
They're all different.

472
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,450
But I've never climbed a mountain,

473
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,150
so I haven't heard

474
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,530
the mountaintop wind.

475
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,050
You've never climbed a mountain?

476
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,530
The doctor says

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,280
climbing consumes

478
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,050
a lot of oxygen

479
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,160
and demands high heart and lung function.

480
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,010
Climbing could put

481
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,800
too much strain on my heart,

482
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,130
and in severe cases,

483
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,800
I could die suddenly.

484
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,750
I remember

485
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,720
school trips to climb mountains,

486
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,010
but I never joined.

487
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,240
My parents told me

488
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,530
they'd take me

489
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,200
once I got better.

490
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,720
But I waited

491
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,800
a lifetime.

492
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,200
Later, I realized

493
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,680
they were lying.

494
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,540
They knew

495
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,240
I'd never have the chance to climb a mountain.

496
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,720
I'm moving to the dormitory now.

497
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,840
Once I save some money,

498
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,610
I'll rent a place.

499
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,500
That's good.

500
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,280
Take it step by step.

501
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,430
When I said I was moving out,

502
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,530
she didn't stop me.

503
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,200
Don't worry about what she thinks.

504
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,140
What's important now

505
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,530
is to live your own life.

506
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,930
Gengsheng, thank you.

507
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,490
How's the case?

508
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,430
Still investigating.

509
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,360
They say they've found new victims.

510
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,050
How many years will he get?

511
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,620
Multiple cases make it severe.

512
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,890
At least fifteen years.

513
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,530
Have some fruit.

514
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,460
Miss Yimei,

515
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,050
climbing this mountain is tough for me.

516
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,050
Can my brother handle it?

517
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,320
This slope seems relatively gentle.

518
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,950
So, the pace, the route,

519
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,790
everything is important.

520
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,410
We have to think of all possibilities

521
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,570
and have a plan.

522
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,590
But

523
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,160
I still feel like this is risky.

524
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,610
We can't change the destination,

525
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,240
but on the way there,

526
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,890
I don't want him to have any regrets.

527
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,450
But Miss Yimei,

528
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,320
is it really necessary to go to such lengths

529
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,160
for my brother's obsession?

530
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,360
It's no longer just his obsession.

531
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,680
It's mine too.

532
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,490
If I don't climb this mountain with him

533
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,280
and let him die with regrets,

534
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,010
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

535
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,160
If it were me,

536
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,930
I'd want to see sights I've never seen before.

537
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,700
This isn't working.

538
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,970
The pace is too fast.

539
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,350
His heart rate will fluctuate too much.

540
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,190
This won't do.

541
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,540
If we go any slower,

542
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,890
we won't reach the top in a day.

543
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,450
Then we'll climb it over several days.

544
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,500
Let's go. Which way?

545
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,530
- This way.
- Over here.

546
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,090
That's basically it.

547
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,130
We're not aiming for speed.

548
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,320
We need to control the heart rate.

549
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,430
If you feel any discomfort,

550
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,500
you must speak up immediately

551
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,930
and stop. Understand?

552
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,580
I'll carry the water, food, and other supplies.

553
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,280
You just need to bring your medication

554
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,200
and a fitness watch.

555
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,910
Alright.

556
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,090
Your shoe size is 42.

557
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,270
Try this one.

558
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,640
- Does it fit?
- It's good.

559
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,470
Try this one.

560
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,570
You're well-prepared.

561
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,060
It fits well.

562
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,990
And this.

563
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,930
A hiking stick.

564
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,870
Choose one. There are markings.

565
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,100
You can adjust it to your height.

566
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,940
How about this one?

567
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,860
I'll give it a try.

568
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,790
It's great.

569
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,020
How do I look?

570
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,900
Pretty cool, right?

571
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,060
Yeah.

572
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,540
Thank you.

573
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,890
Do you think

574
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,570
all this effort

575
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,530
is meaningless?

576
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,530
Meaning is relative.

577
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,190
So beautiful.

578
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,970
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

579
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,680
First time climbing a mountain.

580
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,640
We've climbed so high.

581
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,320
Come on.

582
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,410
It's not even higher than your apartment.

583
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,940
Honestly,

584
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,240
it's easier than I imagined.

585
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,460
Let's take a break.

586
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,980
Alright.

587
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,100
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

588
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,940
Just a bit winded.

589
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,310
Here, sit for a moment.

590
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,450
I'll capture some other sounds.

591
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,200
Take a rest.

592
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,910
The wind at the mountain

593
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,290
really is different from that on flat land.

594
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,490
I wouldn't know unless I came up here.

595
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,460
Have a bite.

596
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,610
What are you doing?

597
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,010
