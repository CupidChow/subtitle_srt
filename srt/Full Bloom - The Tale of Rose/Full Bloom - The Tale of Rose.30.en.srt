00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 30=

3
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,670
How does it feel to hold Taotao?

4
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,510
Ticklish.

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,820
Ticklish?

6
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,340
I put the rabbit food in my palm.

7
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,030
Taotao's nose tickles my hand when it eats.

8
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,710
It's ticklish.

9
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,540
So, it feels

10
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,590
tingling, right?

11
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,630
What else?

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,670
And also warm, like a roasted sweet potato.

13
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,710
Warm?

14
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,660
Let's write a song

15
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,030
about that tingly and warm feeling, okay?

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,150
Okay.

17
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,110
Try it out.

18
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,830
Does it sound good?

19
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,390
Alright.

20
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,060
Let's play to this rhythm, okay?

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,430
Okay.

22
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,060
Chubby,

23
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,780
Taotao is a little bunny.

24
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,740
It loves to sing.

25
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,110
It loves to dance.

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,620
We sleep together.

27
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,780
Have you arrived at the hotel?

28
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,340
Almost, I'm in the taxi.

29
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,460
Send me the license plate number.

30
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,270
No need to worry. I'm almost there.

31
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,590
Let's keep chatting

32
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,220
until you get to the room.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,620
What do you want to talk about?

34
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,900
Do you think our wedding was too simple?

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,740
We just got the certificate.

36
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,340
Nothing changed before and after the wedding.

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,020
What else could we do?

38
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,620
No wedding ceremony.

39
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,740
No wedding photos.

40
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,830
Just two rings.

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,990
You don't dream

42
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,990
of wearing a wedding dress, do you?

43
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,620
Nonsense.

44
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,310
I just feel

45
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,990
I married such a good wife.

46
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,940
Shouldn't I thank you

47
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,620
for it?

48
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,660
You can thank me when I get back.

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Talk to you later.

50
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm almost at the hotel.

51
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,390
Go to sleep, okay?

52
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,180
Bye.

53
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,630
Where am I going to get that much money?

54
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,510
Zhou, are you busy?

55
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,300
Come over for a moment.

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Mr. Zhou.

57
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,030
Here you are.

58
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,030
Sit down.

59
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,030
What's up?

60
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,590
Is work going smoothly?

61
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,300
Yes.

62
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,950
Is there anything

63
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,510
the company can help you with?

64
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,430
No.

65
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,500
Then

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,220
can you help me with something?

67
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,500
Well.

68
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,980
You know about me and Su, right?

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,470
All my salary

70
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,790
and bonuses

71
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,590
go to her account.

72
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,700
You know.

73
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,060
I need some money

74
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,300
for something

75
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,750
I can't tell her about.

76
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,340
I wonder

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,910
if you can help me.

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,180
How much do you need?

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,660
200,000 or two million?

80
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,590
I don't have two million.

81
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,190
200,000 yuan.

82
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,660
Money isn't the problem.

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Then what is?

84
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,590
What's the secret you can't tell her?

85
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm curious.

86
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,070
Stop teasing.

87
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,710
If money isn't the problem,

88
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,460
just give it to me.

89
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,950
Tell me what's the secret first.

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,780
I can't tell her, so I can't tell you either.

91
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,420
If you can't tell me, I can't lend you money.

92
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,830
- I have to know why.
- I need it urgently.

93
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,710
I'll repay you with the year-end bonus.

94
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,780
I'll pay you back.

95
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,830
I'm just borrowing it.

96
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,220
I know that.

97
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,780
You need to tell me why you need it.

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,830
Aren't you prying into my privacy?

99
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,190
Have I ever pried into yours?

100
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,900
Almost done. Let's put the rabbit in.

101
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,030
Alright.

102
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,950
Goodbye, Taotao.

103
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,590
In the other world, eat well.

104
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,910
Goodbye, Taotao.

105
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,870
Fang Taichu,

106
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,860
look what I brought for Taotao.

107
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,830
So it won't go hungry.

108
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,540
The teacher said rabbits can't eat chocolate.

109
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,540
Then we will eat it for Taotao.

110
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,910
Okay.

111
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,870
For Taotao.

112
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,180
Here.

113
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,700
I'll eat this.

114
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,950
Taotao has eaten it.

115
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,780
Are you having a funeral or a picnic?

116
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,260
Back to work.

117
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,190
Fu Jiaming, goodbye.

118
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,220
Fang Taichu, goodbye.

119
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Goodbye.

120
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

121
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,700
(Hotel)

122
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,780
Mom, today I have to meet

123
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,860
a very important client,

124
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,830
so I can't see you off.

125
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,780
I called a taxi for you.

126
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,140
Okay.

127
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,430
Wait a moment.

128
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,990
You said you liked the sea cucumbers,

129
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,580
so I bought you two more boxes

130
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,150
and some Beijing specialties.

131
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,990
You bought so much.

132
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,030
It's too extravagant.

133
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,950
It's what I should do.

134
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,180
Mom, have a safe trip.

135
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Alright, okay.

136
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,350
About Gengsheng...

137
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,470
Don't worry. I won't tell her you came.

138
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,870
Good.

139
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,660
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

140
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,940
Alright, goodbye.

141
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,470
Fu Jiaming.

142
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,260
Jiaming.

143
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,900
You're here earlier than me.

144
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,030
Your friend insisted on seeing you perform.

145
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,870
Really?

146
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,990
Fang Taichu.

147
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,700
Fu Jiaming, this is for you.

148
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,710
What is it?

149
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,750
He looks so cute, just like me.

150
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,470
Fu Jiaming,

151
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,870
last night I sang a song to Taotao,

152
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,660
and I dreamed of it.

153
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,700
What did you dream of?

154
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,990
Taotao wanted to eat ice cream.

155
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,180
Tell Taotao

156
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,420
we'll buy ice cream for it

157
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,300
and eat together, okay?

158
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,260
Okay.

159
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,020
Fang Taichu,

160
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,780
can you do me a favor tonight?

161
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,020
What favor?

162
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,310
Come on.

163
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,750
Good evening, everyone.

164
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,110
Tonight's guest performer

165
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,110
is my good friend.

166
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,180
Her name is Fang Taichu.

167
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,060
She wrote a song for her friend Taotao,

168
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,990
so I invited her to perform

169
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,060
with me tonight, okay?

170
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,630
Great!

171
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,760
Give her a round of applause. Okay.

172
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,580
Alright, we can start.

173
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,350
Warm and chubby,

174
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,660
Taotao is a little bunny.

175
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,230
It loves to sing and dance.

176
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,750
We sleep together.

177
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,350
Warm and chubby,

178
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,870
Taotao is a little bunny.

179
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,270
It loves to sing and dance.

180
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,630
We sleep together.

181
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,940
Warm and chubby,

182
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,470
Taotao is a little bunny.

183
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,990
Bravo!

184
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,390
Nice!

185
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,380
Great!

186
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,280
Great!

187
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,110
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

188
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,300
(Elephant Music Bar)

189
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,660
- Thank you.
- Take it easy.

190
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,830
Thank you for today.

191
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,780
No problem.

192
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,110
I didn't pay you for the performance.

193
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,510
Alright, we're leaving.

194
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
I'll see you off.

195
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,070
How are you going to do that?

196
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,900

197
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,270

♪As long as you remember me♪

214
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,270
The best spot for the sculpture exhibition

215
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,340
is definitely the first floor,

216
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,540
but we have a photography exhibition there

217
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,420
that lasts for six weeks.

218
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,230
Based on our schedule,

219
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,470
the earliest date will be in September.

220
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,420
That's fine. We need time to prepare anyway.

221
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,750
But if there are

222
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,660
only twenty pieces,

223
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,580
the first floor should be enough.

224
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,780
I'll see if I can arrange resources

225
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,510
for an exhibition on the 2nd

226
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,290
and 3rd floors simultaneously.

227
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,110
Hurry up with the materials.

228
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,580
I won't reserve it for you if you're late.

229
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,540
Got it, got it.

230
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,510
I still like it

231
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,390
when you're so focused on work.

232
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,510
It's so cute.

233
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Holding so tightly.

234
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,260
Are you in love?

235
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,660
How did you see that?

236
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,140
Really?

237
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,870
Who is it?

238
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,110
Who is it? Where did you meet?

239
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,940
Fu Jiaming?

240
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,030
How did they end up together?

241
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,820
Rose set up a riddle

242
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,230
at the art exhibition.

243
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,470
Only Fu Jiaming solved it.

244
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,700
She scattered breadcrumbs

245
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,110
only to catch herself a boyfriend.

246
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,940
A potential one. They haven't confessed yet.

247
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,940
Fu Jiaming?

248
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,590
Is he reliable?

249
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Don't you think they are alike?

250
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,060
Hope she won't fall down again this time.

251
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,300
Then help her check him out.

252
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,620
How?

253
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
By peeking through the window?

254
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,030
Does your company have a budget?

255
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,030
Why? Do you need money?

256
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,380
Let's have a work outing

257
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,910
that includes family.

258
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,750
You're so smart.

259
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,620
By the way, Jiaming,

260
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,860
the company is having an outing this weekend,

261
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,000
and we're allowed to bring family.

262
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
Can you come with me?

263
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
They said family,

264
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,310
not brothers.

265
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,230
Mr. Huang asked me to invite you.

266
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,910
He's bringing a lot of family too.

267
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,430
Miss Yimei and her daughter are going too.

268
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,750
They're going?

269
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,510
Go tell Mom.

270
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,790
Go ahead.

271
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,340
Mommy,

272
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,990
Uncle said we'll have an outing this weekend.

273
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,430
Uncle is taking colleagues.

274
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,990
You don't need to follow and cause trouble.

275
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,430
How about I take you to the amusement park?

276
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,990
No, I want to go with Uncle and Auntie.

277
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,670
The company has a budget for the family.

278
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,540
Why don't you come along?

279
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,780
I'll pass.

280
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,230
I have a lot of work to do.

281
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,990
If you don't mind the hassle,

282
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,030
take Taichu. I could use some peace.

283
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,270
Taichu,

284
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,990
would you like to go with me and Auntie?

285
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,580
One of your good friends will be there.

286
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,750
Who?

287
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,140
Uncle Fu Jiaming.

288
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,340
He misses you.

289
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,420
Do you miss him?

290
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,700
Yes.

291
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,230
If you don't go, I'll pick Taichu up on Friday.

292
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,710
You're the boss.

293
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
You need to organize, right?

294
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,710
Let me take the kid.

295
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,140
You're too considerate of me.

296
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,180
Thanks, Rose.

297
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,030
So this weekend you'll go with me, Auntie,

298
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,540
and Uncle Fu Jiaming.

299
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,950
Jiaming, we'll greet them.

300
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,510
Mr. Huang, you're not driving?

301
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I can sleep a bit on the bus.

302
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,620
Get on the bus.

303
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,550
Where's your wife?

304
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,670
Already on the bus.

305
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,900
You're not riding the motorcycle?

306
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,620
There's a driver, right?

307
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,510
Get on the bus.

308
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,870
What are you looking for, Jiaming?

309
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,140
Where's Fang Taichu?

310
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,350
Where's Fang Taichu?

311
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,670
She's in her mom's car. There's no safety seat.

312
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,510
Her mom didn't feel safe.

313
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,820
I'll ride with them.

314
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,910
Fang Taichu, can I ride with you?

315
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,580
Sure, get in.

316
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,790
Thank you.

317
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,510
These two are a match.

318
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,060
Stop looking. Get on the bus.

319
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,990
It's dark.

320
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,380

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,750
and I'm a good woman too.

380
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,780
It's just that we weren't compatible.

381
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,990
You're more than just good.

382
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,670
Let's go take a look over there.

383
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,510
Taichu!

384
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,620
- Taichu, what did you stick on your face?
- Auntie.

385
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,190
What did you stick on your face?

386
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,620
Looks really nice.

387
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,540
Stick some on Auntie later.

388
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,380
Come on.

389
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,860
Here, let's have a drink.

390
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,780
Cheers.

391
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,230
Drink your milk.

392
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,030
Get some nutrition.

393
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,230
Do you like spicy food? Want some chili flakes?

394
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,990
- Add some.
- Here, come here.

395
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,510
- Add some.
- Okay, here you go.

396
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,950
Try some. Here.

397
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,300
Thank you.

398
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,380
Delicious.

399
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,590
Try this one.

400
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,350
Is it good?

401
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,460
Yeah.

402
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,860
Game meat is here.

403
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,380
- What's this?
- What game meat?

404
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,270
Are these cicadas and grasshoppers?

405
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,710
Yeah, I caught them in the wild just now.

406
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
Are you sure they're food?

407
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,620
Here, try some

408
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,950
to make up for your childhood regrets.

409
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,270
I never lacked this kind of meat.

410
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,750
Why are you lacking a spirit of adventure?

411
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,590
Have a bite.

412
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,580
Who wants some? Do you want to try it?

413
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,440
I don't want it. I don't want it.

414
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,310
Thank you. I don't want it.

415
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,470
Then I'll eat alone.

416
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,620
Delicious.

417
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,660
Rose.

418
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,750
Look.

419
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,380
Delicious, right?

420
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,470
Get ready. Start!

421
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,140
- Go, go faster.
- Come on!

422
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,300
Come on!

423
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,350
Faster!

424
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,990
Taichu, come on!

425
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,180
Faster!

426
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
Taichu, come on!

427
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,820
First place. Second place.

428
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Hello, Mr. Huang.

429
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,070
Did you catch anything?

430
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,780
No chopsticks, so you can't eat?

431
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,820
If I had known this was for them,

432
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,660
I wouldn't have come.

433
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,620
If I had known he was coming,
I wouldn't have come.

434
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,820
Isn't this from "Dream of the Red Chamber"?

435
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,300
I just can't stand the fact

436
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,910
you use it as an excuse

437
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,300
for them to get along.

438
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,340
Did our company have this event?

439
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
Can this event increase our cohesion?

440
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,230
If you think I'm misusing public resources,

441
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,620
I'll pay for the event myself.

442
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,750
Forget it.

443
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,820
If you're so wealthy,

444
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,340
why did you borrow money from me?

445
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,030
Didn't I tell you? I'll pay you back

446
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,430
with the year-end bonus.

447
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,510
Why are you so petty?

448
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,220
What money?

449
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,830
Is she asleep?

450
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,270
Come out.

451
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,380
What? Taichu is sleeping inside.

452
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Why did you borrow money?

453
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,470
I told you. It's not for me.

454
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,030
I borrowed it for Rose.

455
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,430
You're really bad at lying.

456
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,990
You can't get mad if I tell you.

457
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,510
During your business trip,

458
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,100
your mom came to visit.

459
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,230
She came and asked you for money?

460
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,510
She is right.

461
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,710
I need to give her a bride price.

462
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,820
We didn't even tell her when we got married.

463
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,140
Why should we tell her?

464
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,100
How much did she ask you for?

465
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,660
Not much.

466
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,700
Just 20,000.

467
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,590
No way.

468
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,670
She specifically came from our hometown

469
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,580
to find you when I wasn't home.

470
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,750
That won't be enough for her.

471
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,070
How much exactly?

472
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,710
You're so smart.

473
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,030
Added a zero, 200,000.

474
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,750
Did you give it to her?

475
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,380
I don't have that kind of money here.

476
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,190
I borrowed it from Zhou.

477
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,270
I'll pay him back at the end of the year.

478
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,780
Why did you secretly give her money?

479
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,270
That's your mom.

480
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,670
If I don't give her money, she's unhappy.

481
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,060
If I do give her money, you're unhappy.

482
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,470
Why can't I please both sides?

483
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,190
I'll give you the money back later.

484
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,710
What are you saying?

485
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,790
You're my wife.

486
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,230
Do we need to be so clear about these things?

487
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,340
That's my own business.

488
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,860
If you had told me earlier,

489
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,140
it wouldn't have caused such big trouble.

490
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,510
How did I cause trouble?

491
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,470
We're a couple.

492
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,580
We're in this together.

493
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,710
You have conflicts with your mom.

494
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,430
Why should I bear the brunt?

495
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,100
What's wrong? Taichu is sleeping.

496
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,310
Be quiet.

497
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,620
What are you doing with that bag?

498
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,140
Are we allowed to paddle the boat?

499
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,750
Boats are meant for paddling.

500
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,830
Come on.

501
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,540
No one is watching so late.

502
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,580
What if something happens?

503
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,820
What? Are you scared?

504
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,460
Come on.

505
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,510
Have you fallen in love with me?

506
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,750
Yes.

How did you know I was thinking of this song?

524
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,620
Because I sensed your brain waves.

525
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,870
Nonsense.

526
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,380
It's true.

527
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,060
Actually, people in ancient times

528
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,430
already discovered brain waves.

529
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,060
Do you know

530
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,910
Cao Zhi's "Ode to the Goddess
of the Luo River"?

531
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,060
Without a proper matchmaker to convey my joy,

532
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,230
I shall rely on gentle waves to send my words.

533
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,460
Exactly.

534
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,910
Without a suitable matchmaker

535
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,620
to express love for himself,

536
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,380
so he used waves.

537
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,710
Isn't that brain waves?

538
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,910
Is that what he meant?

539
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,380
At that time,

540
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,190
there was no radio.

541
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,750
He was here,

542
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,430
thinking about her,

543
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,230
while on the other side,

544
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,750
the Goddess sensed it.

545
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,540
She read his mind.

546
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,860
So, guess what I'm thinking right now.

547
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,510
Let me guess.

548
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,790
You're thinking of me.

549
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,550
Where are you?

550
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,590
Are you at work?

551
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,750
Yesterday, I wanted to come back overnight,

552
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,340
but no one was there for Taichu,

553
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,950
and then I fell asleep.

554
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,540
Zhenhua, you were right.

555
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,790
I shouldn't have taken my anger out on you.

556
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,700
Who do you want to take it out on?

557
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,260
(Domestic Departures)

558
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,580
Where are you?

559
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,220
I'm going to handle this.

560
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,670
I'll be back home in a few days.

561
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,020
You...

562
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,350
Jiamin,

563
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,310
take a look around with Mimi.

564
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,580
- Is here all right?
- Absolutely, Jiaming.

565
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,910
I believe your judgment.

566
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,180
We'll just take away these tables.

567
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,220
Let's set up a long table.

568
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,240
Okay.

569
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,540
Get rid of this one too.

570
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,100
Let's set up a big long table.

571
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,620
It'll be enough for 30 or 40 people.

572
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,500
Right?

573
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,060
But there are some scratches on the floor.

574
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,620
Let's cover them all up

575
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,900
with a red carpet.

576
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,100
Are we doing Chinese or Western style?

577
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,260
I think we should do Chinese style.

578
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,700
So our parents can take pictures

579
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,950
and show off to those foreigners.

580
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,180
Sure. We can have a blend.

581
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,510
Both of you are Chinese.

582
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,970
How can you blend Chinese and Western styles?

583
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,310
One wears a wedding gown,

584
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,870
and the other wears a traditional Chinese robe?

585
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,730
Do you want an erhu version

586
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,100
of the wedding march?

587
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,350
Well, Jiaming.

588
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,580
You chose this place.

589
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,620
Help us choose the style too.

590
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,580
We'll leave it to you.

591
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,830
Jiamin looks simple and honest.

592
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,310
You have a baby face.

593
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,350
I personally think

594
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,830
Chinese style would be more suitable.

595
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,870
I knew it. Chinese style it is.

596
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,390
Okay. I'll listen to my brother.

597
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,830
The environment's not too bad, right?

598
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,670
Of course.

599
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,020
Miss Yimei.

600
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,190
You're here.

601
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,900
Yes.

602
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,620
When did they get together?

603
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,110
Never mind.

604
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,160
It's good anyway.

605
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
I'm worried

606
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,640
if Miss Yimei knows about my brother's health.

607
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,440
The doctor said after the surgery,

608
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,840
he recovered well.

609
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,220
As long as he takes good care of himself,

610
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,540
he'll be no different from a normal person.

611
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,310
But after all, he's not a normal person.

612
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,750
What do you think?

613
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,470
Should I tell Miss Yimei?

614
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,790
No.

615
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,910
This is between them.

616
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,350
They'll handle it.

617
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,760
Besides, they're in their honeymoon phase.

618
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,540
Why bring up unhappy things now?

619
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,500
Well.

620
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,540
If they were to get married in the future,

621
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,020
should I tell her?

622
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,060
Jiamin.

623
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,060
You really are an honest person.

624
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,310
Do you think I'm really stupid?

625
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,910
You're just that stupid.

626
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,180
I like you that way.

627
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,830
Take your time.

628
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,870
You're talented.

629
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,940
(Elephant Music Bar)

630
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,510
I want to try this too.

631
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,870
You want to try it too?

632
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,980
It's very heavy.

633
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,350
Well, catch here.

634
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,910
You really are strong.

635
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,910
It's over there.

636
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,870
Keep it down.

637
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,460
Come.

638
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,790
- Is it here?
- Shh.

639
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,380
Listen to my headphones.

640
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,310
Can you hear it?

641
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,700
This way.

642
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,310
Shh. Stop talking. Keep it down.

643
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,700
An airplane!

644
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,870
Mommy, look.

645
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,660
It's like the one I took to see Daddy.

646
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,310
When I grow up,

647
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,030
I want to fly a plane to see Daddy.

648
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,620
When you grow up,

649
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,060
do you want me on your plane for fun?

650
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,230
Sure.

651
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,790
Fang Taichu,

652
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,260
I want to be your mom's boyfriend.

653
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,020
What do you think?

654
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,700
What is a boyfriend?

655
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,580
A male friend who's even better than a friend.

656
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,470
Can you also be my boyfriend?

657
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,940
No, that won't work.

658
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,390
After I've been your mom's boyfriend,

659
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,350
I can't be someone else's boyfriend anymore.

660
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,830
Wait until you grow up.

661
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,030
You'll l have your own boyfriend, okay?

662
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,750
Gengsheng,

663
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,470
why are you back?

664
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,460
Did he hit you?

665
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,700
No, I hurt myself.

666
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,470
Why are you here?

667
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,870
You've been to my house.

668
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,470
You should know why I'm back.

669
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,620
I heard from Jie that you got married.

670
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,390
Why didn't you tell us?

671
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,990
We could have met your husband.

672
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,430
To see him or to ask him for money?

673
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,660
Basic courtesy is necessary.

674
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,060
Otherwise,

675
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,390
people will laugh at us

676
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,740
for letting you marry him

677
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,180
without a bride price.

678
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,310
Where's the money?

679
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,220
Did he take it all?

680
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,390
He wants to live a good life now.

681
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,430
He used the money to start a small business

682
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,140
and bought me lots of good food.

683
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,260
He's deceived you so many times.

684
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,700
Why do you still defend him?

685
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,830
You even helped him scam Zhenhua's money.

686
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,470
He gave me the money voluntarily.

687
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Did he regret it

688
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,430
and send you to get it back?

689
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,020
Or...

690
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,220
Did he hear something?

691
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,830
Hear what?

692
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,470
Those unspeakable things.

693
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,060
The one who can't face the public

694
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,230
is not me.
