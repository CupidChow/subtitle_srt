4
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,430
Welcome everyone to the opening

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,820
of Manman Art Gallery's inaugural exhibition.

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,060
Bravo!

7
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,870
The name Manman was given by an old friend.

8
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,510
One year, we visited an exhibition

9
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,350
in a Paris gallery.

10
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,430
I don't remember the details of the exhibition,

11
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,740
but we were both captivated by the ivy

12
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,310
outside the gallery that day.

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,310
It left a deep impression on us.

14
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,030
He said to me

15
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,830
that actually,

16
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,660
people are like these ivy vines.

17
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,950
When they meet,

18
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,300
they entangle

19
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,060
and grow separately,

20
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,950
spreading out.

21
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,500
There are many such souls

22
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,460
intertwining

23
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,690
and connecting across time and space.

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,990
I hope the Manman Art Gallery

25
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,710
is not just an exhibition hall,

26
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,310
but a connecting node

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,830
for art lovers.

28
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,020
Maybe here,

29
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,310
you'll meet a soul
that will entangle with yours

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
for a lifetime.

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,710

Let's have a drink.

38
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,870
I quit over thirty years ago.

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,500
Now I only use it externally, not internally.

40
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,790
You've quit since childhood?

41
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,550
When I was eight,
I ate a piece of liquor chocolate

42
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,780
and almost slept to death.

43
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,150
- Right.
- Take your time.

44
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,030
Look at this painting and the one below.

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,870
How are they?

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,990
The styles are completely different.

47

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,340
I haven't seen her.

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,110
Such a tease.

Dad,

59
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,940
do you still need these kraft paper documents?

60
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,190
Yes.

61
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,110
Put them over there.

62
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
I'll sort them out later.

63
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,540
You're like a scrap collector.

64
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,390
Look, here's your old homework.

65
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,660

How was the inaugural exhibition?

73
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,190
It went well.

74
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm sorry.

75
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,990
What are you apologizing for?

76
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
I messed up.

77
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,230
Why do you always blame yourself?

78
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,660
I'm going back to France

79
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,750

80
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,260
Bon voyage.

81
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,420
If you need me, I can come back anytime.

82
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,470
Alright.

83
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,580
I won't be polite.

84

We'll still work together in the future.

85
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,900

92
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,150

98
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,470
is like having a broken bone.

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,870
It's excruciating at first,

100
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,900
but after a few months,

101
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,270
once it's healed,

102
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,540
she'll act like nothing happened.

104
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,230

It flares up every season.

106
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,110
It won't kill you

107
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
but tortures you for life.

108
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,060
You've had many relationships.

109
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,820
Why are you only allergic to my mom?

110
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,780
Isn't one like your mom enough?

111
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,700
Playing games

112
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
is all about the final big boss.

113
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,150
We were unlucky,

114
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,900
meeting the big boss at the start.

115
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,180
That's why it's getting more boring.

116
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,230
Look,

117
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,700
the heart is sometimes meant to be broken.

00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,940
- Ms. Chen.
- Spending time with the child?

Heading out?

123
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,390
- Just going to buy some groceries.
- Take it slow.

124
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,500
Take it slow.

Mommy.

126
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,870
Mommy, why do dandelions turn into fluff?

127
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,390
Maybe because they carry little umbrellas,

128
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,030
and the wind can blow them far away.

129
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,470
Why do they want to go far away?

130
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,510
Maybe to see different worlds.

131
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,230
Take it slow.

132
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,110
Hello, Jiamin.

133
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,060
Miss Yimei, I'm sorry.

134
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,420
What's wrong?

135
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,540
My brother

136
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,150
altered the painting in your little room.

137
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,420
I don't know how he got the key,

138
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,540
but he just went in.

139
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,580
I'm really sorry, Miss Yimei.

140
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,300
He often does such unreliable things.

141
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,710
What did he change?

142
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,750

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,190
One bottle of beer.

192
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,510
Okay, just a moment.

193
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,380
Waiter.

194
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,190
Bring two more bottles of beer.

195
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,290
Why aren't you drinking?

196
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,300
Okay, just a moment.

197
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,470
Come on, cheers!

198
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
Cheers!

199
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,750
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

200
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,590
Bravo!

201
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,550
Thank you, everyone.

202
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,620
Enjoy your evening.

203
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,700
Thank you.

204
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,060
(Elephant Music Bar)

205
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,900
How are you?

206
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,270
I'm fine.

207
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,620
Turn off the bass.

208
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,860
Just unplug the sound system.

209
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,460
Let's go for a late-night snack.

210
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,660
You guys go ahead.

211
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,510
- We're going then.
- Rest early. See you tomorrow.

212
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,700
Goodbye, Jiaming.

213
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,980
Hurry up.

214
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,790
Mine, mine.

215
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,030
Thank you. Bye-bye.

216
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,940
Treat me to dinner.

217
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,300
Bring the drums too.

218
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,030
Okay.

219
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,230
See you next time. Bye-bye.

220
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,270
Bye-bye.

221
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,460
I'm leaving now.

222
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,380
You've come so quickly.

223
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,710
Looks like I can skip the self-introduction.

224
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,980
How did you recognize me?

225
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,060
Because you're the oldest in the band.

226
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,990
Do you know how I recognized you?

227
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,300
You look just like a painter.

228
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,270
I'm not a painter.

229
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,030
I'm a jack of all trades.

230
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,710
I know a lot of things.

231
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,750
Why did you set my painting to rock music?

232
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,910
Your painting looked too depressing.

233
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,490
It made people want to jump into the sea.

234
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,540
Don't you think my changes

235
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,550
make you want to surf?

236
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,030
The same scene,

237
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,430
with different music,

238
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,140
can be an art film,

239
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,030
or a commercial film.

240
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,550
If you like,

241
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,940
it can even be a horror film.

242
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,190
I rushed to see your masterpiece.

243
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,300
Didn't have time for dinner.

244
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,350
Dieting?

245
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,700
No.

246
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,980
Do you want some noodles?

247
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,270
My treat.

248
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
This house is rented.

249
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,910
It's my studio

250
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,580
and my living space.

251
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,270
Feel free to look around.

252
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,910
It's a taste of my hometown.

253
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,270
Hope you like it.

254
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,030
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Thanks.

255
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,070
How is it?

256
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,270
Delicious.

257
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,950
How did you make this?

258
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,030
Never mind. Don't teach me.

259
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
I can't learn it anyway.

260
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,580
Aren't you a jack of all trades?

261
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,910
I can't know everything.

262
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,060
Got to leave something for others.

263
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,260
(Goodbye, Mokaf)

264
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,230
These are all your scores?

265
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,830
Gotta make a living.

266
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,670
When you're broke, you take any job.

267
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,540
They're all low-budget, nothing special.

268
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,950
Artists need to live too,

269
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,060
even without work.

270
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,900
Got it.

271
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,500
(Confront the Universe; Whisper to Passersby)

272
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,350
I think

273
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,980
I've seen this film.

274
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,620
Really?

275
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,350
Keep eating.

276
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,780
(Ultimate Stealth)

277
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,460
(Moonlight)

278
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,470
It's delicious. Thank you.

279
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,060
- Enough? Want another bowl?
- Enough, enough.

280
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,160
I'll wash the dish.

281
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,300
No need, just leave it there.

282
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,260
(Viagra)

283
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,620
What?

284
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,340
You're sick.

285
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,700
Why are you leaving?

286
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
Don't misunderstand.

287
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,180
Let me explain.

288
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,350
Let me explain.

289
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,670
It's not what you think.

290
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,030
I am sick.

291
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,700
Don't go.

292
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,710
Don't go. It's a misunderstanding.

293
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,270
This is the third draft

294
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,330
of our office building project.

295
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,670
It mainly improves the functional layout.

296
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,860
But the spatial arrangement

297
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,110
- Mr. Huang.
- and the flow

298
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,340
needs further discussion.

299
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,300
- Your phone.
- Also, about the facade design,

300
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
feel free

301
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,820
to share your thoughts.

302
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,660
Hello.

303
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,180
It's me.

304
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,180
Who is this?

305
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,780
I'm Gengsheng's mother.

306
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,430
- Hold on.
- If there are no major issues...

307
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,270
I'm in a meeting room.

308
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,510
Sorry to keep you waiting.

309
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,860
Are you Huang?

310
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,590
Come on.

311
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,460
Please come in.

312
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,310
Here.

313
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,100
- This is heavy.
- Yes.

314
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,190
Come on. Please come in.

315
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,790
Here.

316
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,510
No need to change shoes.

317
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,230
It's very clean.

318
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
Here.

319
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,460
Have a seat.

320
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,140
No need for the trouble.

321
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,030
Have some water.

322
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,180
Okay.

323
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,990
Gengsheng is on a business trip.

324
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,270
I'll call her

325
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,470
and see if she can come back early.

326
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,900
No need.

327
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,030
Let her work.

328
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,670
I didn't tell her I was coming.

329
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
By the way, I brought you

330
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,470
some local specialties planted by me.

331
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,670
Sweet potatoes, peanuts,

332
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,270
all freshly picked.

333
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,100
You came all this way with such heavy things.

334
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,110
Thank you.

335
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,300
Not at all.

336
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,380
I've been meaning to visit

337
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,510
to see how you're doing after the wedding.

338
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,780
You two are married.

339
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,540
This is my first time meeting my son-in-law.

340
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,470
Sorry for the lack of formality.

341
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,910
Gengsheng said no wedding ceremony.

342
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,340
We didn't even take wedding photos.

343
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,430
We just registered.

344
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,780
It's fine.

345
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,060
We've met now.

346
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,270
You are a great son-in-law.

347
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,380
I feel reassured.

348
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,070
But

349
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,590
why is there

350
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,750
no wedding decorations

351
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,230
at your wedding home?

352
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,380
The walls are too plain.

353
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,580
Have you eaten?

354
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,820
Let's go out to eat.

355
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,070
Anything is fine.

356
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,510
Up to you. You decide.

357
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,750
Let's go eat something.

358
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,870
Let's go.

359
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,700
(Incoming call)

360
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,270
Hello?

361
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,150
Huang Yimei,

362
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,060
let me tell you.

363
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,990
Don't think of people so nastily, got it?

364
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,020
I...

365
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,870
Hello?

366
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,150
Hello?

367
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,230
Hello?

368
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,870
I must explain to you.

369
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,060
That medicine is...

370
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,580
Hello?

371
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,060
Sorry, the number you dialed is turned off.

372
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,830
Braised sea cucumber.

373
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,100
Family Reunion.

374
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,020
Lucky roast duck.

375
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,060
Lord's roast lamb,

376
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,350
Master Qi's favorite pork,

377
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,430
and pear soup.

378
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,350
This is too much.

379
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,660
We can't finish them all.

380
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,840
Mom, these are Beijing specialties.

381
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,060
You don't have to finish everything.

382
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,140
Just taste a little of each.

383
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,990
Whatever is left, I'll pack it up.

384
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,900
Such a considerate child.

385
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,270
Let's serve the dishes.

386
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,990
Okay, please wait a moment.

387
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,310
Where do you

388
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,140
want to stay this time?

389
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,200
Would you like to stay at a hotel?

390
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,830
No, no, that's too expensive.

391
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,510
I'll just stay with you guys.

392
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,100
I'll sleep on the floor.

393
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,100
Actually,

394
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,460
I leave early and come back late every day.

395
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,620
I'm afraid I'll disturb your rest.

396
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,510
No, you won't.

397
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,180
The hotel is on me. I'll pay for it.

398
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,790
That's too extravagant.

399
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,950
It's my pleasure.

400
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,470
How long are you staying?

401
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,700
Do you want to look around?

402
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,230
Huang,

403
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,660
I came this time

404
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,030
to discuss something with you.

405
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,350
Go ahead.

406
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,950
You see.

407
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,310
Gengsheng's father died early.

408
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,220
I worked hard

409
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,540
to raise her alone.

410
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,310
Later, I married her stepdad.

411
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,540
Though he's not her biological father,

412
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,310
he's never treated her poorly.

413
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,350
We even sent her to college.

414
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,510
She now works in Beijing

415
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,830
and hasn't come back in years.

416
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,230
It's good

417
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,350
you two are finally married now.

418
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,910
But in our hometown,

419
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,870
when marrying off a daughter,

420
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,950
we have to collect a bride price.

421
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,060
People will laugh at us if we don't.

422
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,660
- They'll say about our family...
- Well,

423
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,180
what are the customs in your hometown?

424
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,830
Actually, it's just a token

425
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,740
for good luck.

426
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,100
200,000 yuan.

427
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,260
Okay, no problem.

428
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,420
Well.

429
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,790
That's the minimum.

430
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,350
If the bride price is too low,

431
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,870
people will look down on us.

432
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,910
Last year, her aunt's daughter got married,

433
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,830
they received 400,000

434
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,060
and a new car.

435
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,990
And the year before,

436
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,060
her uncle's daughter got married.

437
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,620
That's more impressive.

438
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,350
They got 600,000.

439
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,750
Really.

440
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,620
So, you see. That's our custom.

441
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm thinking on your behalf,

442
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,180
so I set the minimum.

443
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,310
Thank you. Here, have some water.

444
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,460
Okay.

445
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,310
It's quite hot.

446
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,030
More drinks are coming.

447
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,870
The pear soup.

448
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,310
Oh, it's soup.

449
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,750
Good for the lungs.

450
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,270
Sure.

451
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,630
Right.

452
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,470
One-two-one.

453
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,580
One-two-one.

454
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,790
One-two-one.

455
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,910
One-two-one.

456
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,060
One-two-one.

457
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,540
One-two-one.

458
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,700
One-two-one.

459
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,510
One-two-one.

460
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,660
One-two-one.

461
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,140
One-two-one.

462
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,350
One-two-one.

463
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,830
Are you stalking me?

464
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,740
This is a kindergarten.

465
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,310
Stay away, pervert.

466
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,380
Pervert?

467
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,790
Who's the pervert?

468
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,260
Taking that kind of pill on the first meeting.

469
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,350
If that's not perverted, what is it?

470
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,430
Going home with someone on the first meeting.

471
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,180
Who's the real pervert here?

472
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,540
I won't let you slander me

473
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,660
for no reason today.

474
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,260
Let me educate you.

475
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,660
Sildenafil Citrate,

476
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,430
also known as Viagra.

477
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,030
People know it

478
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,100
for another purpose,

479
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,700
but it's covered by health insurance

480
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,180
not for treating impotence

481
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,350
but for heart disease treatment. Understand?

482
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,870
You have heart disease?

483
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,140
You look so lively.

484
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,180
Who would believe you're sick?

485
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,220
That is none of your business.

486
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,740
I came today to tell you.

487
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,740
Stop thinking the worst of people.

488
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,030
I'm not as desperate as you think.

489
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,310
Who are you calling desperate?

490
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,990
You're the one with the problem.

491
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,870
Not just here,

492
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,790
but here too.

493
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,190
Hello?

494
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,030
Hello, Taichu's mom?

495
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,580
Can you come to the classroom?

496
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,950
Something's wrong with Taichu.

497
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,350
Okay, I'll be right there.

498
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,100
Hello, Class Two.

499
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,940
Can you open the door?

500
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,420
Sure.

501
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,940
Cheer up.

502
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,350
Teacher.

503
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,620
- What's wrong?
- This is the pet rabbit

504
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,310
we keep for the kids.

505
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,310
It's named Taotao.

506
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,950
Taichu loves it.

507
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,620
She rushed to feed it every time.

508
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,670
Taichu,

509
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,310
your rabbit has gone to another world,

510
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,500
right?

511
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,510
Where did it go?

512
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,260
It's right here,

513
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,430
but it's not moving.

514
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,230
It's dead.

515
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,140
Okay, don't cry.

516
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,950
Okay, don't cry.

517
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
Don't cry.

518
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,300
(Healthy Low Sugar, Freshly Selected)

519
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,260
(Happy Birthday)

520
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,140
Why eat a birthday cake?

521
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,670
You made her cry.

522
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,950
You fix it.

523
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,990
Because the rabbit died.

524
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,670
Think about it.

525
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,140
When friends are together,

526
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,150
we need to eat together.

527
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,510
When a friend leaves, we need to see them off.

528
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,220
When the rabbit leaves,

529
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,990
you eat a piece of cake to see it off, right?

530
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,510
Before eating the cake, we must sing.

531
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,390
Rabbits are different from people.

532
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,310
For people,

533
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,430
you sing first then eat the cake.

534
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,060
For rabbits,

535
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,100
you eat the cake first then sing.

536
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,100
Right?

537
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,510
After eating the cake, what then?

538
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,350
After eating, she'll forget.

539
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,060
Have a piece.

540
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,150
Eat more.

541
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,950
This place is famous.

542
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,220
Alright, finished.

543
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,310
Let's go home.

544
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,510
We haven't sung for Taotao yet.

545
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,540
She still remembers.
