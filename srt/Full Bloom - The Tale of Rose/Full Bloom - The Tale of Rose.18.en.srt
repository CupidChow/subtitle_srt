Su,

4
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,430
it's been a long time
since I heard from you.

5
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,310
I miss you a lot.

6
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,310
Last time, I didn't handle things well

7
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,980
and said things I shouldn't have.

8
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,150
When faced with pain,

9
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,870
some people cry their hearts out,

10
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,820
and others grit their teeth
and say nothing.

11
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,670
I shouldn't have encouraged you
to scream,

12
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,230
but should have held your hand tightly.

13
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,550

Being a mother is not easy.

I've worked hard, changing diapers
and cleaning up after you.

32
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,710
I raised you.

33
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,900
Now you're trying to take my house.

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,430
You're trying to kill us all.

35
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,310
Why is my life so miserable?

36
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,460
You want to take my house?

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,180
Don't think about it.

38
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,110
Let me tell you.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,870
I'll never transfer this house
to you, even if I die.

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
Don't even think about it.

41
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,060
You're making me so angry.

42
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,030
I've raised you for so long.

43
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,180
Now that we are in trouble,

44
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,110
what's wrong
with helping us with some money?

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,550
You still want to take this house?

46
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,830
I just can't live like this.

47
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,510
You shouldn't have given them the money.

48
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,460
After giving the money to them,

49
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,950
he ran away again.

50
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,460
He hasn't been home for days.

51
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,540
Mom's at home crying and making a scene,

52
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,860
and she's always venting her anger on me.

53
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,180
Gengsheng,

54
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,270
you don't need to buy me these things.

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm working now

56
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,300
and making some money myself.

57
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,660
Hasn't your money

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,460
been taken away by them?

59
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,390
How much money do you have left?

60
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,140
Gengsheng,

61
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,540
I know you hate me.

62
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,140
Why?

63
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,420
Because of that thing.

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,390
I really don't remember.

65
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,980
You're an adult now.

67
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,830
What can he do to you?

68
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Why are you still so afraid of him?

69
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,570
Do I need to change my shoes?

70
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,700
No.

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,710
This is your home? It's small.

72
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,630
It's just an attic.

73
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,190
During this time,
I've been thinking a lot.

74
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,590
Those negative emotions

75
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,100
from my problems

76
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,420
shouldn't be vented on you.

77
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,030
I haven't even met him,

78
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,220
and it wasn't fair for me

79
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,100
to judge your relationship so harshly.

80
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,350
It's my fault.

81
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,270
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,460
Are you in Shanghai just to apologize?

83
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,630
Stop flattering yourself.

84
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,060
Just passing by.

85
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,510
- You are.
- I'm passing by.

86
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,500
Xiaohe?

87
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,030
It's really you.

88
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,340
I thought it was you from over there.

89
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,350
Long time no see.

90
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,980
Yeah, what a coincidence.

91
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,510
Do you still remember this place?

92
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,300
Yeah.

93
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,300
The first time I went fishing

94
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,510
was with you.

95
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,420
Then I'm your mentor.

96
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,070
It's my honor.

97
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,460
Will I bother you if I stay here?

98
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,870
Of course not.

99
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,750
Fishing is about enjoying the waiting.

100
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,660
Whether you catch anything
depends on fate.

101
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,950
That's right.

102
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,230
Let's keep fishing.

103
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,430
Okay.

104
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,750
You're still young.

105
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,190
How did you manage to develop this habit?

106
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,340
Isn't there an age limit for fishing?

107
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,270
You're not much older than me.

108
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,940
Don't you like fishing?

109
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,420
Fishing is good for health.

110
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,990
It exercises your mind and body

111
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,420
without being too intense.

112
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,500
Especially suitable for us
middle-aged people

113
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,150
who spend a lot of time in the office,

114
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,390
can't stop thinking,

115
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,300
and can't keep up with physical activity.

116
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,390
You're not that old.

117
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,540
I look fine, right?

118
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,990
But not as good as when I was younger.

119
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,390
Ten years ago, I could stay up all night
dancing and drinking,

120
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,180
and the next day
I could still get up for work.

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,580
Can't do that now.

122
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,150
I can't even drink Chinese white wine.

123
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,230
A sip makes me dizzy.

124
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,940
I don't know if the problem

125
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,900
is with the liquor or me.

126
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,940
They say good liquor
doesn't get you drunk,

127
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,390
but it just has fewer other alcohols.

128
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,270
It's high in methanol content,

129
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,920
which is hard for the body to metabolize.

130
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,830
So,

131
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,150
can I understand it this way?

132
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
If I drink 100% pure alcohol,
I won't get drunk.

133
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,500
No, that's not possible.

134
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,150
Alcohol can cause acidosis,

135
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,700
affecting the body's potassium,

136
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,870
sodium, chloride, and other ions,

137
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,150
and causing nerve damage.

138
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,350
You're joking with me again.

139
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,470
You're still the same serious

140
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,540
and meticulous
when it comes to your profession.

141
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,700
So someone like me
with such low emotional intelligence

142
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,540
should just stay in school.

143
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,710
You graduated, right?

144
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,830
What do you do?

145
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,700
I don't know anything except studying.

146
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,630
I'm applying for a position
in a chemical lab

147
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,700
at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

148
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,180
I'm still waiting for news.

149
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,750
I was anxious these past two days,

150
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,780
so I came out to fish.

151
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,820
The Chinese Academy of Sciences.

152
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,060
I'm in awe.

153
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,060
The result hasn't come out yet.

154
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,470
In my eyes,

155
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,350
researchers are potential
Nobel Prize winners.

156
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,820
How's it going?

157
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,780
Are you still single?

158
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,780
Right now,

159
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,270
I'm just thinking about the job,

160
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,110
nothing else.

161
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,230
How about you?

162
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
Me?

163
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,110
I just gained weight.

164
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
If only the stock market
were like my weight,

165
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,870
so it would only go up, never down.

166
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,940
Everyone would be happy about it.

167
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,190
I'll help you.

168
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,270
How can I let a guest do it?

169
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,630
You two go ahead and chat.

170
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,390
We can make it quicker.

171
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,830
Okay.

172
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,440
Are these dishes to be washed?

173
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,310
Yes.

174
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,420
Did she ask you to evaluate me?

175
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,580
She trusts those she chooses.

176
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,940
She doesn't care

177
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,150
whose opinion it is

178
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,230
unless you care.

179
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Of course, I want everyone's approval.

180
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,990
I always feel

181
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,540
I'm not good enough for her.

182
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,030
I've figured it out.

183
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,780
You're like Jiang Taigong fishing.

184
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,180
Whether you catch the fish
doesn't matter.

185
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,180
You're here to enjoy the scenery,

186
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,230
to relax.

187
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,470
Fishing is really relaxing.

188
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,630
I didn't realize it before,

189
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,270
but later I found

190
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,180
this activity really suits me.

191
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,350
Let's do it together when we have time.

192
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,580
Okay. My car's here.

193
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,700
Last time your sister came along.

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,540
How's she doing now?

195
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,420
She's graduated from graduate school

196
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,380
and stayed in Shanghai.

197
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,230
She'll probably settle down
and start a family there.

198
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,830
That's great.

199
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,940
I'm very happy to see you today.

200
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
I'm really happy too.

201
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,510
Happier than catching a rainbow trout.

202
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,300
Well, I'll be going now.

203
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,020
Keep in touch.

204
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,900
Okay.

205
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,660
I'm leaving.

206
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,070
Bye-bye.

207
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,500
Tastes good.

208
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,700
Are the dishes not enough?

209
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,870
I'll cook more.

210
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,030
- No, no, it's enough.
- It's enough, enough.

211
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,900
The food you made is so delicious.

212
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,820
We couldn't waste it.

213
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,760
Since you're done,

214
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,470
why don't you two go upstairs and chat?

215
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
I'll tidy up a bit.

216
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,550
Let me help you.

217
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,900
No, nobody needs to lift a finger.

218
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,900
I'll do it myself.

219
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,590
Go ahead.

220
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,510
Okay. Let's go upstairs then.

221
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,870
Thank you.

222
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,070
No problem.

223
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,820
Can you objectively
evaluate him this time?

224
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,660
I want

225
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,660
to objectively evaluate you.

226
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,110
You don't need to do anything now.

227
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,990
- Really?
- Of course.

228
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,700
Now I see why you thought we were alike.

229
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,030
He's just like me.

230
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,420
Insecure,

231
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,110
so extremely sensitive.

232
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,900
We always try to perfect ourselves

233
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,540
before others can criticize us.

234
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,300
But his insecurity
makes him gentle, caring,

235
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,740
and understanding towards you.

236
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,620
I can't do that.

237
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,500
Su,

238
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,150
you're actually very gentle.

239
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,870
Come on.

240
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,510
How are you doing lately?

241
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,310
Pretty good.

242
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,380
(Hetang Yuese)

243
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,660
You're online.

244
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,060
(Hetang Yuese)
Are you going fishing next weekend?

245
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,900
Yes.

246
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,180
Let's meet at the usual spot.

247
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,340
(Hetang Yuese)

248
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,350
Okay. Let's take a photo together.

249
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,510
Everyone, be happy.

250
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,610
Ready?

251
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
Three,

252
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
two,

253
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,310
one.

254
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,900
Congratulations on graduating!

255
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,940
I want us to hug together.

256
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,610
I recommended you to Mr. He,
chief editor at the publishing house.

257
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,110
He heard about your grades

258
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,780
and wanted you to report immediately.

259
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,060
Thank you.

260
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,660
They don't have any
budgeted posts available this year.

261
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,300
Can you accept an unbudgeted one?

262
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,310
No problem.

263
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,900
This job is
a learning opportunity anyway.

264
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,470
I plan to work and study

265
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,990
to be a certified
counseling psychologist.

266
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,110
I knew it.

267
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,990
You were never one for comfort.

268
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,140
Let's go.

269
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,390
You didn't pay attention to P.E. classes
when you were a kid, right?

270
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,270
You can't just use your arm.

271
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,190
You have to use your waist.

272
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,510
Like this or like this.

273
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,270
This is my first time with lure fishing.

274
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,900
You reel it in first.

275
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,350
Ready?

276
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,460
Hold it firmly.

277
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,460
You see?

278
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,060
Ready? One, two, three.

279
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,710
- Reel it in.
- It's quite far.

280
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,470
Yes, like this.

281
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,430
You see? Your hand can...

282
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,580
No, don't hold it so high.

283
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,470
Lower it a bit.

284
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,430
Then reel in the line.

285
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,230
While reeling it in,

286
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,580
lift the rod

287
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,420
like this or like this.

288
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,620
It's quite interesting.

289
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,750
You practice first.

290
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,660
I...

291
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,990
I'll be right back.

292
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,140
I got it!

293
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,270
Zhenhua!

294
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,750
I made it!

295
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,900
What's wrong?

296
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
I got it. I got it.

297
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,140
What's wrong?

298
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,910
- The line's stuck a bit.
- Here, let me.

299
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,980
It's fine.

300
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,750
Yes.

301
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,660
It's quite big.

302
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,860
- Got lucky.
- Right.

303
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,870
Well.

304
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,470
This fish is heavy.

305
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,870
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,710
You've been helping me all day,

307
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,820
so you got nothing.

308
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
This fish is for you.

309
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,230
No, it's your first time with lure fishing,

310
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,430
so it would taste best.

311
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,190
Steamed sea bass is delicious.

312
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,140
I don't know how to cook it.

313
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,750
It's very simple.

314
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,270
Remove the scales and guts.
Wash it clean.

315
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,610
Make diagonal cuts on both sides.

316
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,530
Add shredded green onions
and ginger slices.

317
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,990
Steam for ten minutes in boiling water.

318
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,620
Then drizzle with soy sauce

319
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,540
and finally with hot oil.

320
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,510
That's it.

321
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,950
Why don't you come to my place?
Let's eat together.

322
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,140
Xiaohe,

323
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,270
actually, I...

324
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,100
- I...
- Do you have plans tonight?

325
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,070
No,

326
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,420
I...

327
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,910
Would it be convenient for you?

328
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,110
Sure.

329
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,030
I no longer live with my parents.

330
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,270
I rented a place in Haidian.

331
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,180
I...

332
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,190
You're Huang Yimei, right?

333
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
Please have a seat.

334
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,980
I thought

335
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,190
students in your major

336
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,710
wanted to become psychologists.

337
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,540
My experience is not enough for that.

338
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,100
And psychology in China started late.

339
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,710
I also want to access

340
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,230
the latest foreign literature.

341
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,670
So, this is the best choice for you now.

342
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,140
The job about academic books

343
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,190
require a professional background

344
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,230
and foreign language skills.

345
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,340
Your qualifications are suitable,

346
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,300
but you're a fresh graduate

347
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,470
without work experience in this area.

348
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
I'm a quicker learner.

349
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,380
I believe that.

350
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,270
Professor Wang called me

351
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,780
and praised you highly.

352
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,340
So, if there's no problem,

353
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,830
let's start today.

354
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,830
By the way, Mr. He,

355
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,750
may I ask

356
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,030
if our publishing house

357
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,470
only produces physical books?

358
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,990
That's how it is at the moment.

359
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,420
Why?

360
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Any concerns?

361
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
In the coming years,

362
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,230
e-books will occupy a large market space.

363
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,470
I was wondering

364
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,910
if we should consider this business area.

365
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,700
Alright.

366
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,540
We can talk about it later.

367
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,870
Okay.

368
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,820
Come on, I'll show you to your workspace.

369
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,750
This is our office area.

370
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,190
Let me introduce you.

371
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,750
Our new colleague, Huang Yimei.

372
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,230
- This is Liu.
- Hello. Hello.

373
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,070
Hello. Hello.

374
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,620
- Zhu.
- Hello.

375
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,580
This is your workspace.

376
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,660
Do you like it?

377
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,310
Absolutely.

378
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,030
Thank you, Mr. He.

379
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,350
No problem.

380
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,230
Traveling for so many days
must be tiring.

381
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,270
It's okay.

382
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,270
Have some water.

383
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,860
You've been in Shanghai for so many days.

384
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,780
I guess you must be
craving something spicy.

385
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,340
A hot pot or boiled fish?

386
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,230
I'll make a reservation.

387
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,980
No, not hungry.

388
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,860
Am I that charming to eat?

389
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,910
Do you want to eat me instead?

390
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,230
You're crazy.

391
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,620
I recently discovered

392
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,430
a great way to lose weight.

393
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,100
Look at yourself in the mirror
while eating.

394
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,230
When you want to eat more,

395
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,750
seeing how fat you look in the mirror

396
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,540
disgusts you, so you'd stop.

397
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,300
This method varies from person to person.

398
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,270
You're so thin.

399
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,060
If you look in the mirror,
you'd eat more.

400
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,420
That's why when we eat together,

401
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,630
the more you eat, the thinner you get,

402
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,430
and the fatter I get.

403
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,780
Why are you so excited today?

404
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,990
- Really?
- Yes.

405
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,430
So, seeing you excites me.

406
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,620
I'm happy.

407
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,950
Have you decided what to eat?

408
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,140
Let's go to your place.

409
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,230
I have something to tell you.

410
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,820
What's the matter?
Why do you have to wait?

411
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,230
Stop that and sit down.

412
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,100
So serious.

413
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,460
This is for you.

414
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,060
Why give me a gift?

415
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,270
It's not a special occasion.

416
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,700
Pajamas.

417
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,660
Do you like them?

418
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,860
Of course, I like anything you give me.

419
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,230
They're not for now.

420
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,350
They're for when you

421
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,100
stay in my place in the future.

422
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,620
Though I bought the house,

423
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,300
you're still my boyfriend.

424
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,510
When I move in,

425
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,340
of course, I'd consider you.

426
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,990
I'll also consider your opinions

427
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,140
on decorating the house.

428
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,190
During these days apart,

429
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,510
I've carefully considered
our relationship.

430
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,140
I'm cautious

431
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,060
with people

432
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,710
and particularly hate those relationships

433
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,540
full of torment and strife.

434
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,430
You're right.

435
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,820
I'm making backup plans.

436
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,540
Buying a house is a big deal,

437
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,230
and I didn't notify you in advance.

438
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,910
I didn't consider your feelings.

439
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,340
I saw Yimei in Shanghai

440
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,270
living with Fang Xiewen

441
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,100
in such a small, old house.

442
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,060
That's a cramped

443
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,990
but lively life,

444
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,620
with a hint of cat smell.

445
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,030
Suddenly, I thought

446
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,670
it's quite nice.

447
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,190
So, I don't mind

448
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,380
having your presence in my future home.

449
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,860
Are you giving me a chance
to mark my territory

450
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,860
in your new house?

451
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,110
Before,

452
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,470
I never thought

453
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,710
about letting others into my life,

454
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,670
but this time,

455
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,510
I want to give it a try.

456
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,260
(MMS: Bai Xiaohe,
Title: Steamed Sea Bass, Image:)

457
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,190
What's wrong? Is something up?

458
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,750
Why don't you go and handle it first?

459
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,950
It's nothing, really.

460
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,270
I'll go with you.

461
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,030
Quality Assurance has passed

462
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,580
(Focus on This Stage)
the Edition 2.3 testing.

463
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,790
Next week,

464
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,750
we'll be installing and testing

465
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,710
on the client's test server.

466
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,310
Zhou?

467
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,070
Zhou?

468
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,190
Redo the test this week

469
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,210
and encrypt and burn
the final version onto a disc.

470
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,380
Okay, got it.

471
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,350
If there are no questions,

472
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,380
go ahead and get ready.

473
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,110
Go.

474
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,940
Zhou.

475
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,220
Fang.

476
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,030
Did you get what was just said?

477
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,230
I did.

478
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Is there something wrong?

479
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,190
My mom is sick.

480
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,190
I've been working overtime recently

481
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,710
to prepare the release version.

482
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,910
I want to take some time off,

483
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,910
but I can't seem to get away.

484
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,100
Finish this test,

485
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,820
and I'll take care of the rest.

486
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,070
You go home.

487
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,380
Fang, I...

488
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,350
Get back to work.

489
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,310
Anyone home?

490
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,470
Is anyone home?

491
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,830
Madam.

492
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,420
Huang, you're back.

493
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,620
I'm looking for Fang.

494
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,700
Seems like he's not home.

495
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,990
Right, he's working overtime.

496
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,140
What's wrong?

497
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,140
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

498
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,990
No need.

499
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,060
He's busy.
What don't you tell me instead?

500
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,540
Is the lease almost up?

501
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,820
Both of us want to renew the lease.

502
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,620
I'll talk to Fang about it later.

503
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,230
You're not very good with these things.

504
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,670
He's been working overtime lately.

505
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,820
You can't catch him.

506
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,750
No rush, no rush.

507
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,300
Look, we rented this place together.

508
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,270
He always handled these matters.

509
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,740
I want to share some of that burden.

510
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,460
Alright then.

511
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
For over three years,

512
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,580
you've been sharing
half the rent with me.

513
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,510
Why?

514
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,580
I thought you might not rent here

515
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,710
if you found a cheaper place.

516
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,820
You didn't even buy a bicycle,

517
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,190
but you've spent over 20,000
helping me with rent.

518
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,670
What else are you hiding from me?

519
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,100
George Morandi.

520
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,710
That time we went to the art exhibition,

521
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,780
you mentioned George Morandi.

522
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,780
When I got back, I looked him up.

523
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,820
His works

524
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,430
match this color scheme.

525
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,140
You painted this wall?

526
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,380
Yes.

527
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,270
You arranged this house?

528
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,060
If I said I liked Da Vinci,

529
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,580
would you paint me a Mona Lisa?

530
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,470
That's too hard.

531
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,750
I couldn't do that.

532
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,750
That day you mentioned so many artists.

533
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,580
Konstantinovich,

534
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,140
Mondrian,

535
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,660
and also

536
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,350
Kubota.

537
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,620
I looked them all up.

538
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,710
This was the simplest.

539
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,190
So you painted the wall like this

540
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,860
just so I would rent this house?

541
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,860
This house is originally narrow and dark.

542
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,230
I was afraid you wouldn't like it.

543
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,460
What else?

544
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,700
There's more.

545
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,860
I asked your classmates and found out

546
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,140
you were working at that beer house.

547
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,300
That's why I applied.

548
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,750
Rose, I didn't mean to deceive you.

549
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,990
There are just some things
I didn't tell you.

550
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,670
You scared me, Fang Xiewen.

551
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,950
You scared me.

552
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,790
If you keep this up,

553
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,300
you could sell me
and I wouldn't even know.

554
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,190
I would be helping you count the money.

555
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,030
No.

556
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,190
No, Rose, how could I ever sell you?

557
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,270
I...

558
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,100
I got really nervous around you.

559
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,670
There were so many things I couldn't say.

560
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,190
I could only use
a coder's clumsy methods,

561
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,990
using algorithms
to find a path close to you.

562
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,540
Sometimes, I might use a few

563
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,030
small programs, little tricks.

564
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,110
But I believe

565
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,340
as long as the destination is right,

566
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,430
the process of the program
doesn't matter.

567
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,710
Good talker.

568
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,110
Rose,

569
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,270
I swear,

570
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,180
I won't do this again.

571
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,470
Who would believe you?

572
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,220
Fang Xiewen,

573
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,990
really, in this world,

574
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,960
people cannot be judged
by their appearance.

575
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,060
The human heart is hard to fathom.

576
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,640
The human heart is indeed hard to fathom.

577
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,870
Goodness.

578
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,300
Rose.

579
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,230
I really...

580
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,270
I'm tired.

581
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,270
Then I...

582
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,910
I'll go downstairs and sleep.

583
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Remember to close the window.

584
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,780
Don't worry about the window.

585
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,380
And remember to drink your milk.

586
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,670
If you're not angry anymore,

587
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,620
let me know.

588
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,870
Tiny,

589
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,710
that idiot really left.

590
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,670
I'm still here.

591
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,300
Are you really stupid or pretending?

592
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,030
I...

593
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm really stupid.

594
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,350
I'm really stupid.

595
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
I'm really, really stupid.

596
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Really. Really stupid.

597
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,910
Really. I swear I'm really stupid.

598
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,780
Well, then,

599
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,030
I'll go downstairs and wash up. Okay?

600
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,630
Wait for me.

601
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,710
Let's talk later.

602
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,500
What's wrong?

603
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,310
The updated version for Rongsen Group
yesterday was wrong.

604
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,390
It overwrote their database.

605
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,220
The development team and the product manager
went over early this morning.

606
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,740
Didn't anyone call you?

607
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,630
Understood.

608
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,910
What's wrong with you?

609
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,350
What do we need you for?

610
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,220
You can't even burn a disc properly.

611
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,900
Come in.

612
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,180
After Zhou burned the disc,

613
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,770
I double-checked it myself.

614
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,430
I need to check

615
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,500
what went wrong.

616
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,430
What are you checking?

617
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,510
Rongsen called Mr. Shao.

618
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,740
Their operations

619
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,540
were interrupted for 12 hours.

620
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,510
Let me tell you both.

621
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,660
If client data

622
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,310
is lost or leaked,

623
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,990
the whole project
won't be enough for compensation.

624
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,350
Manager, I really checked it.

625
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,790
If it's not your fault,
then whose fault is it?

626
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,430
Jason, calm down.

627
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,030
I personally checked

628
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,420
the version he handed over to me.

629
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,660
Don't shift the blame now.

630
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,950
If the problem is with our team,

631
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,100
I'll take responsibility.

632
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,390
Now, the priority is
to solve the problem.

633
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,740
I'll go to Rongsen first.

634
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,870
Fang, I'm telling you.

635
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,870
I really checked it.

636
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,260
Forget about it now.
Let's go and have a look.

637
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,780
Wait for me to get something.

638
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,740
Move, move, move.

639
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,220
Could it really be my mistake?

640
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,500
Fang,

641
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,260
since my mom got sick,

642
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,700
I've been prone to getting anxious.

643
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,220
I'm worried I made a mistake

644
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,030
in my haste.

645
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,870
It shouldn't be.

646
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,390
I checked it one by one.

647
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,870
Stop thinking so much for now.

648
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,540
(Hetang Yuese)

649
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,140
I heard they just stocked 2 kilos
of new fish in that pond.

650
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,220
Want to try our luck tomorrow?

651
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,990
I have overtime tomorrow.

652
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,940
(Hetang Yuese)

653
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,310
I'm back.

654
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,500
Dinner's ready.

655
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,350
The water in the thermos is hot.

656
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,870
Be careful when you drink it.

657
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,150
What's wrong?

658
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,100
Nothing.

659
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,350
Eat quickly before it gets cold.

660
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,540
I'll make you some noodles.

661
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,180
I'm not hungry. I have work to do.

662
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,750
You eat.

663
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Mr. Shao said

664
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,660
this incident

665
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,310
caused the company huge losses.

666
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,100
Someone must take responsibility.

667
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,380
I can guarantee

668
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,310
every disc handed to you

669
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,540
was checked by me.

670
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,910
Are you saying it's my fault?

671
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,990
Mr. Shao means

672
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,900
we need to find
who's responsible for this

673
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,870
and deal with it seriously.

674
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,910
If Rongsen sees our sincerity,

675
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,030
maybe we can salvage our relationship.

676
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,940
As for

677
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,140
who gets dismissed,

678
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,180
they don't care.

679
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,180
(Manager, Development Department)

680
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,740
How's it going, Fang?

681
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,790
Nothing.

682
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,900
You're not leaving yet?

683
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,060
I'll wait for the rain to ease up a bit.

684
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,390
The forecast says it'll rain till tonight.

685
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,350
I hate rain.

686
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,750
Then I'll go.

687
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,630
Bye-bye.

688
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,020
(Resignation Letter)

689
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,830
What are you doing?

690
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,660
Didn't you understand what I meant?

691
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,990
Since we can't figure out
who caused the accident,

692
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,060
the responsibility should fall on me
as team leader.

693
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,990
Figure out what?

694
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,660
The person who burned the disc
is the main suspect.

695
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,870
There was no problem with the disc
when it came to me.

696
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,900
You...

697
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,870
Give me two days.

698
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,830
After I hand over my work,

699
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,100
you can delete my account.

00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,060
(Manager, Development Department)

701
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,750
Fang,

702
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,580
is everything okay?

703
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,750
Just keep up the good work.

704
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,750
You can do this.

705
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,790
You're back.

706
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,220
What happened?

707
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,060
How did you get soaked like this?

708
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,870
Is something wrong?
