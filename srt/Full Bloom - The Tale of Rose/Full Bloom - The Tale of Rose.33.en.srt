=Episode 33=

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,890
That day, I was drinking alcohol.

4
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,840
Well,

5
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,360
you want a kid,

6
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,470
and...

7
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,080
Do you prefer a boy or a girl?

8
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,410
A boy.

9
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,410
Boys are good.

10
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,490
(No, no.)

11
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,650
Daddy.

12
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,110
Taichu,

13
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,180
what are you doing?

14
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,140
Making breakfast.

15
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,250
Making breakfast?

16
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,600
You cooked so much.

17
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,040
Daddy, try it.

18
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,420
Let me try it.

19
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,230
So delicious.

20
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,370
You're amazing.

21
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,860
Taichu,

22
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,530
you made so many servings.

23
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,110
This one is Mommy's.

24
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,020
This is Grandma's.

25
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,560
This is Grandpa's.

26
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,500
This is Uncle's.

27
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,260
This is Auntie's.

28
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,520
This one

29
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,080
is for Nanny, right?

30
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,000
This one is for Fu Jiaming.

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,130
It's done. It's done.

32
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,990
Taichu, does Mommy

33
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,370
often take you to see Fu Jiaming?

34
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,910
He's my good friend.

35
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,230
When I go back,

36
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,960
I want to give this to Fu Jiaming.

37
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,460
Taichu,

38
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,990
can you

39
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,370
not go back to Beijing?

40
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,960
Stay in Shanghai with me, okay?

41
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,500
Why?

42
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,470
Then I won't see Mommy,

43
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,260
Grandma, Grandpa,

44
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,710
Uncle, Auntie,

45
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,490
Xini, Chun, Xuan,

46
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,000
and Fu Jiaming.

47
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,310
Taichu,

48
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,100
your mom

49
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,080
has Fu Jiaming.

50
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,520
Grandma has Grandpa.

51
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,810
Uncle has Auntie.

52
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,440
They all have someone.

53
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,810
But when you're not here,

54
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,690
I have no one.

55
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,730
In my heart,

56
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,850
you're the most important.

57
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,760
You're more important
than anyone or anything else.

58
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,980
I want to be with you

59
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,370
every second

60
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,960
and make you happy.

61
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,000
When you're not here,

62
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,610
I really miss you.

63
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,460
Taichu,

64
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,080
live with me,

65
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,080
okay?

66
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,440
My house is bigger than Grandma's house,

67
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,250
I will also buy you many toys.

68
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,050
If you like playing the piano,

69
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,320
I will buy you a piano

70
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,290
and find a piano teacher, okay?

71
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,220
Taichu,

72
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,290
I only have you now.

73
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,200
Daddy, don't cry.

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,520
Don't get in the way.

75
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,810
What are you looking at?

76
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,050
Nothing.

77
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,390
Lele.

78
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,900
Lele.

79
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you still remember me?

80
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,520
Hello, Uncle.

81
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,830
Lele,

82
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,960
how old are you?

83
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,070
Five years old.

84
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,880
You're so tall.

85
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,760
Doesn't look like five.

86
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,710
Are you actually six years old?

87
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,560
- You remembered wrong.
- I'm five.

88
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,390
Lele,

89
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,660
go home now.

90
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,900
Zhenhua?

91
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,210
Came back to see your parents?

92
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,900
I saw Lele just now,

93
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,990
so I greeted him.

94
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,610
This child is introverted.

95
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,920
I was introverted when I was a child.

96
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,070
They say sons look like their mothers.

97
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,140
Your eyes are so big.

98
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,570
His single eyelid must've taken after his dad.

99
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,250
I don't have a dad.

100
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,250
We should go home.

101
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,500
Let's go, Lele.

102
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,380
Goodbye.

103
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,450
Goodbye, Uncle.

104
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,860
Let's go.

105
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,830
Hello.

106
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,000
How's Taichu doing? Is she good?

107
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
Very well-behaved.

108
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,640
When is she coming back?
I'll pick her up at the airport.

109
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,800
Withdraw Taichu from the Beijing kindergarten.

110
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,210
I'll find a good one for her here.

111
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,580
Why?

112
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,270
In the future,

113
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,330
she'll live in Shanghai with me.

114
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,220
What?

115
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,100
You...

116
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,490
What do you mean?

117
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,190
Huang Yimei,

118
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,570
didn't I warn you

119
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,370
not to let Fu Jiaming see my daughter?

120
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,330
Did you listen to me?

121
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,950
You...

122
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,630
That didn't make any sense.

123
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,570
Why should I listen?

124
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,540
Now, her mind is full of Fu Jiaming.

125
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,260
She's always thinking about him.

126
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,130
In her heart,

127
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,800
he is even more important than me.

128
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,740
Didn't you teach her that?

129
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,450
Don't be so petty, okay?

130
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,680
Kids long for whoever's not around.

131
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
When she was here, she always talked about you.

132
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,490
You don't need to tell me these things.

133
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,040
I think you haven't taught her well.

134
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,450
Then I'll take over from now on.

135
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,280
Taichu will stay with me.

136
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,630
Fang Xiewen, let me tell you.

137
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,490
Stop this.

138
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,450
I have Taichu's custody.

139
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,900
You can't decide to keep her in Shanghai.

140
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,210
Why can't I?

141
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,490
She's my daughter.

142
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,180
(Fang Xiewen)

143
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,180
(Rose)

144
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,820
(Fang Xiewen)

145
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,700
Hello?

146
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,070
Uncle Bai,

147
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,090
are you busy?

148
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,790
Huang,

149
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,430
I'm free.

150
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,270
What's up?

151
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,750
You're my major shareholder,

152
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,780
so I need to update you

153
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,000
from time to time about work.

154
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,970
I trust you.

155
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,610
No need for updates on daily work.

156
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,070
Besides,

157
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,880
don't I have someone handling finances for me?

158
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,020
Oh, Uncle Bai,

159
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,880
Xiaohe has returned.

160
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,830
Yeah, she's back this year

161
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,800
and has gone back to school.

162
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,430
Why?

163
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,400
Have you two met?

164
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,940
We bumped into each other in the courtyard.

165
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,330
Great.

166
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,210
I see the kid has grown up.

167
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,550
Well.

168
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,570
What does her husband do?

169
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,760
Well...

170
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,760
You two can talk about that when you meet.

171
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,850
Okay.

172
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,780
Uncle Bai, it's nothing.

173
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,370
I'll come to see you.

174
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,580
Talk to you later.

175
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,830
Goodbye.

176
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,680
He let us talk ourselves?

177
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
(Bai Xiaohe)

178
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,300
(Rose)

179
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,610
Rose, what's wrong?

180
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,860
Zhenhua,

181
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,640
Fang Xiewen called me.

182
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,160
He told me to cancel the kindergarten here.

183
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,640
He won't let Taichu come back.

184
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,340
What?

185
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,830
Where are you?

186
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm on my way home.

187
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,730
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

188
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,880
Still can't reach him?

189
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,400
He's not answering calls.

190
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,850
The company can't find him.

191
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,150
What a jerk.

192
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,730
Taking the child to Shanghai.

193
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,110
It's not deceiving, right?

194
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,280
Isn't it more like kidnapping?

195
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,680
Let's call the police.

196
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,880
No, I have to go there.

197
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,020
Don't tell Dad and Mom for now, okay?

198
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,860
Anyway,

199
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,520
find a way to stall for a couple of days.

200
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,670
No, no, no.

201
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,730
Rose, let me go.

202
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,260
I can't give birth,
but I can fight for the child.

203
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,160
With Fu Jiaming like this, you can't leave.

204
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,000
Taichu is my daughter.

205
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,940
But if this escalates,

206
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
what should Taichu do?

207
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,740
Will she have to choose between Mom and Dad?

208
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,040
I can't think of that.

209
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,250
You know what Fang is like.

210
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,040
He's now holding Taichu,

211
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,400
just like he controlled me back then.

212
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,700
No, no. I have to go to Shanghai.

213
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,450
Rose, calm down.

214
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,800
Dad often says many historical events
stem from impulsive actions.

215
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,900
Think about it.

216
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,180
What does it mean for Fang to hold Taichu?

217
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,830
He's trying to make you go to Shanghai.

218
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,230
He wants to provoke you face-to-face.

219
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,250
Once you fall out, there's no turning back.

220
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,470
You're too involved to see this.

221
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,730
Leave this to me.

222
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,830
Send me his address.

223
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,680
I'll go right now.

224
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,850
If there's a problem, I'll call you.

225
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,680
Don't worry.

226
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,860
I'm going.

227
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,980
Hello, Mr. Fang.

228
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,400
Mr. Fang, that person is here again.

229
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,450
Mr. Fang is here.

230
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,140
Ran away fast yesterday.

231
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,830
Looks like you've done
plenty of shady business.

232
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,040
Skilled at dodging.

233
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,700
By the way,

234
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,230
your staff here are quite good,

235
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,400
loyal to you.

236
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,870
Not a single person told me

237
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,310
where you're living now.

238
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,490
For this, you should give them a raise.

239
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,370
- The boss should...
- Don't chat here with me.

240
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,640
Let Huang Yimei come over

241
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,920
to talk about the custody again.

242
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,150
Rose has handed this matter

243
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,780
over to me.

244
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,630
If you don't let me see the child,

245
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,250
I'll have to keep stalling here.

246
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,030
Anyway, with my laptop,

247
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,880
I can handle remote work.

248
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,500
You...

249
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,880
The coffee you made for me yesterday

250
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,850
was good. Make me another cup.

251
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,380
Please.

252
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,500
Then get back to work.

253
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,090
Later, I'll ask your boss to give you a raise.

254
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
I've met him.

255
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,210
The talk went well.

256
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,370
He said he'll consider it.

257
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,950
In a few days,

258
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,680
I should be able to bring Taichu back.

259
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,910
Zhou.

260
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,900
Don't worry. Take good care of Jiaming.

261
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,070
Finish up the engine part of this game.

262
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,390
Okay. Bye now.

263
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,500
Refine it further.

264
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,340
Sure.

265
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,700
Right.

266
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,070
Okay.

267
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,090
Good.

268
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,210
Mr. Fang,

269
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,330
since everyone's here,

270
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,310
would you like to share with everyone

271
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,700
how you managed to deceive my niece

272
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,850
into coming to Shanghai?

273
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,870
Mr. Fang, today, a client

274
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,850
wants to visit our server room
and operations office.

275
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,520
If he's around,

276
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,030
then...

277
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,030
I see.

278
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,550
Go on.

279
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,480
I'll call the police.

280
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
Call the police?

281
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,960
Sure.

282
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,240
I want to call the police too.

283
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,950
My niece has gone missing.

284
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,200
I have evidence that you kidnapped her.

285
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,610
If this big boss were arrested,

286
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,910
can the company still function?

287
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,160
She's my daughter.

288
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,060
It's natural for her to live with me.

289
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,370
Let me tell you one last time.

290
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,060
Let her mother come find me.

291
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,900
Fang Xiewen,

292
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,580
when you divorced,

293
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,820
your mother said girls are worthless

294
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,200
and urged you to send my sister
and Taichu back to Beijing.

295
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,030
Since your family values males over females,

296
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,850
why did you snatch Taichu over?

297
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,060
I didn't snatch her.

298
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,440
Your mother said at that time

299
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,920
you'd have a son right after the divorce.

300
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,400
How come it hasn't happened yet?

301
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,480
Could it be that you have a problem?

302
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,440
You should see an andrologist.

303
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,990
Fang, Fang.

304
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,340
- Mr. Fang.
- Mr. Fang, don't.

305
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
- Fang, Fang.
- Mr. Fang.

306
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,180
Don't, don't.

307
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,960
Officer,

308
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,530
I've been beaten,

309
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,240
and this person has also kidnapped a child.

310
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,640
Why are you here?

311
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,290
You've called for reinforcements.

312
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,530
Fang Xiewen, wait a moment.

313
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,580
Let me see.

314
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm fine.

315
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,400
Wait in the car for me.

316
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,270
Stay here.

317
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,810
What do you have to say?

318
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm saying the same thing again.

319
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,500
Except for Huang Yimei,

320
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,960
none of you can solve this.

321
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,240
The police just said

322
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm the father.

323
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,200
Taking the child home

324
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,340
is not illegal.

325
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,010
This is a family dispute.

326
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,710
Yes.

327
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,790
I admit.

328
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,540
When we divorced,

329
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,400
I was under the greatest pressure.

330
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,290
I couldn't take care of Taichu.

331
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,060
Now, the conditions I can provide Taichu

332
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,670
are much better than what Huang Yimei can.

333
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,160
Taichu should be with me.

334
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,200
Please tell Huang Yimei

335
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,440
I've already found a lawyer.

336
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,880
Regarding custody of the child,

337
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,720
we need to renegotiate.

338
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,880
Do you love Fang Taichu?

339
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,380
Of course.

340
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,960
You can give her more financially,

341
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,680
but how much time can you spend with her?

342
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,150
My mom will move to Shanghai.

343
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,640
She's hardly seen Nanny since birth.

344
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,920
To her, Nanny is like a stranger.

345
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,950
You know yourself

346
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,230
how your mom treats her.

347
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,770
Do you really think this is the best for her?

348
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,610
Snatching her to your side

349
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,050
and giving her to someone

350
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,230
she doesn't know?

351
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,050
Your mom doesn't even like her.

352
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,780
She won't see her own family, friends,

353
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,720
or playmates her age.

354
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,610
Will she truly be happy?

355
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,150
Fang Xiewen, this isn't love.

356
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,640
You're controlling her,

357
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,050
just like you controlled Huang Yimei back then.

358
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,230
I...

359
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,580
You want to be extremely important,

360
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,910
supreme,

361
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,860
even the only one

362
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,950
in their hearts.

363
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,130
But is that possible?

364
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,530
Is it realistic?

365
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,580
Huang Yimei is an adult with her own opinions.

366
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,710
She has awakened

367
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,910
and freed herself from your control.

368
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,340
You're transferring that desire for control

369
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,010
onto your daughter.

370
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,720
She's only five years old.

371
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,750
You're forcing her

372
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,540
to choose between her mom and dad.

373
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,160
How do you think she'll feel?

374
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,200
When she grows up

375
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,100
and has her own thoughts,

376
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,300
do you think she'll thank you

377
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,190
for taking her away

378
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,050
from her mother?

379
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,230
Really, Fang Xiewen.

380
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,570
Think carefully about what love is.

381
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,090
If you really love your daughter,

382
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,530
what should you do?

383
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,620
Let's go.

384
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,620
The ice bucket you asked for.

385
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,070
Thank you.

386
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,030
You're welcome.

387
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,090
Why did you have to provoke him?

388
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,390
Was it necessary to take those punches?

389
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,400
Yes.

390
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,160
I'll go get checked tomorrow morning.

391
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,300
If they're classified as a minor wound,

392
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,380
he'll be detained.

393
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,050
He could get a sentence of a year.

394
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,960
With this, it might just be enough

395
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,010
for a slight bodily injury.

396
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,190
Then he'll be detained for a few days.

397
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,230
If he's detained,

398
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,330
Taichu can come back.

399
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,810
Using such tactics,

400
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,880
have you considered your niece's feelings?

401
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,850
When parents fall out,

402
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,010
won't it affect the child?

403
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,710
If he wants to fight for custody,

404
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,820
what we need to do

405
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,530
is find a reliable lawyer for Rose,

406
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,910
consult clearly,

407
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,200
and prepare for the lawsuit.

408
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,140
In the end, Rose needs to go

409
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,740
and see Fang Xiewen herself.

410
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,610
They are Taichu's parents.

411
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,440
You're right.

412
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,290
I was impulsive.

413
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,020
Anyway, I talked to Fang Xiewen.

414
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,810
I don't know if he'll listen,

415
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,950
but I'm sure

416
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,480
he loves his child.

417
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,530
It depends on whether he

418
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,230
can figure out

419
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,870
what kind of life is best for the child.

420
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,190
He'd better figure it out.

421
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,810
If not, I'll deal with him forcefully.

422
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,670
Actually,

423
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,720
I can understand him.

424
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,860
He's successful in his career now,

425
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,400
but still lacking emotional comfort.

426
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,570
He wants to be good to his child,

427
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,290
but he's using the wrong methods.

428
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,830
That's true.

429
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,500
These two families have only one kid.

430
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,850
Taichu is a treasure.

431
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,880
What if we had a child?

432
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,050
You want a child too?

433
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,570
Who else wants it?

434
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,090
I do. I want a child.

435
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,680
Didn't I tell you

436
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,780
two years ago?

437
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,770
There's no follow-up.

438
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,960
Do you really want a kid?

439
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm going to take a shower.

440
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,470
Jia Yufeng was pleased with the music

441
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,140
you did for his work

442
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,300
"Humidity Ten Percent",

443
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,240
especially the underwater part.

444
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,820
This time, he brought

445
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,530
a new piece for us to exhibit together.

446
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,740
It's this one.

447
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,230
What do you think about this?

448
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,090
Any inspiration?

449
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,480
It feels okay.

450
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,510
Hello?

451
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,240
Alright, got it.

452
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,480
I need to go to Shanghai.

453
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,900
What's wrong?

454
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,810
Didn't your lawyer

455
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,770
come with you?

456
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,960
Didn't your brother find a lawyer for you?

457
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,620
Fang,

458
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,610
after all these years, why bother?

459
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,880
I don't agree about you
keeping Taichu in Shanghai

460
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,300
without my consent,

461
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,720
but I understand

462
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,200
you're protecting our child in your way.

463
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,470
Despite our differences in parenting,

464
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,680
our intentions are good.

465
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,920
I hope you can understand me too.

466
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,610
You're busy with your love life.

467
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,190
You hardly have time for our child.

468
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,640
Why don't you ask Taichu

469
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,050
if I've ever neglected her?

470
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,640
Have I ever let her feel left out?

471
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,190
But still, I thank you

472
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,950
for taking good care of Taichu

473
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,130
during this time.

474
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,680
Both of us are first-time parents,

475
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,530
learning as we go.

476
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,670
When we encounter differences,

477
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,950
we should discuss

478
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,060
rather than blame each other.

479
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,710
How does that benefit our child?

480
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,570
She will be the one who gets hurt.

481
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,580
Taichu is so young,

482
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,850
shuttling between two cities,

483
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,440
unable to see both parents at the same time.

484
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,160
This situation is our doing.

485
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,130
If we want to make it up to Taichu,

486
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,920
we need to solve it together.

487
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,920
How do you plan to resolve this?

488
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,100
I'm willing to renegotiate

489
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,240
custody with you.

490
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,720
As long as it's for the child's benefit,

491
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,160
any condition can be discussed.

492
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,240
With our abilities,

493
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,340
I'm sure we can work out

494
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,640
a feasible solution.

495
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,140
If you're worried,

496
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,570
you can bring a lawyer into this.

497
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,610
What about your lawyer?

498
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,090
I don't need a lawyer.

499
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,400
I thought

500
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,440
meeting you this time

501
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,810
would be a battle.

502
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,290
I did consider rushing to Shanghai

503
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,290
and taking the child away no matter what,

504
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,130
but then I calmed down and thought

505
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,770
kindness might be better than hostility.

506
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,880
We've been through so much together.

507
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,480
Though our marriage didn't end perfectly,

508
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,480
having such a lovely daughter

509
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,570
proves everything was worth it.

510
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,850
Can I see her?

511
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,720
I really miss her.

512
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,290
She misses you too.

513
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,960
Your complexion

514
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,570
doesn't look great.

515
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,570
Are you tired recently?

516
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,100
It's alright.

517
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,180
How's he doing?

518
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,420
Not too well.

519
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,160
Did I cause you

520
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,680
a lot of trouble?

521
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,180
Fang,

522
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,610
between us,

523
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,370
there's no such thing.

524
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,530
Is this for me?

525
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,160
Thank you.

526
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,570
What else?

527
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,960
You've given all to me.

528
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,950
Then what will you eat?

529
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,530
I'll cook something else.

530
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,920
First...

531
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,640
Taichu.

532
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,440
Mommy, why are you here?

533
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,440
I missed you, so I came to see you.

534
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,260
Xiaoyu, thank you.

535
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,300
No problem.

536
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,680
Mr. Fang, I'll take my leave now.

537
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,860
Sure.

538
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,530
Looks great. You're even more beautiful.

539
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,910
Mommy, look at the new dress from Daddy.

540
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,330
It's so pretty!

541
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,090
Do you miss me?

542
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,200
Yes.

543
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,330
Daddy also said

544
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,260
milk is nutritious.

545
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,630
As long as I drink it every day,

546
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,810
he'll reward me with lots of toys.

547
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,850
Look how good Daddy is to you.

548
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,530
You should care more about Daddy.

549
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,720
Can you stay with Daddy for a while longer?

550
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,720
I have a task for you.

551
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,230
Make sure Daddy

552
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,990
eats and sleeps on time,

553
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,850
no staying up late.

554
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,330
Take Daddy for a walk at night.

555
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,770
Can you do that?

556
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,790
Pinky promise.

557
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,090
Taichu, you're amazing!

558
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,420
You're amazing!

559
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,340
What is it?

560
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,140
I took the six hormone tests

561
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,300
and anti-mullerian hormone checks.

562
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,640
(Reproductive Medical Center)
I have no problems at my age.

563
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,740
Why did you check

564
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,850
before we have even tried?

565
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,880
I get it.

566
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,960
You're treating this like a project.

567
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,810
Risk assessment, making plans.

568
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,300
Do we need to budget for this too?

569
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,230
If you're free tomorrow, go get checked.

570
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,190
If everything's fine,

571
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,990
we can start next month.

572
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,050
There's no way I could have a problem.

573
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,530
So confident, huh?

574
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,990
It's not that.

575
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,340
Goji berries.

576
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,510
I've eaten tons of goji berries.

577
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,770
I've been ready for a long time.

578
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,190
Let's not wait until next month.

579
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,300
Let's try today.

580
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,060
No. Ovulation is in two days.

581
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,030
It won't make a difference.

582
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,580
Stop it, stop it.

583
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,200
Hold on for better quality.

584
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,790
Don't move.

585
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,240
Wait until you're calm.

586
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,530
Oh, my god.

587
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,770
(Liu Zhiming)
In Beijing, there's Doctor Yao,

588
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,090
one of the top cardiac specialists in China.

589
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,880
It's hard to get an appointment with him.

590
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,050
I've already asked this friend

591
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,330
to arrange it for you.

592
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,850
When you get back, call him.

593
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,230
He'll arrange everything for you.

594
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,130
Set a time.

595
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,480
Go to the hospital and find Doctor Yao.

596
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,540
I heard

597
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,400
Doctor Yao is going abroad next week,

598
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,720
and he's only available this week.

599
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,640
Contact him as soon as possible.

600
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,400
Take your boyfriend to see him.

601
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,610
Why are you helping him?

602
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,810
Helping him is helping you, isn't it?

603
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,130
Helping you

604
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,850
is helping my daughter, right?

605
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,190
Since I have these connections,

606
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,030
why not use them?

607
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,500
Unexpectedly...

608
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,640
Unexpectedly, I'd be so righteous.

609
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,470
Right?

610
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,860
Seriously,

611
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm sorry

612
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,640
for always causing you trouble.

613
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,290
Consider it making up

614
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,240
for past mistakes.

615
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,960
Thank you.

616
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,590
Jiaming.

617
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,460
You're back.

618
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,280
There's something I need to discuss with you.

619
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,580
(Bai Xiaohe)

620
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,860
(Bai Xiaohe)

621
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,900
(May 8, 2013)

622
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,720
May 8th.

623
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,090
We did it

624
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,010
in September

625
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,720
or October.

626
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,760
So it should be June. Not right.

627
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,320
Could have been premature.

628
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
(Huang Zhenhua: Forgive me for asking.
Are you divorced?)

629
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,180
(Bai Xiaohe: I'm single.)

630
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,490
What answer is that?

631
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,050
What are you muttering about?

632
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,310
Do you need something?

633
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,860
Nothing.

634
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,130
I've made an appointment for tomorrow.

635
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,130
I'll go with you.

636
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,570
Thank your friend for me.

637
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,760
This disease

638
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,680
has been with me my whole life.

639
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,720
Every doctor says pretty much the same thing.

640
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,840
Doctor Yao is the best cardiac doctor in China.

641
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,130
Maybe he can find a way to cure you completely.

642
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,530
Do you want me to go?

643
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,930
You said you wanted to live
like a normal person,

644
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,130
to be my normal boyfriend.

645
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,200
I think this is a chance.

646
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,270
I understand.

647
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,020
I'll go.

648
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,970
Does he look like me?

649
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,900
Look at the eyes.

650
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,890
Single eyelid, small eyes.

651
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,020
Does his mouth look like Bai Xiaohe's?

652
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,160
The nose looks like Bai Xiaohe's too.

653
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,360
Aren't those our genes?

654
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,050
Do this pose.

655
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,790
But she didn't say anything.

656
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,800
How do you know he's yours?

657
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,930
She didn't say anything,

658
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,430
but why does she always evade questions

659
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,610
about the child's father?

660
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,490
Doesn't that seem suspicious?

661
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,640
How can you not remember anything

662
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,570
about such a big event?

663
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,010
Do you think it's possible

664
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,680
that she did something to your drink?

665
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,640
She studied chemistry.

666
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,970
No, no, no.

667
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,890
If the child is yours,

668
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,640
what will you do?

669
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,230
How about this?

670
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,020
Let's start with a detailed examination.

671
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,570
After the results come out,

672
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,410
we will discuss the treatment plan.

673
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,900
Alright?

674
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,340
Thank you.

675
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,380
Okay.

676
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,640
These are the images you provided

677
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,050
from the last surgery and CT scan.

678
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,840
These are from this time.

679
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,130
Comparing them, you can clearly see

680
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,970
the severe damage

681
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,420
to the left ventricle

682
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,890
and adhesions at the site

683
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,050
of the previous surgery.

684
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,490
Currently,

685
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,720
surgery is no longer feasible.

686
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,200
Are you saying he can't have surgery?

687
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,010
The chance of success

688
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,320
is very low.

689
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,720
I don't recommend it.

690
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,390
I believe no doctor in China

691
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,970
would dare to operate on him either.

692
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,680
Even with foreign equipment,

693
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,130
I'm afraid we can't guarantee it.

694
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,230
Then...

695
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,490
Then how can we treat him?

696
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,450
There's no use doing that.

697
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,500
You should

698
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,200
prepare for the worst.

699
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,750
Doctor,

700
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,840
how much time does he have?

701
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,200
Not optimistic.

702
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,900
Six months?

703
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,280
Sorry.

704
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,800
Three months?

705
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,890
Anytime.

706
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,160
What you can do now

707
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,530
is try to minimize

708
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,760
any regrets for him.

709
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,670
Jiaming,

710
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,200
I'm back.

711
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,900
