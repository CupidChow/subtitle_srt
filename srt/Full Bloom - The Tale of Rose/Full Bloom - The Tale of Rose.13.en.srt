2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Rose?

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
Hello?

5
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,100
(On call with Mom)
Rose?

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,960
Rose?

7
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,260
(On call with Mom)
Rose? What's wrong?

8
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,210
Say something.

9
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,180
What did she say?

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
No sound.

11
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,820
Call her back.

12
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,980
(Mom, incoming call)

13
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,550
She didn't answer.

14
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,770
Call her again.

15
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,420
(11 new messages, 8 missed calls)

16
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,300
(From Mom: Rose, what's wrong?)
Rose,

17
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,050
(Talk to me, dear. I'm worried.)
I don't know what happened.

18
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,930
(I'm really worried about you.)
Whatever you want to do,

19
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,900
(Don't scare me, okay? I'm so anxious.)
we support you.

20
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,020
(Have you encountered some trouble?)

21
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,140
Be it romance

22
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,610
or work-related,

23
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,220
ups and downs are inevitable.

24
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,120
No matter what,

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,050
don't harm yourself.

26
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,260
In the middle of the night,

27
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,330
you called your mom to disturb her.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,500
Were you scolded by your boss

29
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,170
or did you have a fight
with your boyfriend?

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,940
Do you know how worried
your mom was last night?

31
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,870
She called you but you didn't answer.

32
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,720
She spent ages

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,960
studying the manual on how to text you.

34
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,680
Alright, she is upset.

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,710
Stop that.

36
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,730
She deserves it, doesn't she?

37
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,840
She slept soundly after calling,

38
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,730
but you stayed up all night.

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,620
You've never made things easy

40
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,730
for your mom since you were a child.

41
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,730
We're getting old.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,700
We can't handle such scares.

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,050
If your mom falls ill,

44
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,380
I won't forgive you.

45
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
And you.

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,450
What kind of lousy phone
did you buy your mom?

47
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,450
It doesn't even have handwriting input.

48
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,050
Then I'll buy her a new one.

49
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,090
No need. Don't listen to your dad.

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,970
Let's all calm down for a while,

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,380
eat, and then we'll talk.

52
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,750
Calm down.

53
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,590
Don't cry.

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Alright, alright.

55
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,650
Let's eat first.

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,620
We'll talk after eating.

57
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,380
I want to take charge
of Hu Kejia's charity sale project.

58
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,730
Where does your confidence come from?

59
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,780
You can't just take on

60
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,860
or drop a company project
whenever you want.

61
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,450
It was my fault before,

62
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,120
but now I'm ready.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,970
But the project
can't wait for you forever.

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,210
Work isn't meant to heal your wounds.

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,410
I was the one who broke up with him.

66
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,670
I'm not hurt.

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,910
The one who initiates the breakup

68
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,630
is often the one who is hurt the most.

69
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,140
Only when you've had
enough disappointment

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,210
can you have the determination
to say goodbye.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,260
I've already handed the project
to Han Ying.

72
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,410
Is there anything else I can do?

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,890
If you really want to do this project,

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,090
assist Han Ying.

75
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,470
Okay.

76
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,710
This way, please.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,060
Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,110
Thank you.

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Kejia.

80
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,590
Kejia.

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,570
She's usually like this.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,010
Her paintings are wonderful.

83
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
Please have a seat.

84
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,740
Actually, Kejia has a rich inner world.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,800
She just can't express it verbally.

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,140
Painting is her way
of expressing herself.

87
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,700
Thank you for organizing
this charity sale.

88
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,860
No matter how much we raise,

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
what matters most is raising awareness

90
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,770
about the inner world

91
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,090
of autistic children.

92
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,140
Can I spend some time alone with her?

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,130
Sure.

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,180
I'll get you some water.

95
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
Thank you.

96
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,710
Okay.

97
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,530
Have we found the exhibition venue

98
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,740
for the Hu Kejia Charity Art Exhibition?

99
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,480
We just got the last quote
from the final gallery.

100
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,500
We'll decide in the next few days.

101
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,110
Huang Yimei,

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,970
do you have anything to say?

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,060
I think

104
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,190
since the proceeds from this sale

105
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,890
will be donated to charity,

106
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,140
it's a pity

107
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,700
to spend on rent.

108
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,950
I think

109
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,820
we could use

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,260
our company's office space,

111
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,680
like the corridors and meeting rooms.

112
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,900
I also asked the property management,

113
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,920
and they're willing to let us use

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,410
the office building lobby

115
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,800
as a display space.

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,070
Using Cyan's office space

117
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,390
for the charity sale

118
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,670
would also be great publicity

119
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,090
for our company.

120
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,230
Yes.

121
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,060
That's one of our backup plans.

122
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,970
We can use this sale as a starting point

123
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,110
and continue to focus on art projects

124
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,820
for special children

125
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,530
in the long term.

126
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,890
That's a good idea.

127
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,910
If it doesn't compromise
the artistic value of the works

128
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,820
and our professionalism in curating,

129
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,210
I'll support it.

130
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,390
This project is a public welfare project,

131
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,560
not a commercial one.

132
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,940
It won't be part
of the performance review,

133
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,410
but I expect everyone

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,060
to put your heart into it.

135
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,090
That's all for today. Meeting adjourned.

136
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,510
How are you?

137
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,390
Pretty good.

138
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,930
I'm fine.

139
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,750
Don't worry.

140
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,460
There are many ways to vent.

141
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,460
If you feel like crying, go for a run.

142
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,350
I can accompany you.

143
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,050
Thank you, Su.

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,320
After all, I recruited you,

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,380
so I'm responsible for your work state.

146
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,390
Son,

147
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,100
your call.

148
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,150
I'll get it. Let me.

149
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,010
No problem. I'll get it.

150
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,750
Have you arrived?

151
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,630
I'll be right there.

152
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,580
Got a girlfriend?

153
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,890
No, just a workout buddy.

154
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,050
If you don't believe it,
come to the gym with me.

155
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,930
Alright, go ahead.

156
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,990
Bye.

157
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,930
Something's off about him.

158
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,340
Is she too upset

159
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,750
to work?

160
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,890
Not only hasn't it affected her work,

161
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,890
she's even more focused.

162
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,530
Maybe she's afraid of overthinking
if she has idle time.

163
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,890
Great. If everyone were like my sister,

164
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,040
you bosses would hope

165
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,140
all your employees break up.

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Morning, Ms. Jiang.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Ms. Jiang.

168
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
Come in.

169
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,220
Did you select all these paintings?

170
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
The less she talks about it,

171
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,340
the more I feel something's wrong.

172
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,810
She doesn't tell me anything anymore.

173
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,530
She talks a lot less.

174
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,750
She can distract herself
with work during the day,

175
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,950
but nights alone

176
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,340
are the hardest.

177
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,410
She doesn't seem fragile,

178
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,340
but her obedience is unsettling.

179
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,340
She doesn't argue or complain anymore.

180
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,910
My dad says

181
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,930
after she eats dinner every day,

182
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,140
she hides in her room to read.

183
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,050
She's so quiet like she's meditating.

184
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,080
Is she still learning French?

185
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,920
No,

186
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,690
she's reading

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,510
psychology books.

188
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,380
Very thick books.

and psychological issues.

that life should be about free creation.

Love is important,

but one cannot rely solely on it,

303
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,350

It helped me discover a new self

308
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,250
and set new life goals.

309
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,410

You even quit your job.

321

322

323
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,450
One must have the courage
to make decisions

324
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,690
and the courage to accept failure.

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,780
when he's upset, he tends to his plants.

375
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
Your brother

376
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,170
plays basketball and fishes.

377
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,650
When I'm unhappy, I cook.

378
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,890
As soon as I turn on the exhaust fan,

379
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,690
it feels like all my worries
are sucked away.

380
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,890
If you heal by studying,

381
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,730
I hope you fall in love
and break up many times.

382
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,450
Mom, don't jinx your daughter like that.

383
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,540
Everything has a reason,

384
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,780
but not everything has a right or wrong.

385
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,540
Whatever happened between you two,

386
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,970
if you don't want to tell me,
I won't ask.

387
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,580
I won't blindly take your side,

388
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,890
but I support you unconditionally.

389
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,170
Enjoy.

meet friends from all over,

425

learn rich knowledge,

426
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,210
and explore unknown fields.

427
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,550
So strong.

428
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,920
She must be an athlete.

You northerners are different.

- Get back to work.

We're just being honest.

438
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,670
Unlike some people,

439
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,350
who keep it to themselves
and don't say it out loud.

440
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,190
Right.

441
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,080
Senior,

442
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,170
there's a movie
in the auditorium tonight.

443
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,250
Join me?

444
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,300
I already have plans.

445
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,450
Why do you always have plans when I ask?

446
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,780
When will you be free?

447
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,870
It's the start of the school year.

448
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,310
There are many welcoming events.

449
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,150
Sorry.

450
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,800
Alright.

451
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,110
Let me know

452
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,020
when you're free.

453
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,110
Sure.

454
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,890
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

455
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,210
Why didn't you go?

456
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,590
I'm booked till Friday.

457
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,270
What's more important than a date?

458
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,440
Hu Lin is practically
throwing herself at you.

459
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,390
You're so unromantic.

460
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,030
She's not my type.

461
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,930
Get back to work.

462
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,730
What type do you like?

463
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,070
Computer Science?

464
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,490
Hey, are you from Computer Science?

465
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,020
What's your name?

466
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,020
(Huang Yimei)

467
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,170
Su, how are you?

468
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,400
It's been over a month
since school started.

469
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,930
I'm getting used
to the climate and life here.

470
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,380
Though I call home every week,

471
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,690
there are some things
I only want to tell you.

472
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,740
Writing to you feels like

473
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,800
(Would you like to read the new email now?)
sorting out my thoughts.

474
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,060
My secrets go to you.

475
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,300
First, the good news.

476
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,730
I found a job.

477
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,240
I'm working as a waitress
at a German beer house.

478
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,540
(Lecture on Chinese Modern Art History)

479
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,720
Psychology is the science
of studying people.

480
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,750
I want to interact more
with real people and society.

481
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,650
Learning by doing.

482
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,240
Studying taxes the mind,

483
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,210
and working taxes the body.

484
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,540
After classes and work,

485
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,820
my mind and body are exhausted.

486
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,210
I fall asleep as soon as I hit the bed.

487
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,830
Being back on campus

488
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,170
feels both familiar and strange.

489
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,340
The memories of books
and classes haven't faded,

490
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,820
but I am no longer the person I once was.

491
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,230
I don't have many classes
during the first year,

492
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,300
so I want to fill my time.

493
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Aside from work,

494
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,780
I attend lectures, watch movies,
and visit the library.

495
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,780
Being on campus keeps me busy.

496
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,890
With fewer people in my heart,

497
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,650
there's less friction,

498
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,730
and I feel much calmer.

499
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,500
(Kang)

500
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,870
Hello.

501
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,450
You can order now.

502
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,590
What would you like?

503
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,490
This one looks good.

504
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,490
Any drinks?

505
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,340
Anything else?

506
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
Alright, one moment.

507
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,390
Lin Hao,

508
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,750
I can't take that tutoring job

509
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,680
you recommended.

510
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,410
You should ask other classmates.

511
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,250
You're not tutoring anymore?

512
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,310
I found a part-time job

513
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,070
at a German beer house.

514
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,020
I don't have time now.

515
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,920
Come on.

516
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,620
Why suddenly work at a beer house?

517
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,660
How much can you earn waiting tables?

518
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,220
Why give up a white-collar job
for a blue-collar one?

519
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,040
What are you thinking?

520
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,170
Tutoring is too easy.

521
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,960
I want to try some physical labor.

522
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,970
Balancing work and rest.

523
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,800
Okay.

524
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,860
Oh, Hu Lin came looking for you.

525
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,630
You're such a blockhead.

526
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,250
What does she see in you, anyway?

527
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,680
Tuna sandwich

528
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,640
with pickles,

529
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,740
olives with green peppers,
and heated Thousand Island dressing.

530
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,540
I'm sorry.

531
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,860
Could you repeat that?

532
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,640
How can you work like this?

533
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,540
Was it that I didn't explain it well
or you didn't understand?

534
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,630
Tuna sandwich

535
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,830
with pickles,

536
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,680
olives with green peppers,

537
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,000
and heated Thousand Island dressing.

538
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,650
Can you get it now?

539
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,110
I'm getting confused here.

540
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,620
Why is ordering so difficult?

541
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,000
Hello, what would you like?

542
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,390
Tuna sandwich

543
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,300
with pickles,

544
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,240
olives with green peppers,

545
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,020
and heated Thousand Island dressing.

546
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,310
The lady said she wants

547
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,440
Tuna sandwich with pickles,

548
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
olives with green peppers,

549
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,410
and heated Thousand Island dressing.

550
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,590
Right, Ma'am?

551
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,560
Exactly.

552
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,240
Your service is bad,

553
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,970
not even offering some tea.

554
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,870
Sorry, sorry about that.

555
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,890
Sorry.

556
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,820
One moment, Ma'am.

557
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,040
Thank you.

558
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,320
You're welcome.

559
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,390
Are you from Shanghai?

560
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,970
No, I'm from Yanji in the northeast.

561
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,590
I've been in Shanghai for a few years.

562
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,450
If you want to learn Shanghainese,
I can teach you.

563
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
Thanks.

564
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,300
Why is she working?

565
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,880
Tell her in an email

566
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,790
to focus on her studies,

567
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,820
and not to worry about money.

568
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,540
I told her, but she doesn't listen.

569
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,210
I'll talk to you when we meet.

570
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,240
Zhenhua,

571
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,820
invite Su over for a meal someday.

572
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,140
- Why?
- We miss your sister.

573
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,390
If you miss her, call her.

574
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,720
What's it got to do with Su Gengsheng?

575
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,960
From what you said,

576
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,490
Rose tells her everything.

577
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,410
Invite her over, and let's talk.

578
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,200
She has her own life.

579
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,440
She's not my sister's nanny

580
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,820
or your informant.

581
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,540
No need to make such a fuss over a meal.

582
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,250
Are you guys running circles
around the South Pole or what?

583
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,440
I've told you. She's not my girlfriend.

584
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,730
What's going on?

585
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,060
If she's not your girlfriend,
she's still a friend.

586
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,820
Let us meet her.

587
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,860
She's been there just a few days
and got a job.

588
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,300
Oh, you coached her.

589
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,380
Finding a part-time job is easy for her.

590
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,750
Don't try to get info from me.

591
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,110
I'll tell you what needs to be said.

592
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,020
No coercion will work
for what shouldn't be said.

593
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,760
I knew it.

594
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,000
A meal won't buy you off.

595
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,450
My mom's overthinking.

596
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,780
What do you mean?

597
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,380
She wants me
to bring you home for dinner.

598
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,830
As my sister's friend,

599
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,690
not mine.

600
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,300
No, you're my friend,

601
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,820
but not that kind of friend.

602
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,730
You'll still meet my parents,

603
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,830
but not as a girlfriend.

604
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,210
Huang Zhenhua, do you like me?

605
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,190
Hello.

606
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,300
Did you enjoy the food?

607
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,780
You haven't eaten much.

608
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,490
Is it not good?

609
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,780
No, it's good.

610
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,580
It is good.

611
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,170
Do you like me?

612
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,580
Of course, I do.

613
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,750
You're talented and charming.

614
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,480
Even my sister likes you.

615
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,400
So, I do too.

616
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,420
Stop shaking.

617
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,540
Look at me.

618
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,900
Do you like me like you did your ex?

619
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,800
No.

620
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,020
What we have is a mentor-student bond.

621
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,070
Coach and her student.

622
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,910
A mentor-student bond.

623
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
Good.

624
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,140
How did you get that arm injury?

625
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,120
You noticed.

626
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,150
It means
you've been paying attention to me.

627
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,420
I did notice you.

628
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,110
You've been coming for a week

629
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,360
and always asking me to serve you.

630
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,640
Ordering a big table of food each time

631
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,850
but barely eating.

632
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,290
I'm not here for the food.

633
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,730
You've successfully caught my attention

634
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,770
and my disdain.

635
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,900
I hate people wasting food.

636
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,580
Sorry.

637
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,580
Can I buy you a coffee

638
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,020
to apologize?

639
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,770
At least tell me your name.

640
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,500
In the store, call me "waitress".

641
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,190
I hope you stop

642
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,250
wasting food here.

643
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,920
Men shouldn't waste time

644
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,140
more than wasting food.

645
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
Okay?

646
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,500
Do you swim?

647
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,280
We could swim together sometime.

648
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,120
Sure.

649
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,020
Fang, join us.

650
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,210
Me?

651
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,420
I can't swim.

652
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,840
You're big

653
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,070
but can't swim?

654
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,100
A landlubber.

655
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,030
We'll plan other activities then.

656
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,870
Okay.

657
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,940
I'm off.

658
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,230
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

659
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,330
Don't be late tomorrow.

660
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,510
Okay.

661
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,550
The bus is here. Bye-bye.

662
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,390
Sure.

663
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,300

What's up, Huang?

690
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,960
We won the architecture award

691
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,850
and need to go to Sydney
for the ceremony.

692
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
You go.

693
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,460
I need to go to Germany.

694
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,150
You're the department manager.

695
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,710
How would it look if I went?

696
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,880
I'll take care of
the Germany project for you.

697
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,770
Why?

698
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,510
The trip to Germany is just three days

699
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,540
about meeting two suppliers.

700
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,210
It's barely enough to adjust
to the time difference.

701
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,440
With a ceremony, tours,
good food, and fun,

702
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,940
a week in Sydney is a cushy gig.

703
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,770
Why do you suddenly want to swap?

704
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,240
Do you want to swap or not?

705
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,730
I'll bring you a gift from Sydney.

706
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,840
Hello?

707
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,170
I'm working.

708
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm going on a business trip
to Germany next month.

709
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,150
I got it in exchange
for the easy trip to Sydney.

710
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,140
Do you know why?

711
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,500
Although the schedule is tight,

712
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,330
I have one day

713
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,810
to visit Paris.

714
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,070
Rest assured.

715
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,690
I'm not persuading you two to reconcile.

716
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,330
Even though
you've been apart for so long,

717
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,810
I know

718
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,690
you're still hurting inside.

719
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,420
Do you remember
how you advised me back then?

720
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,550
I don't want you
to make unnecessary sacrifices,

721
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,170
or to seek solace in desperation.

722
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
We need to uproot

723
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,420
this problem completely

724
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,940
to start a new relationship.

725
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,100
It's long gone.

726
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,620
Not dating isn't because of him.

727
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,460
You still need
to give him an explanation.

728
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,690
Do you have any messages for him?

729
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,170
There's a string of teddy bear keys
in my drawer.

730
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,680
Give it to him for me.

731
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,320
And

732
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,370
don't give him my Shanghai number.

733
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,230
Huang, you came all this way,

734
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,710
and you brought stuff. So troublesome.

735
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,550
I didn't bring much.

736
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,840
Just some Beijing snacks.

737
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,020
Probably can't find them in Paris.

738
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,420
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

739
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,920
The house is a bit messy.

740
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm actually moving.

741
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,070
Moving?

742
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,230
Shall we put down our stuff

743
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,580
and go downstairs to a restaurant?

744
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,590
No need. My train leaves this afternoon.

745
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,620
Can't stay long.

746
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,400
What would you like to drink?

747
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,240
Water is fine.

748
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,540
This place is nice.

749
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,580
My colleague rented this house.

750
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,420
We used to live together.

751
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,370
- Thanks.
- Sit.

752
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,250
Then why move?

753
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,900
Is it inconvenient with a girlfriend?

754
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,020
I got a promotion this year.

755
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,240
Got a significant raise.

756
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,330
Wanted a change of environment.

757
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,650
The job is much easier now,

758
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,770
but I don't have the heart

759
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,320
for dating.

760
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,270
It's quite lively downstairs.

761
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:55,990
How is she?

762
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,250
