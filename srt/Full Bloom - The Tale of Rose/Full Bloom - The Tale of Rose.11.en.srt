00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
Do I have to report to you every detail

4
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,190
of what I do

5
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,990
and who I meet every day?

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,440
Even if it's not overtime,

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
do I not have the right to have a drink?

8
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,990
Do you want to control everything like my mom?

9
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,440
I'm not trying to control you.

10
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,180
There's a six-hour time difference between us.

11
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,780
We have to catch each other
at the right time to talk.

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,580
If you're not saying anything,

13
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,940
what else is there to talk about?

14
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,260
I really don't have the energy
to argue with you.

Rose.

44
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,620

motivates me to get up every day.

I'm sorry.

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,740
Coach, good evening.

60
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,300
So formal.

61
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,980
I think we should run near a hospital.

(Architectural Design Institute)
In case something happens to me,

63
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,780
we'd be close to the ICU.

64
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,100
Like this, right?

65
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,100
Yes.

66
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,140
Warm-up.

67
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
Huang.

68
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,460
Take a rain check?

69
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,620
No.

70
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,580
Well.

71
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,220
Sorry, I'll schedule another day with you.

72
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,940
Uncle Bai,

73
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,660
sorry I didn't accompany you to Guangxi.

74
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,700
I should have told you in person.

75
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,980
It's fine. I know.

76
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,180
It was Xiaohe who didn't let you go.

77
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,620
Don't cover for her.

78
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,300
Then you should know,

79
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,340
Xiaohe and I already broke up.

80
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,740
It's all Xiaohe's fault.

81
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
She hurt you,

82
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,540
I apologize on her behalf.

83
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,900
Please don't say that.

84
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,220
Xiaohe didn't lie to me. I'm grateful to her.

85
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
I wonder how she's doing recently.

86
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,020
Xiaohe told us

87
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
she broke up with you.

88
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,660
Her mom had a big fight with her.

89
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,500
Then she went back

90
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,220
to live at school

91
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,140
and hasn't come home since.

92
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,020
Not even answering our calls.

93
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,140
I shouldn't meddle in your relationship,

94
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,700
And now,

95
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,220
I have no right to ask you

96
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,660
for anything regarding Xiaohe.

97
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,020
But

98
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,740
we are really worried about her.

99
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,500
Huang,

100
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
you live at school,

101
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,060
Could you check on her for us?

102
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,660
She's our only daughter.

103
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,780
As long as she's safe and healthy,

104
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,980
we won't oppose

105
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,820
whatever she does in the future.

106
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,340
Okay, Uncle Bai, I'll check on her.

107
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,220
Thank you, Huang.

108
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,740
You're welcome.

109
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,260
If only my daughter

110
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,820
had met you first.

111
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,620
Have you heard of Hu Kejia?

112
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,420
She's a nine-year-old girl

113
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,860
with autism.

114
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,620
I've seen her work.

115
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,040
She's incredibly talented.

116
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,220
Her parents

117
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,180
are planning a charity sale of her works.

118
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,620
All proceeds

119
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,100
will be donated to autism charities.

120
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,780
Who is interested in this project?

121
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,780
Huang Yimei?

122
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,380
I don't really want it.

123
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,040
What are we eating tonight?

124
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,660
Huang Yimei, are you out of your mind?

125
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,230
Tina gave you this project
in front of everyone.

126
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,780
Do you not understand

127
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,620
what that means?

128
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,620
I know, but I have other plans.

129
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,460
Who can assign you work besides the boss?

130
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,860
I'm going to France

131
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,660
to see Eric.

132
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,300
To you, is a man more important

133
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,260
than work?

134
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,300
You just curated an exhibition.

135
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,260
Don't think

136
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,580
you've secured this job.

137
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,180
But he needs me now.

138
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,230
Do you think Tina will approve your leave

139
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,420
because of it?

140
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,340
Will she?

141
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,120
(Application for Leave: Visit my boyfriend)
I'll follow up on the contract this week.

142
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,420
The design for the brochure
has also been confirmed.

143
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,340
We can place the prepayment order this week.

144
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,500
I'll need you to confirm it.

145
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,460
Before my vacation,
I'll get all the work arranged.

146
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,980
So, I have no choice

147
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,660
but to approve your leave.

148
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,940
If there's no other way,

149
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,260
then

150
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,180
there's no other option.

151
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,420
(Resignation Letter)

152
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,620
Now you're threatening me?

153
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,980
I've already arranged my schedule.

154
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,300
Sacrificing work

155
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,540
for a few days of romance.

156
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,740
Is it worth it?

157
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,820
Yes, it's worth it.

158
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,100
You're so unambitious,

159
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,060
without career planning at all.

160
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,420
Is love your only goal?

161
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,260
For now, yes.

162
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,580
As long as I love him, he comes first.

163
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,060
And I don't think this is inferior to others.

164
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,100
(Application for Leave)

165
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,900
Thank you.

166
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,140
Based on your performance,

167
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,820
this takes effect at any time.

168
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,300
Mr. Martin, nice to meet you.

169
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,620
Ma'am, nice to meet you.

170
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,900
You may enter the palace.

171
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,660
Thank you. Do you smoke?

172
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,300
No, thank you.

173
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,420
How about a cup of tea?

174
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,820
I'd love to.

175
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,900
I love freedom.

176
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,940
We're going on a trip.

177
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Rose,

178
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,780
I wish you were by my side

179
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,540
when I open my eyes.

180
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,620
I want to hold you in my arms

181
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,820
and hug you tightly.

182
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,300
That's enough.

183
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,220
Eight laps for a starter.

184
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,220
How do you feel?

185
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,680
Have you vented your emotions?

186
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,220
How did you know?

187
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,660
The person who came last time

188
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,500
seemed like an elder,

189
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,060
but

190
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,860
from your attitude towards him,

191
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,740
it wasn't like family familiarity,

192
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,020
nor like courteousness to a boss.

193
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,020
Also

194
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,940
you both seemed sensitive

195
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,020
about having a woman around.

196
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,660
You didn't dare to tell him

197
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,940
I was your friend.

198
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,900
It's not that I didn't dare.

199
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,540
After that night, you disappeared for two days.

200
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,860
No messages from you.

201
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,500
I figured

202
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,980
either he gave you

203
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,340
a huge task,

204
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,900
or his appearance affected your emotions.

205
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,860
So this person

206
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,080
came because of your ex-girlfriend.

207
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,340
One look and you understood everything.

208
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,220
Seems palace dramas aren't entirely made up.

209
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,460
- Here's some water.
- Thanks.

210
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
Here.

211
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,420
What excuse should I use to reject him?

212
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,940
You can't reject him.

213
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
You would've rejected him at the time
if you wanted to do it.

214
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,100
The reason you're still torn

215
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,780
is because you haven't let her go.

216
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,620
You still want to see her.

217
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
I've let go.

218
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,620
When it comes to stubbornness,

219
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,260
women are nothing

220
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,420
compared to men.

221
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,900
Don't struggle anymore.

222
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,380
Go and see her.

223
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,220
When I first met you,

224
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,820
I thought you were very cold.

225
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,660
I didn't expect

226
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,300
you to be both perceptive and sensitive.

227
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm a realist.

228
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,100
If the time and effort

229
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,420
spent on something

230
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,660
exceed its value,

231
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,100
either do it immediately,

232
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,180
or don't do it at all.

233
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,660
I can't stand

234
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,140
seeing a grown man

235
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,700
hesitating

236
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,180
over something so minor.

237
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,580
That's the Coach I know.

238
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,620
Feels good to be scolded.

239
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,980
Feels great.

240
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,820
I need to make up for the past two days.

241
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,660
I'll run two more laps.

242
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,740
I'll run two more laps.

243
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,340
Look, I've gained a lot.

244
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,780
I found a coach and a confidant.

245
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,500
Run more laps.

246
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,540
Come on.

It was my oversight. I'll fix it right away.

265
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,740
We're about to sign the contract,

266
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,980
and I just realized the amount is wrong.

267
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,700
I heard you're working overtime every day.

268
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,540
What have you been doing?

269
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,120
Just making international calls at the office?

270
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,900
Eric is on my team.

271
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,300
This is my responsibility.

272
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,540
The contract will be signed on time.

273
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,860
I guarantee it.

274
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,020
Eric, you're in my team,

275
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,900
and this is my responsibility.

276
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,060
You won't be having a second way out.

277
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,860
I know you're working very hard,

278
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,860
but don't let that

279
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,820
get in the way of your job.

280
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,340
Alright?

281
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,500
Alright.

282
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,900
Thank you.

283
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,380
The contract terms within the validity period

284
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,740
are extremely important.

285
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,340
Once it expires,

286
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,420
it's a disaster.

287
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
- Okay.
- You know.

288
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,940
The financial risk is huge.

289
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,660
Why are you here?

290
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,220
Sorry.

291
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,580
This is Naomi, my team leader.

292
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,340
My girlfriend, Rose.

293
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,460
Hello.

294
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,020
- Hi.
- Very pleased to meet you.

295
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,020
Nice to meet you.

296
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,180
- I'm setting you free and see you tomorrow.
- Okay

297
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

298
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,020
Oh, wait.

299
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,220
I'll send you the new contract tonight.

300
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,060
My girlfriend suddenly arrived.

301
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,340
It's a bit complicated.

302
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
Don't worry.

303
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,300
If there are any issues,

304
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,140
call me, okay?

305
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,220
See you tomorrow.

306
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,620
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

307
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
Bye.

308
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,320
How did you get here?

309
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,420
With a tour group.

310
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,990
A seven-day tour of France.

311
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,760
I can only stay in Paris for two days,

312
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,920

Aren't you going to sleep?

326
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,660
This contract must be finished today,

327
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,420
so I have time for you tomorrow.

328
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,340
Where's your roommate?

329
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,700
Still not back this late?

330
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,540
On a business trip.

331
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,900
Why did Naomi come home with you?

332
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,420
To help me revise this contract.

333
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,260
I never thought you'd come and see me.

334
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,140
Because you said

335
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,220
you wished to wake up with me by your side,

336
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,380
so you could hold me.

337
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,180
When will you finish?

338
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,940
Almost done.

339
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,220
Management training requires rotation
through various departments.

340
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,380
Now I'm in the operations department.

341
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,620
I'm not very familiar with it,

342
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,180
so it takes more time.

343
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
Luckily, the rotation ends next year,

344
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,790
and I might be assigned
to the marketing department.

345
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,500
Once settled, I can apply
for permanent residency.

346
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,140
You're applying for permanent residency?

347
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,420
Not returning to China?

348
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,220
I'll get the permanent residency

349
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,460
and decide later whether to return.

350
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,260
What about me?

351
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,620
If I become marketing manager,

352
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,020
my salary will double,

353
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,260
and we could rent an apartment together.

354
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,060
It'd be more convenient for you to stay.

355
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,140
You want me to move to France?

356
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,180
Yes.

357
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,020
You study art.

358
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,380
This is the art capital.

359
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,580
Perfect for you.

360
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,900
What about my parents?

361
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,140
And my job?

362
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,940
Your brother is in Beijing.

363
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,100
What are you worried about?

364
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,500
Your job is just an assistant,

365
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
with no great future.

366
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,220
I'm a curator.

367
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,580
Alright, a curator.

368
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,300
Cyan isn't a big company.

369
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
It claims to be a joint venture,

370
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,100
but it's just registered in Hong Kong, China,

371
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,340
with not much scale or reputation
in the industry.

372
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,700
Why do you get to decide for me?

373
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,980
It's the right decision.

374
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,900
But it's not my decision.

375
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,380
So many people are desperate to go abroad

376
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,780
because there are more opportunities there.

377
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,380
But my life is in China.

378
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,860
If you place me in France,

379
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,700
what will I do?

380
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,700
Will my life revolve around you?

381
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,540
Is that it?

382
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,060
I never said that.

383
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,860
Your attitude implies

384
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,220
I should come to France

385
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,060
to follow you,

386
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,140
because my job isn't good enough,

387
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,980
isn't important,

388
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,100
not as valuable as yours.

389
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,260
I never devalued your work.

390
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,940
People aim higher. It's a fact.

391
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,180
I'm applying for permanent residency

392
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,580
for our future.

393
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,900
That's your future.

394
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,340
You never considered me.

395
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,100
You didn't even discuss it with me.

396
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,340
Your words are so disheartening.

397
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,140
I did all this for us.

398
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,940
I just think you shouldn't decide alone.

399
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,660
You're overthinking.

400
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,380
I was just planning.

401
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,980
The training isn't over.

402
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,900
Nothing is certain yet.

403
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,300
Don't be angry.

404
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,980
I must finish my work today.

405
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,720
I have to finish it before it's too late.

406
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,900
Go to sleep.

407
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,420
Not angry, right?

408
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,740
Not angry.

409
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,700
What does "compliquer" mean?

410
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,540
Troublesome?

411
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,380
Go to sleep.

412
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,820
(School of Chemistry)

413
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,380
Thank you for visiting me

414
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,420
and bringing so much good food.

415
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,180
Your parents are very worried about you.

416
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,740
How have you been?

417
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,180
I can't live in the past forever.

418
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,140
So,

419
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,940
I made one last effort.

420
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,380
I went to his hometown

421
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,420
to see him one last time.

422
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,100

424
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,540
The subscriber you dialed
can not be connected for the moment.

425
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,300
Please try again later.

426
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,100
Xiaohe.

427
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,940
Can't we say goodbye in person?

428
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,780
See?

429
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,540
This is where I grew up.

430
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,140
You're a city girl.

431
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,380
You don't understand my pressure
and inferiority.

432
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,100
My family introduced me to a local girl.

433
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,100
We've been seeing each other for months.

434
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,220
Unless something unexpected happens,

435
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,300
I'll marry her.

436
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,980
Forget about me.

437
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,560
We shall never see each other again.

438
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,260
Being with you for those years

439
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,220
exhausted my lifetime's happiness.

440
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,860
I don't deserve that kind of life.

441
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,820
Sorry, Xiaohe.

442
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,860
From the start,

443
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,460
I shouldn't have met you.

444
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,860
After I came back, I vomited all day.

445
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,100
I completely figured it out.

446
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Now,

447
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,580
I just want to focus on my studies.

448
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,820
After getting my PhD,

449
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,340
I want to find a research institute abroad,

450
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,620
quietly doing experiments

451
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,980
and research.

452
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,300
Nothing else matters.

453
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,780
Having a plan is good.

454
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,780
I hope it works out.

455
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,100
I didn't tell my parents

456
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,700
about going to his hometown.

457
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,620
Understood. I won't tell them.

458
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,100
Thank you.

459
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,380
Advice without concrete solutions

460
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
is just empty talk.

461
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,420
My suggestion is

462
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,540
don't stay cooped up.

463
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,420
Go out more.

464
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,460
Watch comedy shows, movies,

465
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
or find a hobby.

466
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,300
Like me.

467
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,060
Since I started exercising,

468
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,700
I feel much better.

469
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,540
You really look different from before.

470
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,100
I even got a personal coach.

471
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,580
How about joining us for workouts?

472
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,260
Rose?

473
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,220
Rose,

474
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,660
Rose.

475
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Wake up. Get up.

476
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,580
Our plans have changed.

477
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,780
I took a day off,

478
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,820
but the big boss is coming
for a meeting this afternoon.

479
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,260
So we have to hurry.

480
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,100
Come on, get up.

481
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,460
We'll visit the Louvre in the morning,

482
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,860
see the Eiffel Tower at 1 pm,

483
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,540
and I must be back at work by 3 pm.

484
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,300
Get up.

In our freshman year,

496
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,260
the whole class saw this portrait.

497
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,460
Now we see the real thing.

498
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,860
Isn't it amazing?

499
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,660

This one.

519
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,660
Moules Marinières?

520
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,100
That takes too long.

521
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,460
We don't have enough time.

522
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,580
Let's have something simpler, okay?

523
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,740
Sandwiches?

524
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,300
Waitress.

525
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,580
Two sandwiches, please.

526
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,740
Alright.

527
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,180
Thank you.

528
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,940
Wait a moment.

529
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,220
Can you take a photo for us?

530
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,060
Sure.

531
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,900
Thank you.

532
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,220
Thank you.

533
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Alright, alright.

534
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,580
Okay.

535
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,940
You wait here for me.

536
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,380
Have a seat.

537
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,500
Naomi,

538
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,300
please come here.

539
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,060
Everyone, gather around.

540
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,940
Today is a very special day.

541
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,060
I want to share my joy with you.

542
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,460
First,

543
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,500
this month we finally completed

544
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,340
the "City and Artists" project.

545
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,620
We've been working on it

546
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,860
for the past six months.

547
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,300
This project received

548
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,940
very positive feedback.

549
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,940
(Before this moment,)

550
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,940
(I never realized)

551
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,340
(we were heading in opposite directions.)

552
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,780
(What I thought was closeness)

553
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,980
(was actually just passing by.)

554
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,580
Let's go. I'll make you a big meal.

555
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,900
Alright.

556
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Sir.

557
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,700
With pleasure.

558
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,820
With great pleasure.

559
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,300
Is this what you want?

560
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,420
Okay, okay.

561
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,740
Thank you.

562
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,220
Hello, sir, what would you like?

563
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,060
Alright, of course.

564
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,220
- Thank you.
- Hello.

565
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,300
Hello.

566
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,700
Please give me a baguette.

567
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,540
Alright.

568
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,220
Anything else?

569
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,970
A Camembert cheese, please.

570
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,820
Okay.

571
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,020
Would you like some caviar?

572
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,500
Sure.

573
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,020
- Thank you.
- Okay.

574
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,020
You're welcome.

575
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,340
No need for caviar. It's too expensive.

576
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,180
It's fine.

577
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,500
Tonight, I must make it up to you.

578
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,060
Here's your change.

579
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,180
Hello?

580
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
I can't. I have plans tonight.

581
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,220
Alright.

582
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,580
But I have to bring my girlfriend.

583
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,540
Okay.

584
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,580
Don't worry. These parties are very relaxed.

585
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,660
Does your mom often bring you
to her company events?

586
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,180
She knows many people
in the fashion and business circles.

587
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,820
Wealthy people are very interested

588
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,880
in art and cultural activities.

589
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,980
Eric,

590
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,300
I'm Chris,

591
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,940
Jessica's boyfriend.

592
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,740
By the way, she's arriving soon.

593
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,340
What would you like?

594
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,660
Champagne or red wine?

595
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,660
Would you like some champagne?

596
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,700
Yeah, champagne.

597
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Waiter.

598
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,980
Chris, this is my girlfriend, Rose.

599
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,500
Hello.

600
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,300
- Hello.
- Hi.

601
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,620
Cheers.

602
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,700
I'll go meet your mom.

603
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,500
Everything is great.

604
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,260
Chris is my mom's

605
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,820
boyfriend.

606
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,420
This is my mom.

607
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,300
Welcome.

608
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,420
Rose, my girlfriend, Huang Yimei.

609
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,620
I mentioned her to you before.

610
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,620
- Hello, hello.
- Hi, Ms. Song.

611
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,060
Lulu is here too.

612
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,780
Go and say hi to her later.

613
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,140
Okay.

614
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,700
Feel free.

00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,980
