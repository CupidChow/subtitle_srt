I'm here.

Here.

00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,550
Xiaohe.

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,180
Why did you bring stuff?

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,480
It's my first time to meet your parents,

28
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,460
so I brought some gifts.

29
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,990
Come in.

30
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,100
- Have some tea.
- Thank you, Mr. Bai.

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,380
The watermelon looks good. Have a piece.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,050
Sure, I'll have some later.

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Huang,

34
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,290
why did you bring wine?

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
It's my first visit,

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,570
so I brought a little token.

37
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,840
Do you drink often?

38
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,690
No,

39
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,290
just a bit of beer occasionally.

40
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,070
Mr. Bai,

41
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,000
is this a painting by Wu Guanzhong?

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,840
Yes, it is.

43
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,770
I just bought it this year.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,600
I saw this painting
at an exhibition last year.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,710
Didn't expect to see it
in your house this year.

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,580
It's amazing.

47
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,770
I heard you're into architecture design.

48
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,210
No wonder you appreciate art.

49
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,700
I'm flattered.

50
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,630
Compared to you,

51
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,050
Xiaohe is just a bookworm.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,970
She has a scholarly aura.

53
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,630
Huang,

54
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,480
come, I have many treasures.

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
Come, have a look.

56
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,770
How about this painting?

57
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,020
This is really good.

58
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,770
Come, there's even better here.

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
Uncle Bai,

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,460
I've truly seen everything today.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,090
I'm telling you,

62
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,560
I have many treasures.

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,460
- There's more?
- You've only seen a part of it.

64
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,070
By the way,

65
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,580
what do you think of this painting?

66
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,300
This one?

67
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,930
This painting...

68
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,020
It's either

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,620
by a master,

70
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,230
or

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,620
by a child.

72
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,650
I can't quite grasp it.

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,140
You're right.

74
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,930
This was painted by Xiaohe
when she was four.

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,650
This proud father

76
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,050
couldn't bear to throw away

77
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,860
his daughter's doodles,

78
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,530
and even framed them on the wall.

79
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,790
He's not afraid of people laughing.

80
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,320
- Lucky, I didn't praise it earlier.
- Let's eat.

81
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,530
Otherwise, I'd have been caught lying.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,370
You're lying to them anyway.

83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,700
Sit.

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,900
Come, Huang, sit down.

85
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,190
Thank you.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,160
Huang,

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,810
come visit often.

88
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,190
Please stop here.

89
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,620
Dad, Mom, you head back.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,930
I'll see him off.

91
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,670
Goodbye, goodbye.

92
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,460
Didn't expect your parents
to be so young.

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,210
And I didn't expect

94
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,630
that growing up
in such an artistic family,

95
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,500
you chose chemistry and even got a PhD.

96
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,460
Genetics are interesting.

97
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
You look so much like your dad,

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,930
but your personalities
are completely different.

99
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,380
Next time I visit,

100
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,090
I'll definitely ask for tips

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,020
on how to raise a scholar.

102
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,850
Actually, you won't need to come here.

103
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,900
I mean,

104
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,970
you've already
played along with me today.

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,500
It's enough trouble.

106
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,380
It's no trouble.

107
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,850
I have nothing to do anyway.

108
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,440
If my parents look for you later,

109
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,850
just say you're busy
or on a business trip.

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
Got it.

111
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,940
We agreed it's just an act, right?

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,520
I worry

113
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,560
you'll take it seriously.

114
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,580
That won't happen.

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,290
I provide professional acting services,

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
a flexible schedule,

117
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,880
excellent service, and affordable prices,

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,140
cheaper than extras
outside the Beijing Film Studio.

119
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,940
Alright, that's fine then.

120
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,870
What's this?

121
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,530
Even extras
need to spend money on props.

122
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,670
Take it.

123
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,580
Is it a real person?

124
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,790
No.

125
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,910
No?

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,590
An adult?

127
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,430
No.

128
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,850
Japanese?

129
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,230
Yes.

130
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,260
Crayon Shin-chan.

131
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,020
How did you know?

132
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,210
That was quick.

133
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,210
My turn, my turn.

134
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
Alright.

135
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,670
It's me.

136
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
How did you know?

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,260
Your heart only has me.

138
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,610
So, guess what

139
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,700
I want to do next.

140
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
What are you doing?

141
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,380
Aren't you at Bai Xiaohe's house?

142
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,380
I can't stay at their place.

143
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,340
This is my boyfriend,

144
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,870
Eric.

145
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,610
Hi, I'm Eric.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,830
What's your name
on the household register?

147
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Zhuang Guodong.

148
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,410
You brought my sister back?

149
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,700
What car do you drive?

150
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,400
I didn't drive.

151
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
We took a taxi.

152
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,170
You took a taxi back?

153
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,580
I'll be going now.

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,730
Okay, go ahead.

155
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,970
Mr. Huang, I'm leaving.

156
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Wait a moment.

157
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,950
I'll give you a ride.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,170
- Just a short drive. Let's go.
- No need.

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
What are you doing?

160
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,700
Do you think I don't recognize him
with different clothes?

161
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,380
Isn't that the one in the blue shirt?

162
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,600
What's wrong?

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,440
Who said she was heartbroken last week?

164
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,610
You even smashed your phone.

165
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,060
So you only changed your phone,
not the person.

166
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,550
Mind your own business.

167
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,700
Using me and then discarding me, right?

168
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,960
When you needed me, I was your advisor.

169
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,850
- Now...
- Now I've got him.

170
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,090
I don't need you anymore.

171
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,710
No, no.

172
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,180
I need to know the place.

173
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,790
In case you go missing,

174
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,180
I'll know where to find you.

175
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,460
Get in the car. I'll drive you.

176
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,060
What are you doing?

177
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,190
Come on.

178
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,710
Are you both going to sit in the back?

179
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,970
Am I your driver?

180
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,340
Then I'll sit in the front with Mr. Huang.

181
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,440
You don't look much younger than me.

182
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,850
How come you don't have a car?

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
How about a driver's license?

184
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,990
You don't have one either?

185
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,830
I have a license.

186
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,870
I just returned from abroad last year,

187
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,300
so I haven't thought about buying a car.

188
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,820
Oh, a returnee.

189
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,820
No wonder the perfume is all over you.

190
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
After this ride with you,

191
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,540
I won't need air fresheners
in my car for half a month.

192
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
Huang Zhenhua.

193
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,660
He's joking with me.

194
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,540
If you like it,

195
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,790
I'll give you a bottle.

196
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,950
I don't use it.

197
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,660
I use Six God.

198
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,300
Never heard of Six God, huh?

199
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,310
Yes, I have.

200
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,820
(1 new message)

201
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,420
(From Huang Yimei:
My brother likes basketball)

202
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
(and works in architecture.
You handle it.)

203
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,950
Zhenhua,

204
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,180
I need to use the bathroom.

205
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,890
Why are you so troublesome?

206
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,670
Hold it in.

207
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,210
- You insisted on coming.
- Are you okay?

208
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,930
There's a gas station over there.

209
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,300
(Restroom)

210
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,090
I'll buy some drinks.

211
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,900
(Restroom)

212
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,240
Thanks.

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,760
No problem.

214
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,040
What did you take her to eat?

215
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,460
What's taking her so long?

216
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,950
Why is there nothing wrong with you?

217
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,180
Nothing special.

218
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,340
Maybe she caught a chill.

219
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,940
Not bad.

220
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,920
I don't believe it.

221
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,210
I was the star player on the school team.

222
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,350
This can's grip is off.

223
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,940
You must've gotten lucky earlier.

224
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,700
I also played on the school team.

225
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,070
What position?

226
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,950
Guard.

227
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,640
And you?

228
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,480
Forward.

229
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,730
With your height, a forward?

230
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,890
What's wrong with my height?

231
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,160
Muggsy Bogues is 1.6 meters tall.

232
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
Earl Boykins is 1.65.

233
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,420
They both played in the NBA.

234
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,660
Spud Webb is 1.69 meters tall

235
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,510
and won the 1986

236
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,340
NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

237
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,490
I'm 1.8 meters tall.

238
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,540
Why can't I play forward?

239
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
Besides,

240
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,550
you're not

241
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,130
much taller than me.

242
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,490
That's it.

243
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,340
Touched the top of the flag, huh?

244
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,250
Don't trip.

245
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm wearing dress shoes.

246
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,540
They don't have any bounce.

247
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,340
The shoes are the problem.

248
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,550
Impressive.

249
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,420
Do you still play?

250
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,750
Yes, once or twice a month,

251
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,850
with high school friends.

252
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,600
It's hard to get people together now.

253
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,350
If you want to play,

254
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,460
help us fill out the team next time.

255
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,320
Sure, give me your number.

256
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,470
Call me next time you play.

257
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,090
Okay, my phone's in the car.

258
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,480
Call me.

259
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,870
- 139.
- 139.

260
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,710
6676.

261
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,040
312.

262
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,500
Got it.

263
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,400
Save it.

264
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,540
I'll call him now to set up a game.

265
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,990
Not today, I didn't bring my shoes.

266
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,830
I happen to have a friend

267
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,850
who owns a sneaker store,

268
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,210
with lots of retro styles.

269
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,800
- Plenty of options?
- Tons.

270
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,710
And all sizes?

271
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,550
All sizes.

272
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,460
Send me the address, and I'll visit later.

273
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Next time, I'll go with you.

274
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,780
I can get a discount.

275
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,520
A discount too?

276
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,440
Of course.

277
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,400
Let's not wait.

278
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,680
Let's go today.

279
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,520
Now?

280
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,210
- I'll call him first.
- Let's go, let's go.

281
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,670
You know

282
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,210
a lot of people.

283
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,890
It's hard to buy those shoes now.

284
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,880
Wait for me!

285
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,610
Rosie! Rosie!

286
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,360
Are you crazy?

287
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
What were you thinking?

288
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,150
- You forgot about me?
- Sorry, sorry.

289
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,990
Unbelievable.

290
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,750
What kind of brother are you?

291
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,490
- What were you doing?
- I was careless, sorry.

292
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,940
I was wrong.

293
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,490
And you.

294
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,830
- The conversation was...
- What were you thinking?

295
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,670
It was too engaging.

296
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,110
About what? Tell me, tell me.

297
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,270
Where were we?

298
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,110
Where to?

299
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,090
Rosie told me you're an architect.

300
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,890
I think architects are amazing.

301
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,510
I once visited

302
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,630
the Loretto Chapel in New Mexico.

303
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,700
Its spiral staircase

304
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,060
just spirals up.

305
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,240
At that time, building such a staircase

306
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
is incredible.

307
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,440
They say no one knows

308
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,600
how it was built even now.

309
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,690
You've been there?

310
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,270
Its spatial stress is quite complex,

311
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,270
like a spring.

312
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,240
There's always a state

313
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,890
where tension and pressure are balanced.

314
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,120
It was challenging to build then,

315
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,440
but not that difficult.

316
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,790
It just started with a support,

317
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,440
which was removed after it was built.

318
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,610
It's not as mysterious as they say.

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,990
Huang, you explained it
from a professional angle.

320
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,220
I learned something new.

321
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,400
But speaking of architectural marvels,

322
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,790
China's structures are more impressive.

323
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,510
So many grand palaces,

324
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,920
using mortise and tenon joints,

325
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,070
were built like stacking blocks,

326
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,370
layer by layer.

327
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,980
I'll get you some books.

328
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,840
You often hold exhibitions, right?

329
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,340
You can promote Chinese
architectural achievements more.

330
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,790
Sure.

331
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,160
We recently had a project idea

332
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,980
about building cities with pixel blocks.

333
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,680
Huang, if you have time,

334
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,790
come and guide us.

335
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,830
No problem. It's like playing with LEGO.

336
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,510
No big deal, I'm not bragging.

337
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,090
I could do it with my toes.

338
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,990
Great, it's settled then.

339
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,340
Settled, settled. I promise.

340
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,680
It's here, right?

341
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,040
Thanks.

342
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,860
Next time we fish, I'll call you.

343
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,320
Next time we play basketball,
I'll call you.

344
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,000
Settled.

345
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,340
Are you guys planning a date?

346
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,580
Not bad.

347
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,920
Wasn't the gas station scene a bit much?

348
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,130
I designed it that way.

349
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,980
What am I here for?

350
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,110
Hello?

351
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,760
Uncle Bai?

352
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,350
I'm at work.

353
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,170
Uncle Bai, this way.

354
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,470
Why not use the meeting room?

355
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,580
It's more spacious.

356
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,300
I'm not here for a meeting.

357
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,270
Using your meeting room isn't suitable.

358
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,300
Let's go to your office.

359
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,440
Sure.

360
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,280
The one inside.

361
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,150
Yuan Zheng,

362
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,450
make two cups of tea for me.

363
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,070
Who is it?

364
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,820
Bai Xiaohe's dad.

365
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,300
Uncle Bai, please sit.

366
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,280
Business secrets.

367
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,450
Please take a seat.

368
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,170
- Careful, it's hot.
- Thank you.

369
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,090
Boss, your tea.

370
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,170
Boss, do you need me
to order lunch for you?

371
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,610
By the way, Uncle Bai,

372
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
I have a meeting this afternoon,

373
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,510
so I can't take you out for lunch.

374
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,550
You'll have to settle
for a boxed lunch with me.

375
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,750
Great.

376
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,690
I've been wanting to try your work lunch.

377
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,640
Okay, Boss.

378
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,650
I'll order two servings.

379
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,550
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

380
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,390
Boss.

381
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,390
Please have some tea.

382
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,240
Uncle Bai,

383
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,680
don't listen to him calling me that.

384
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,890
I'm not any kind of boss.

385
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,850
I'm just a small department manager.

386
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,110
Have some tea.

387
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,110
How is it?

388
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,350
Tastes good.

389
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,240
It's an eight-yuan meal.

390
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,790
Last month it was
two meats and one vegetable.

391
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,600
This month
it's one meat and two vegetables.

392
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,980
Meat prices must have gone up.

393
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,930
You seem to know a lot.

394
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,300
I don't know
how much I carry in my wallet.

395
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
But when budgeting and quoting,

396
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,550
I scrutinize every expense,
even for office supplies and meals,

397
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,640
like a miser.

398
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,930
As a manager, you have to do that.

399
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,840
You have to spend some time and effort

400
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,160
on things unrelated to the profession.

401
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,020
The higher you go,

402
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,890
the more you focus on people and money.

403
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,790
You still have time

404
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,090
for design now,

405
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,750
so it means your position
isn't high enough.

406
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,930
There's room for promotion.

407
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,170
I just love architectural design.

408
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,540
I love creative work.

409
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,270
Leading a team of fewer than ten people,

410
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,950
designing, visiting sites,
getting scolded by clients,

411
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,060
and revising drafts repeatedly.

412
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,360
But when a project is finished,

413
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,020
I feel a great sense of accomplishment.

414
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,470
If I had a higher position,

415
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,310
it would mean

416
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,890
more meetings and socializing,

417
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,410
less actual work.

418
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,650
I'd rather

419
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,340
stay in this role until retirement.

420
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,130
Does that sound

421
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,440
unambitious?

422
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,260
Everyone has their own path.

423
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
You're not wrong.

424
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,020
Who says the goal in the workplace

425
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,890
is always to climb up?

426
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,590
If you can do the work you love

427
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,850
and are good at,

428
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,220
that's true happiness.

429
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,740
Do you, a successful entrepreneur,

430
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,020
really agree

431
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,410
with this small-contentment mindset?

432
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,540
I succeeded

433
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,830
because I did

434
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,060
what I love and am good at.

435
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,110
Uncle Bai,

436
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,720
you've taught me a profound lesson,

437
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,510
and I only treated you to a boxed lunch.

438
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,790
Sorry about that.

439
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,020
It was a spontaneous visit.

440
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,400
I had some business nearby

441
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,450
and remembered you worked here.

442
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,830
How's it going?

443
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,980
How's work lately?

444
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,750
Not bad. I have two projects

445
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,610
that will keep me busy
for over two months.

446
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,390
Here's the thing.

447
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,130
My wife and I
are planning a trip to Guangxi,

448
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,370
but Xiaohe won't take leave.

449
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,550
So, I'd like to invite you to come along.

450
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,740
If you go,

451
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,850
she can't refuse.

452
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,090
Me? Go with you?

453
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,450
We're leaving next week.

454
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,950
If you can arrange your work,

455
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,680
I hope we can use this chance

456
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,850
to get to know each other.

457
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,580
Of course,

458
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,120
you don't need to accompany us
the whole time.

459
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,060
Just a few days.

460
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,270
And if you lose income

461
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,650
because of the leave,

462
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,590
we can cover that part.

463
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,550
No, no, no. I have annual leave.

464
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,580
I have annual leave.

465
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,550
Do you agree?

466
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,040
I'm going.

467
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,610
Let's eat.

468
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,440
This is good.

469
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,340
Eat more if you like it.

470
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,870
Uncle Bai,

471
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,370
well...

472
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,000
What?

473
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,610
Nothing, I'll request leave later.

474
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,410
Right on time. Great.

475
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
Let's go.

476
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
Where to?

477
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,260
Who's that? Quite handsome.

478
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,850
- Alright.
- If it's your treat, I'll go.

479
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,990
Don't be late tomorrow.

480
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,890
I'll go my own way then.

481
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,830
Eric,

482
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,930
why are you here?

483
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,880
To pick up my girlfriend from work.

484
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,440
Bye.

485
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,980
Open the door.

486
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,630
Open the door.

487
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,410
I don't have the key.

488
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,980
Who says so?

489
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,190
From now on, you open the door yourself.

490
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,060
Starting now,

491
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,130
you are the lady of this room.

492
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,880
Aren't you afraid
I'll snoop through your stuff

493
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,090
when you're not around?

494
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,520
I have no secrets

495
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,300
from you.

496
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,300
Look, his face is kind of long

497
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,830
and round.

498
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,670
Yes.

499
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,790
Mom,

500
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,500
why do you still keep this?

501
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,090
It's creepy at home.

502
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,780
Look for what you need.
Don't throw my stuff around.

503
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,300
What was I looking for?

504
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,630
A hiking bag.

505
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,130
A hiking bag.

506
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,160
You're going on a family trip,

507
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,540
but we haven't even
met Bai Xiaohe in person.

508
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,270
Listen to you.

509
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,080
I'm going on a trip,

510
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,170
not moving in.

511
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,310
When we get back,

512
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,370
I'll have Bai Xiaohe properly visit you.

513
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,060
We also want to see

514
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
what the rich lady
who likes you looks like.

515
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,090
Didn't you introduce her to me?

516
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,470
I had no idea they were so wealthy.

517
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,820
Professor Liang didn't mention it.

518
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,740
Once you enter a rich family,
it's like a deep sea.

519
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,510
Can't you be like normal parents

520
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,790
and have blind confidence in your son?

521
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,450
Right, right. Everyone has their fate.

522
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,090
Survival of the fittest.

523
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,080
If you put it that way,

524
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,780
I'll definitely marry her.

Feel free to call me anytime
if you have any questions.

540
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,890
Alright, here.

541
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,370
When are you leaving?

542
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,060
Does it matter to you?

543
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,750
Just make sure you keep
your father-in-law company.

544
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,470
They just need one more person
for their trip.

545
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,450
Don't let me down.

546
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,130
Don't worry.

547
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,790
Xiaohe?

548
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,930
I just found out
that my dad came to see you.

550
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,310
It's okay.

551
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,160
Your dad asked

552
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,170
if I could join you all
for a trip to Guangxi.

553
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
You don't have to go.

554
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,960
Just tell him you have to work
or travel for business.

555
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,990
Find any excuse to get out of it.

556
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,930
No need.

557
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,790
I actually want to relax too.

558
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,920
I've never been to Guangxi.

559
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,890
I'm looking forward to it.

560
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,220
Does your family
go on a trip together every year?

561
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,410
That's a nice tradition.

562
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,110
Hello?

563
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,650
I'll let you get back to work.

564
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,450
I can see so far through it.

565
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,310
Xiaohe,

566
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,740
why are you here?

567
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,410
- I...
- You came just in time.

568
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,160
Look, I'm packing up.

569
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,550
Check if there's anything missing.

570
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,880
I prepared walkie-talkies

571
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,790
so that if anyone gets lost,

572
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,060
we can stay in touch.

573
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,820
And I brought some folding stools.

574
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,270
If you or your parents get tired,

575
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,270
you can rest

576
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,340
anytime and anywhere.

577
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,880
I also have

578
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,640
a first-aid kit and binoculars.

579
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
And this

580
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,310
inflatable neck pillow,

581
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,230
in case anyone has neck pain.

582
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,370
Come and have a seat.

583
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,680
Are you thirsty?

584
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,580
I'll make you some tea.

585
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,630
No need.

586
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,920
I'll leave after I tell you something.

587
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,170
Have you eaten?

588
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,270
What do you want to eat?

589
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,960
There's a restaurant downstairs.

590
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,800
We can order delivery.

591
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm not hungry.

592
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,950
I came to tell you...

593
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,500
What do you want to eat?

594
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,300
No need to rush.

595
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,300
Don't go on this trip.

596
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,130
Do you still have feelings for me?

597
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,300
I thought it would be simple.

598
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,130
I thought if we cleared things up,

599
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,740
we could be friends

600
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,170
and put on a show for our parents.

601
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,980
But I can tell
you still have feelings for me.

602
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,890
If I pretend I don't know

603
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,950
and keep letting you act with me,

604
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,500
I'd be using you.

605
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,090
My parents really like you,

606
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,000
or my dad

607
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,450
wouldn't have visited you at work.

608
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,500
Parents tend to like someone like me.

609
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,650
So, it's not fair to them either.

610
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,580
If you come on this trip,

611
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,820
my dad will like you even more,

612
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,260
and he'll find out it's all for nothing.

613
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,500
Sorry, I didn't think this through.

614
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,680
Sorry.

615
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,120
Su.

616
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
Ms. Su.

617
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,410
- Good morning, Ms. Su.
- Good morning.

618
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,590
Bye.

619
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,800
Thank you.

620
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,390
Have you signed the rental contract

621
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,230
for Sky Gallery?

622
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,780
Yes, I sent it out yesterday.

623
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,010
Remember to keep personal matters

624
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,320
outside the company.

625
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,230
Ms. Jiang,

626
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,970
you wanted to see me?

627
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,450
I wanted to see your boyfriend.

628
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,930
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,140
I'll make sure he doesn't come
to the office again.

630
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Mr. Teng will come to Beijing
in a few days

631
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,370
for the Fengcai International auction.

632
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,430
It coincides with the opening ceremony
of our exhibition.

633
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,620
I want to invite him.

634
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,830
Can Eric talk to him

635
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,530
and arrange some time for us?

636
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,870
Ms. Jiang,
I'm no longer on the project team.

637
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,830
I have no work contact with Eric.

638
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,930
Do you need to discuss this at work?

639
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,780
Ask him during your dates.

640
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,480
I don't want to leverage our relationship

641
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,450
to make Eric do things outside his job.

642
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,790
He was just Mr. Teng's assistant

643
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,220
during his studies in France.

644
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,790
He has no influence

645
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,010
over a big collector like Mr. Teng.

646
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,790
And Fengcai is our competitor.

647
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,700
Doing this

648
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,570
might offend them.

649
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,740
But I can get you
Mr. Teng's contact info.

650
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,340
Who do you think you are?

651
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,200
He is both your boyfriend

652
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,300
and a resource.

653
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
How can a smart girl like you

654
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,890
be so foolish when it comes to love?

655
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,700
Let me tell you.

656
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,570
I've had many relationships,

657
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,240
and most men

658
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,260
ring more side effects

659
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,970
than side benefits.

660
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,570
While Eric is still useful,

661
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,190
hold onto him.

662
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,310
Work is work, and love is love.

663
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,970
I won't let my relationship
affect my job,

664
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,310
but please, Ms. Jiang,

665
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,200
don't ask me
to use my relationship for work.

666
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,870
If he can't do this for you,

667
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,910
is it really love?

668
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,120
If he doesn't love you enough,

669
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,230
what's the value of this relationship?

670
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,350
What value?

671
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,870
What return are you getting?

672
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,570
Why should I get a return?

673
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,400
Huang Yimei,

674
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,260
as someone with experience,

675
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,300
let me remind you.

676
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,270
Your looks, education, and taste

677
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,140
are excellent,

678
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,200
but these advantages

679
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,970
aren't just for romantic relationships.

680
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,270
Fate has favored you with advantages,

681
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,100
but if you don't use them wisely,

682
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,340
you might waste them.

683
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,340
I don't see it that way.

684
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,300
Those advantages

685
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,260
aren't for cheating at work.

686
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,450
Love and work

687
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,570
use different currencies.

688
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,410
Relationships aren't

689
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,340
about equal exchanges.

690
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,410
I just know the person I love
loves me back,

691
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,930
and that's the best return for me.

692
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,550
Still not off work?

693
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,260
Waiting for your boyfriend?

694
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,340
I won't let him pick me up again.

695
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,780
Because of what Tina said?

696
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,240
Did you tell Tina

697
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,710
that Eric and I are dating?

698
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,270
You two practically
announced it yourselves.

699
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,300
You don't need me to tell her.

700
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,110
Let me tell you.

701
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,790
No one else here would dare
talk to Tina like that.

702
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,240
Her request is unreasonable.

703
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,080
Do you know?

704
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,890
She almost asked me to seduce Eric.

705
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,000
The term "by any means necessary"

706
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,220
is not derogatory in Tina's vocabulary.

707
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,600
In her view, as long as it's not illegal,

708
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,010
ability trumps rules.

709
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,820
You seem to know Ms. Jiang very well.

710
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,370
Have you worked for her for a long time?

711
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,780
I was brought over by her

712
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,740
from the previous company.

713
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,240
I joined her right after graduation.

714
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,700
She's sort of my mentor in the workplace.

715
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
The first boss
one encounters in the workplace

716
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,620
often shapes one's professional style.

717
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
But your styles don't seem alike.

718
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,750
That's because you don't know

719
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,850
what we've sacrificed for work.

720
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,640
If I had to choose, I'd still choose love.

721
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,370
You can always find another job
if you lose one.

722
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,830
But if you lose love...

723
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,260
Do you think
we're acting in a romantic drama?

724
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,260
You're just too young.

725
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,530
Aren't you supposed to go on a trip?

726
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,300
Get in the car first.

727
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,680
When we get home,

728
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,930
don't spill the beans to Mom and Dad,

729
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,260
so they won't ask too many questions.

730
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,620
Is it hopeless now?

731
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,300
There's not even a glimmer of hope.

732
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,740
The seed of hope has been uprooted.

733
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,270
How do you think she did it?

734
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,340
Her ex already has a new girlfriend,

735
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,000
yet she's still devoted to him.

736
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,350
I'm not bad, right?

737
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,230
And my feelings

738
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,350
for her are genuine.

739
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,930
Why can't I move her?

740
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,640
Didn't they say that a girl

741
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,710
would accept a guy because she's moved?

742
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,640
I'm not asking her to love me right now.

743
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,750
But why doesn't she
even accept my kindness?

744
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,280
She got food poisoning

745
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,680
and just recovered from gastroenteritis.

746
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,890
Can she handle

747
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,780
your heavy and spicy hotpot?

748
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Your theory of gluttony

749
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,700
is a bit cliché,

750
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,450
but it does make sense.

751
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm fine.

752
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,070
I'm fine.

753
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,890
It isn't my first time in love. I'm fine.

754
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,050
It's your first heartbreak.

755
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,010
Who said that? I've been dumped before.

756
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,710
You always played it down before.

757
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,750
This time,

758
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,740
it's different.

759
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,270
Is it possible that the ones before

760
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,100
were just right, compatible,

761
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,010
and only with Bai Xiaohe,

762
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,670
there's attraction?

763
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,050
Put it under the sun?

764
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,320
Yes.

765
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,970
Tastes differently.

766
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,110
Exactly.

767
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,360
- Good at cooking.
- All your favorites.

768
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,320
Dig in.

769
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,890
I have something to announce.

770
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,320
What is it?

771
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,780
