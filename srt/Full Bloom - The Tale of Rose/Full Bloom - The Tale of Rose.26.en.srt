00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 26=

3
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,940
Daddy, I'm hungry.

4
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,300
Alright.

5
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,580
I will cook for you.

6
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,580
Don't touch these eggs, Taichu.

7
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,940
Didn't I tell you not to touch them?

8
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,300
Why don't you listen?

9
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,380
What?

10
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,420
What's wrong?

11
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,740
Taichu?

12
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,500
Did you get burned?

13
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,060
What's wrong?

14
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,580
- Mommy!
- Come here.

15
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
Where did you go?

16
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,340
I called you and you didn't answer,

17
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,380
and you didn't reply to my messages.

18
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,900
I had an interview this afternoon.

19
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,100
I forgot

20
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,860
to turn off silent mode.

21
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,780
Don't cry, don't cry.

22
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,100
I bought you some books.

23
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,380
Is that okay?

24
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,100
Come here.

25
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,580
Did you go shopping?

26
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,100
Alone?

27
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,060
Huang Yimei.

28
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
I've been thinking.

29
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,620
Maybe you shouldn't go to work.

30
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,700
Taichu,

31
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,140
help me unpack this bag, okay?

32
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,180
Go back to your room. Take it.

33
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,180
Don't let it fall.

34
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Good.

35
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,620
Every time I mention going to work,

36
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,300
you stop me in every possible way,

37
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,660
giving me a hundred reasons not to go.

38
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,380
What's your reason this time?

39
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,700
Why do you insist on working?

40
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,140
The company has done very well this year,

41
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,780
and we've paid off our loan early.

42
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,700
There's no financial pressure.

43
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,180
I work not just for money.

44
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,780
Then for what?

45
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,860
To leave this house?

46
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,900
I want something to do.

47
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,500
There are plenty of things to do at home.

48
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,380
You can take Taichu out to play.

49
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,220
Isn't that good?

50
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,940
Taichu will start kindergarten soon.

51
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,020
What will I do at home?

52
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
Then you

53
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,180
have another son.

54
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,540
How about that?

55
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,340
Look.

56
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
We have a daughter.

57
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,420
Having a son

58
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,420
would complete the picture.

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,620
I don't have the energy.

60
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,700
I haven't thought about it.

61
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,660
You have the energy to work,

62
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,500
but not to have a son?

63
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,300
Fang Xiewen, you just want a son.

64
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,260
Is that it?

65
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,980
Taichu,

66
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,260
how much have you unpacked?

67
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,500
Let me help you unpack, okay?

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,460
- She's so pretty.
- Exactly, exactly.

69
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,380
Let me zoom in for you.

70
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
Zoom in and take a look.

71
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,380
- How beautiful!
- My granddaughter.

72
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,470
- So pretty, so pretty.
- Really beautiful.

73
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,220
I like this one.

74
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,340
She's another Rose.

75
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,780
Zoom in for a closer look.

76
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,420
Nieces follow the uncle,

77
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,300
so she's bright and pretty.

78
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,580
You eat.

79
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,220
She's so pretty.

80
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,740
I deserve credit for that.

81
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,820
When you guys have kids in the future,

82
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,140
I suggest following Su.

83
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,900
With your looks,

84
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,420
don't burden the next generation.

85
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,780
Since you're so worried,

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,020
let's just not have any.

87
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,220
There won't be any risk then.

88
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,060
Stop saying nonsense.

89
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,900
Appearance doesn't matter,

90
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,460
but the child must be as smart as Zhenhua.

91
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Exactly.

92
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,180
Give me another one.

93
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,660
- This one.
- This one.

94
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,780
Really?

95
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,630
There's more.

96
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,380
- This one is good.
- Why haven't I seen it?

97
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,540
There's one.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,300
So pretty.

99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,220
Look. She's asleep.

100
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,260
Flip to the back. There's more.

101
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,740
There's more. There's more.

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,990
This one is good-looking.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,020
- Look further back.
- Why isn't it moving?

104
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,340
Help me check this out.

105
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,300
Press this to return.

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
Hey, Su.

107
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,300
Su.

108
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,420
Do you have something to do tomorrow morning?

109
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,780
Let's go home early tonight.

110
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,420
I'll accompany your parents a bit more.

111
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,860
Look.

112
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,260
Don't procrastinate about tomorrow's matters.

113
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,060
They're engrossed in looking at the photos.

114
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
Why do you keep asking me to go back?

115
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,020
You can just send the photos

116
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,300
to Mom and Dad.

117
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,220
Look at this one.

118
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,380
- You...
- Look, look.

119
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,700
Pouting.

120
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,500
Isn't she pretty?

121
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Didn't you say before

122
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,620
that you didn't want to get married
or have kids?

123
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,140
If I never wanted kids in my life,

124
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,620
would you still be with me?

125
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,620
Honestly, I like kids,

126
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
but I care about you more.

127
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,780
If I had to choose one,

128
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,900
I'd definitely choose you.

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,100
I haven't had a family for a long time.

130
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,380
It's just been me in our family.

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,460
Now that I have you,

132
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,900
I think maybe someday

133
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,500
there could be one more person in our home.

134
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
When do you plan to tell your parents

135
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,700
about what happened to me in the past?

136
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,780
I won't tell them.

137
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,820
If telling them would make it easier for you,

138
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,820
I can tell them anytime.

139
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,100
After all, it's your privacy.

140
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,620
If you don't want to say,

141
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,860
we'll never mention it.

142
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,220
Then they will never see my family members.

143
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,220
Isn't that strange?

144
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,380
So what?

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,780
We could just go to the Beijing Film Studio

146
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,980
and hire a hundred extras,

147
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,340
so you can have not just family,

148
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,220
but all the distant relatives too.

149
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,060
In a grand procession.

150
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,540
Taichu, let me tell you.

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,900
Never put metal in the microwave.

152
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,740
Got it?

153
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,660
Why?

154
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,060
Because it'll explode!

155
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,900
It will be like this.

156
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,020
Boom!

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,860
She doesn't cook anyway.

158
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,740
Why are you telling her this?

159
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,380
Basic life skills.

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,540
Mommy, the milk spilled.

161
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,620
It's okay.

162
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,820
I taught you how to clean it last time, right?

163
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,660
Do you remember?

164
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,640
You remember, right?

165
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,140
Let's go.

166
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,500
You let her clean it herself?

167
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,780
If she doesn't do it well, I'll do it later.

168
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,860
She's so young.

169
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,140
She needs to learn that from a young age.

170
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
Last night,

171
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,820
you didn't sleep in the bedroom?

172
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,700
I stayed in the study
because I was reading late.

173
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,340
Whatever.

174
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,660
(Grave of Late Father, Su Wangnan)

175
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,060
(Dad,)

176
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,940
(I'm getting married.)

177
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,180
(Grave of Late Father, Su Wangnan)

178
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,780
(He's someone I can trust.)

179
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,980
(I don't want to lose him.)

180
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,980
(But between husband and wife,)

181
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,620
(there should be honesty,)

182
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,420
(right?)

183
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
(There's something)

184
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,620
(I think I should tell him.)

185
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,180
Gengsheng.

186
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,580
Gengsheng.

187
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,940
Congratulations on your wedding.

188
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,780
I'm not good at picking gifts,

189
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
and I don't have much money,

190
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,500
so I can't afford anything too expensive.

191
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you.

192
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,540
I really like it.

193
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,340
Take me in.

194
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,420
Okay.

195
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,940
Where's Taichu?

196
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,780
She's asleep.

197
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,660
Are you going

198
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,700
to stay in the study tonight?

199
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,620
I haven't heard from the last interview.

200
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,820
I'm going to send out a few more resumes.

201
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
Come on.

202
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,620
How much do I have to earn to satisfy you?

203
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,540
Why do you have to work anyway?

204
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,180
Isn't the money I earn enough for you?

205
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,100
Taichu will be going to kindergarten soon.

206
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,500
What can I do at home alone?

207
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,380
What can you achieve by going out?

208
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,780
How much money can you earn
working for someone else?

209
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,180
You might as well stay home, enjoy the peace,

210
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,140
and do some housework.

211
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,180
Most importantly,

212
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
take care of your health.

213
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,980
Don't end up with problems

214
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,660
like when you were pregnant with Taichu.

215
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,300
End up with problems?

216
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,580
When?

217
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
In case.

218
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,220
In case we have another one,

219
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,450
what should you do?

220
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,900
It won't happen with conditions like this.

221
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,940
Isn't it just about money?

222
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,860
Why not stay at home and expect our son?

223
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,860
I can earn that money.

224
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,700
Do you really think everything

225
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,140
can be solved with money?

226
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,900
Fang Xiewen, why do you

227
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,700
insist on having another one?

228
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,300
Isn't Taichu good enough?

229
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,060
You also have two children in your family.

230
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,380
Isn't it lively?

231
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,420
Why do you resist it

232
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,500
every time I bring this up?

233
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,540
It's not that.

234
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,700
For Taichu's sake.

235
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,940
Huang Yimei,

236
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,180
can you stop being so selfish?

237
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,460
I am selfish?

238
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,780
I spent all my time these three years
on Taichu.

239
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,540
You're accusing me of being selfish?

240
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,940
The child is ours.

241
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,340
Why can you work, but I can't?

242
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,300
No.

243
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,380
Men work outside, and women manage the home.

244
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,580
Isn't that how it should be?

245
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,100
I support you.

246
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,380
I support the child.

247
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,220
When have I ever complained?

248
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,620
I work hard,

249
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,020
work overtime, and meet clients.

250
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,620
Every penny I earn

251
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,460
is spent on this family.

252
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,140
What are you dissatisfied with?

253
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,020
It's about money again.

254
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,180
Then let me ask you.

255
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,940
Why do you have to work?

256
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,260
Not for money?

257
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,020
To realize your own value?

258
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,060
What does that value depend on?

259
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,740
Isn't it still money?

260
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,860
Am I wrong in saying this?

261
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,620
I was married before.

262
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,220
He was a classmate from middle school.

263
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,740
His parents divorced

264
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,020
when we met.

265
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,940
Both his parents remarried,

266
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
and neither wanted him.

267
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,140
He was like me,

268
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,580
desperately trying to escape that place,

269
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,540
but all we could do was study.

270
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,060
(Try our best to get into college;
Leave no regrets in the end)

271
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,940
(Medical Help)

272
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,220
We can do this.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,440
We can do this.

274
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,220
(To Peng Songtao,
Beijing University of Finance and Economics)

275
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,900
Gengsheng!

276
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,180
Gengsheng!

277
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,860
I've made it, Gengsheng!

278
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,580
- Songtao!
- I've made it, Gengsheng!

279
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,700
I've made it.

280
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,470
Look.

281
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,340
- Where?
- I've made it.

282
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Great, both of us will be in Beijing.

283
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,580
I'm also in Beijing.

284
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,580
This is great.

285
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,900
We really got in.

286
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,660
We can finally leave here.

287
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,740
Gengsheng,

288
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,060
we can go to Beijing together.

289
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,780
We can go to university in Beijing together.

290
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,300
That's great.

291
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,300
That's great.

292
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,980
So,

293
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,780
we naturally ended up together.

294
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,700
Later on,

295
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,500
we went to Beijing together,

296
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,540
trying hard to establish ourselves
in this city.

297
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
Quick, quick, quick!

298
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,060
Beijing Station.

299
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,300
(Beijing Station)

300
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,140
This way.

301
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,180
It's Beijing.

302
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,940
- Beijing.
- Beijing.

303
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,460
- I'm here!
- I'm here!

304
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,820
After graduation,

305
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,020
he joined a state-owned enterprise.

306
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,900
Married employees can get housing allocations

307
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,500
and solve their spouse's
household registration.

308
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,580
Are you trying to tell me

309
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,380
that your marriage

310
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,540
wasn't about love,

311
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,380
just benefits?

312
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,340
He wanted a house.

313
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
You wanted household registration.

314
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,460
Yes.

315
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,300
After graduating from university, we realized

316
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,060
that we were just sympathizing with each other.

317
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
It was not love at all.

318
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
We were too alike,

319
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,020
feeling the world was against us.

320
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,420
Only by sticking together could we survive.

321
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,980
Later, he was sent abroad for work,

322
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,100
and we divorced.

323
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,300
Since then, we haven't seen each other again.

324
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,220
Anyway,

325
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,460
it was wrong of me to hide this from you.

326
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,180
I have nothing to defend.

327
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,220
Let's go.

328
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,340
I'll take you home first.

329
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,980
Sorry.

330
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,740
What's wrong, Mom?

331
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,420
Didn't you say to bring Su home for dinner
after getting the certificate?

332
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,860
Why haven't you come over yet?

333
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,220
We didn't get the marriage certificate today.

334
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,700
Why?

335
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,500
Something urgent

336
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,220
came up at our company,

337
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,140
and I had to deal with it all day.

338
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,260
I forgot to tell you.

339
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,020
What could be more important

340
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,300
than getting married?

341
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,980
It's quite important.

342
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,700
I'll take the household register
back this weekend.

343
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,340
Keep it.

344
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,740
You'll have to pick another day to get married.

345
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,460
Sure.

346
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,100
I'll hang up now.

347
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,660
They didn't get it.

348
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,140
Why?

349
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,940
They said it was because of work.

350
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,780
They can do it another day.

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,820
What happened?

378
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,020
You didn't get the certificate.

379
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,340
Was it because of the company

380
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,900
or you and Su?

381
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,140
Enough.

382
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,820
He has had too much to drink.

383
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,340
His stomach must be uncomfortable.

384
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,460
Hurry up and make him something to eat.

385
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,260
Stop pushing me.

386
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,140
With him like this,

387
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,100
I have to know why.

388
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,180
- Alright.
- Look at you.

389
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,100
(Household Register)

390
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,740
(Household Register)

391
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,900
We've talked with Yuanhang for so long.

392
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,300
Why did you suddenly decide
to sell to Tianlangxing?

393
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,500
Their offer

394
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,020
was five millions higher than Yuanhang's.

395
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,980
Fang,

396
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,300
selling to Tianlangxing

397
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,900
will weaken our control.

398
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,380
Tianlangxing's acquisition

399
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,660
is to squeeze out Yuanhang's market share.

400
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,940
Have you carefully reviewed

401
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,060
this acquisition offer?

402
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,780
I have.

403
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,060
And you agreed?

404
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,060
Fang,

405
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,740
at that time, our employees

406
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,420
will be laid off by at least one-third.

407
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,300
Adjusting business scope.

408
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
In mergers and acquisitions,

409
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
this is normal.

410
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,060
Normal?

411
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,420
Fang Xiewen,

412
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,620
from a small workshop

413
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,260
to such a large scale now,

414
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
it's the old employees of the company

415
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,900
who have borne with us.

416
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,220
Now, for more money,

417
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,260
you've decided

418
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,620
to fire them?

419
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,900
We no longer need

420
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,100
to talk about this.

421
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,700
I've decided.

422
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,100
Fang,

423
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,180
the company doesn't belong to you.

424
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,020
Now you're making decisions alone.

425
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,290
Is that appropriate?

426
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,540
My shares account for fifty-one percent.

427
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,740
I think it's appropriate.

428
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,820
Fang,

429
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,340
this is such an important decision.

430
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,580
Let's think about it again.

431
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,940
Who said the company

432
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,340
is the employees' second home?

433
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,460
Is this how you treat family members?

434
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,620
They won't get a penny less

435
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,540
for compensation.

436
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,080
Fine.

437
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,860
You'll run the company alone.

438
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,980
There's one more thing.

439
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,100
Let me tell you.

440
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
As long as Huang Yimei still holds

441
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,540
shares in our company,

442
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,860
she definitely wouldn't be as mercenary as you.

443
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,220
Hello?

444
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,060
Congratulations on your wedding.

445
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,620
Hello?

446
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,740
I might need to return to Beijing

447
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,860
for a couple of days.

448
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,780
I'll leave at noon.

449
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,340
I'll bring Taichu over to you later.

450
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,900
What are you joking about?

451
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,420
Everyone has to work.

452
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,580
How can I take her?

453
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,260
She can read and draw on the side by herself.

454
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,620
Huang Yimei,

455
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,620
what are you up to now?

456
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,340
You leave so suddenly.

457
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,060
Can't you be a responsible mother?

458
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,380
Something happened at home.

459
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,260
What happened?

460
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,780
Did something happen to your dad

461
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,740
or your mom?

462
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,220
My brother and Su.

463
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,980
I'll explain it when I get back, okay?

464
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
What could happen between them?

465
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,980
Focus on your own life, can't you?

466
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,940
Why do you meddle in other people's business?

467
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,260
Scold me when I return, alright?

468
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,300
Let me ask you.

469
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,060
Can you take care of her for two days?

470
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,580
The company isn't a daycare.

471
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,820
No one helps me look after the child.

472
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,940
Huang Yimei, listen to me.

473
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,140
Your home is in Shanghai.

474
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,260
You have a husband and a daughter.

475
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,300
You're a mother.

476
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,500
Why are you always thinking

477
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,660
about going out or to Beijing?

478
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,180
Can't you just stay at home?

479
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,340
I'm so busy right now.

480
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,500
Haven't drunk since then?

481
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,900
At that time,

482
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,740
marriage was my best choice.

483
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,060
Childhood sweethearts.

484
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,340
You knew him well,

485
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,420
and it could maximize your benefits.

486
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,020
It's normal to get to that point.

487
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,260
There's just one thing I don't understand.

488
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,820
You even told my brother about that.

489
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,020
Why did you keep this from him?

490
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,420
Initially, I didn't consider marrying him,

491
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,580
so we were just dating.

492
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,700
I didn't need to tell him that.

493
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,740
In the end,

494
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,780
it's my fault, really.

495
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,780
I don't even know what I was thinking.

496
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,620
How could I believe

497
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,860
I could ever get married?

498
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
You don't need to comfort me, really.

499
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,820
No need.

500
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,500
This is my fault.

501
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,820
I should take responsibility.

502
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,660
Please tell your brother for me.

503
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,260
We'll

504
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,860
just end it here. Let's separate.

505
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,380
(I took Taichu back to Beijing, Rose.)

506
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,140
Where did you go?

507
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,860
I left you a note.

508
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,700
Did I agree to this?

509
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,540
You took the child away without saying a word.

510
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,180
You couldn't look after her. I had no choice.

511
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,300
Huang Yimei,

512
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,620
you're going too far.

513
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,140
Are you running away

514
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,980
from home?

515
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,700
I told you I would be back

516
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
in two or three days
after finishing things here.

517
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,860
Who knows what you would do
or whom you would see there?

518
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,460
Taking the entire family along for cover.

519
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,340
Hello?

520
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,620
(Fang Xiewen, incoming call)

521
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,260
Hello, Mr. Fang.

522
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,740
Hello.

523
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
Book me a ticket.

524
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,700
The earliest flight to Beijing tomorrow.

525
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,420
Tomorrow?

526
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,020
Is that possible?

527
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,420
What's not possible?

528
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,620
Who's the boss here?

529
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,860
Mr. Fang.

530
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,100
You have a meeting about the merger
with Tianlangxing tomorrow afternoon.

531
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,660
Did she really say that?

532
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,100
To end things between us?

533
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,020
Or what else?

534
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,420
Apologize and beg for forgiveness?

535
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,620
With her character,

536
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,780
it's impossible.

537
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,780
I should be the one to end it.

538
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,900
I haven't done anything wrong.

539
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,140
She's taken the initiative.

540
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,260
It seems like I've lost.

541
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,900
Would you win if you initiated it?

542
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,140
If you get married and have children

543
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,020
but are still unhappy,

544
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,060
is that winning or losing?

545
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,540
Our parents loved each other all their lives.

546
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,140
What should marriage be like?

547
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,780
The answer has long been written for us.

548
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,580
Just follow it, right?

549
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,020
Every test is different.

550
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,780
When we got married,
we aimed for a perfect score.

551
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,060
Later, we found out passing was good enough.

552
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,140
I haven't even entered the exam room.

553
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,580
Do you want to retake the test?

554
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,380
If Su hadn't kept it from you,

555
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,220
if she'd told you she'd been married before,

556
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,780
would you still want to be with her?

557
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,060
Yes.

558
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,460
She was my dream school
for my college entrance examination.

559
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,820
Except for Tsinghua, nowhere else.

560
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,780
Did you know Ireland used to prohibit divorce?

561
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,980
But they could choose their marriage term.

562
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,780
From one year to a hundred years.

563
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,660
Choose freely.

564
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,980
The marriage would end when the time came.

565
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Did everyone choose a year then?

566
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
To try it out first.

567
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,220
The shorter the time, the higher the cost.

568
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,340
Why?

569
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,940
Maybe because earning money is easy.

570
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,300
But meeting someone

571
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,900
who wants you to marry for a hundred years

572
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,340
would be really hard.

573
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,420
Please enjoy.

574
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,620
Having a child is indeed different.

575
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,940
There's a charm as a mature woman.

576
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,500
You're complimenting me?

577
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,580
Of course.

578
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,260
Surely I'm complimenting you.

579
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,860
I can't scold you now.

580
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,780
I'm not your boss.

581
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,780
How have you been lately?

582
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,340
Su told me you returned to Beijing this year.

583
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,260
I've been with Gu in Hong Kong, China.

584
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,060
Then with his family,

585
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,820
we sent him to Switzerland.

586
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,140
He must have left very peacefully.

587
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,260
After that,

588
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,500
I traveled alone.

589
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,020
I went to Africa and South America.

590
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,820
There,

591
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,060
I liked attending strangers' funerals.

592
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,420
I went to see how the living

593
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,700
honor the dead

594
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
in strange ways.

595
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,340
Sometimes I wonder

596
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,580
what Gu's funeral

597
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,340
was like.

598
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
I didn't see him for the last time.

599
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,420
I didn't attend his funeral either.

600
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,740
Because I felt

601
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,460
that as long as I didn't see him in a coffin,

602
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,300
he wasn't dead.

603
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,980
He was just in the hospital.

604
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,140
I couldn't see him. That's all.

605
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,120
How long has it been
since you got your nails done?

606
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,380
Having someone tell me that is insincere.

607
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,420
So you're here to end it in person?

608
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,700
Aren't you women all about the ceremony?

609
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,580
Can't we have a little ceremony?

610
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,900
What ceremony?

611
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,580
You run.

612
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,100
You should know how marathons began.

613
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,060
One person ran 42.195 kilometers

614
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,980
just to deliver a message.

615
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,380
I have a message too.

616
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,940
You run a marathon with me,

617
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,220
and I'll tell you.

618
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,100
Come on.

619
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,740
You're panting after five kilometers.

620
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,340
Don't you know about your strength?

621
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,460
Don't worry about this.

622
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,780
Just tell me if you'll join me.
