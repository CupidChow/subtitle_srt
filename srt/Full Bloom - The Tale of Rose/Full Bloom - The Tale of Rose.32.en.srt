00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,750
Huang Yimei,

4
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,250
let's break up.

5
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,280
What did you say?

6
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,970
My heart

7
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,600
might stop working anytime.

8
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,160
Don't waste time on me.

9
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,930
From childhood till now,

10
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,760
I've visited the underworld many times.

11
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,250
I thought Yama

12
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,880
would issue me a household register,

13
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,410
but ended up with a temporary permit.

14
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,000
I have a feeling

15
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,810
that if I go again this time,

16
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,440
he won't let me out.

17
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,040
With my health condition,

18
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,720
I can't love anyone.

19
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,370
I don't care.

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,560
That's because you're brave.

21
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,760
If I didn't care,

22
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,130
I'd be a jerk.

This exhibition is a large experiment.

52
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,290
Through this exhibition,

53
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,640
I hope to awaken people's yearning
for freedom and art.

54
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,000
That's a good idea.

55
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,100
I like it.

56
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,520
Such a beautiful face

57
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,810
must appear in my work.

58
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,810
Excuse me.

59
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,510
Wait a moment.

60
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,830
Huang Yimei.

61
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,730
Tina, I'm sorry.

62
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,780
I was going to photocopy the documents.

63
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,760
I didn't know you were there.

64
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,400
It's okay. You go ahead.

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,660
He's just an art student.

66
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,170
Just graduated, studying sculpture.

67
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,810
I'm discussing a collaboration with him.

68
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,990
Let's go. I'll introduce you.

69
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,850
Next time.

70
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,080
Fu Jiaming, right?

71
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,250
Tell me.

72
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,960
When it comes to life and death,

73
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,430
who suffers more,

74
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,490
the living

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,200
or the dead?

76
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,370
Why are you so pessimistic?

77
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,320
Isn't everything okay now?

78
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,620
Maybe it's my first time

79
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,850
coming this close to death.

80
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,550
Tina,

81
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,850
when you were with Gu,

82
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,610
how did you feel?

83
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,960
It was cruel

84
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,440
yet beautiful.

85
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,560
Only the two of us were left in the world.

86
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,390
No more meetings, stock investments,

87
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,960
and all that mess.

88
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,960
Just tea,

89
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,640
chatting,

90
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,550
and art.

91
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,850
In all the years I spent with Gu,

92
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,190
only during that time

93
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,130
did I have a world for two.

94
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,780
A few days ago, I met a friend,

95
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,200
a mutual friend of ours.

96
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,640
He talked to me about Gu.

97
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,690
I said,

98
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,400
"I love him."

99
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,820
He said, "You shouldn't say that.

100
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,280
You should say you loved him."

101
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,000
I said, "I know,

102
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,230
but the past tense

103
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,130
can't accurately express my feelings."

104
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,210
He's gone,

105
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,680
but I still love him.

106
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,570
When nearing death,

107
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,130
one's feelings become clearer.

108
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,730
That's why I said it was beautiful.

109
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,620
I didn't learn skiing as a kid,

110
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,390
but those kids from the company

111
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,970
took me straight to the intermediate slope.

112
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,800
I wanted to take a peek at how high it was,

113
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,610
but I slipped down accidentally.

114
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,710
It felt like riding on a somersault cloud,

115
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,150
but it was different.

116
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,900
I did the flips myself.

117
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,640
God knows how many flips I did.

118
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,270
Bro,

119
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,370
you crack me up.

120
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,090
I'll go outside for a while,

121
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,490
or my wound would be cracked open.

122
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,210
You continue.

123
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,610
I'll go to the bathroom.

124
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,790
Take it easy.

125
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,250
- Alright.
- Slow down.

126
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,130
- Fu.
- I broke up with Huang Yimei.

127
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,160
I know what you want to say.

128
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,070
Don't worry,

129
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,680
I don't want to drag her down.

130
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,130
As an elder brother,

131
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,700
I understand

132
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,700
your feelings.

133
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,950
Thank you.

134
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,340
Fu,

135
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,790
I...

136
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,860
Fu Jiaming!

137
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,450
Fu Jiaming, I bought a cake for you.

138
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,620
Uncle, why are you here too?

139
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,520
Taichu is here.

140
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,310
Fang Taichu,

141
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,070
how did you know I wanted a cake?

142
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,660
Open it. Let's eat together.

143
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,500
Okay.

144
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,400
It's so big.

145
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,910
Thank you.

146
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's eat together.

147
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,520
It's really delicious.

148
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,330
What brings you here?

149
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,520
I came to see Fu.

150
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,610
When did you get so close?

151
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,880
Sneaking behind my back to see him?

152
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,570
What did you say to him?

153
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,850
He said he broke up with you.

154
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,310
Yes.

155
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,970
That was his decision.

156
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,580
Not mine.

157
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,880
Is it worth doing this?

158
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
Zhenhua,

159
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,400
you know me.

160
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,210
In my opinion,

161
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,680
it's not about worth.

162
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,280
You wanted to break up with me.

163
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,580
I don't accept it.

164
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,950
Huang Yimei.

165
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,520
Going to say you don't deserve it again?

166
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,030
Fu Jiaming, why are you so cowardly?

167
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,920
You're not dying tomorrow.
What are you afraid of?

168
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,610
I can accept being separated by death,

169
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,730
but not by cowardice.

170
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,400
Don't try to shake me off.

171
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,970
Don't try to be a coward.

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,280
I saw an old friend.

193
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,910
Taichu,

194
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,430
have you played the game

195
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,130
I installed for you last time?

196
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,850
The one developed by my company.

197
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,370
It's not fun. It's too hard.

198
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,570
When you grow up, you'll like it.

199
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,350
What games have you been playing?

200
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,210
Daddy, wait a minute.

201
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,680
My daughter can play the piano.

202
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,730
You play so well.

203
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,740
What's the name of this song?

204
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,070
Taotao.

205
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,910
Taotao?

206
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,760
Is that your little bunny?

207
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,730
Taotao is dead.

208
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,680
Fu Jiaming wrote this song for it.

209
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,370
After Fu Jiaming dies,

210
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,210
I will also write him a song.

211
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,330
Is Fu Jiaming

212
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,850
going to die?

213
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,990
Mommy says everyone will die.

214
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,990
Mommy will die.

215
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,020
Daddy will die.

216
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,680
Taichu will die too.

217
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,310
I said I'm scared.

218
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,150
Mommy wants me

219
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,570
to play with friends, so I won't be scared.

220
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,110
Don't be scared.

221
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,160
Taichu, don't be scared.

222
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,450
Mommy's talking nonsense.

223
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,970
Taichu won't die.

224
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,520
Mommy and Daddy won't die either.

225
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,770
I'll take a call.

226
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,550
Hello.

227
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,470
What nonsense are you talking to Taichu?

228
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,310
What?

229
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,910
I don't want my daughter

230
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,810
to see your boyfriend again.

231
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,240
What are you telling her?

232
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,570
Why tell her everyone will die?

233
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,570
I'm explaining the concept of life.

234
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,430
She's only five.

235
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,050
She doesn't need to know these things.

236
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,880
Kids at her age understand a lot of things.

237
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,710
When she grows up, she'll understand.

238
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,260
Why are you telling her now?

239
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,820
What illness and death?

240
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,370
Do you know she's scared?

241
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,510
She asked about it.

242
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,680
It means she knows death is real.

243
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,100
Children have strong neural repair functions.

244
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,340
Don't use your psychology

245
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
with me.

246
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,430
My daughter is still young.

247
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,270
I don't want you

248
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,330
to instill these dark things into her.

249
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,370
Girls should be raised well, understand?

250
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,990
Let her grow up carefree, can't you?

251
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,780
Why scare her?

252
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,740
This isn't raising her well.

253
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,060
It's spoiling her.

254
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,910
That's my daughter.

255
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,200
If I say no, it means no.

256
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,240
Taichu hasn't been here for a long time.

257
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,200
When will you bring her over?

258
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,160
If you're busy,
I'll let Xiao Xiaoyu pick her up.

259
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,640
Calm down first.

260
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,680
Don't use our child to argue with me, okay?

261
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,910
I'm not arguing with you.

262
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,140
I want to see my daughter.

263
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,340
I want to compensate her.

264
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,100
Taichu hasn't been with me for so long.

265
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,940
I'm worried about her.

266
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,640
Then I'll arrange it.

267
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,240
I'll have to take leave from kindergarten.

268
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,090
Okay, arrange it as soon as possible.

269
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,620
Leave it.

270
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,380
(Emergency)

271
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,920
What are you thinking?

272
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,960
Wrote a few songs during the hospitalization.

273
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll finish them as soon as possible,

274
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,290
so your exhibition could use them.

275
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,920
You just left the hospital.

276
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,290
I can't lie down anymore.

277
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,180
Okay.

278
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,810
Work hard for me.

279
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,610
Yes, Ms. Huang is really domineering.

280
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,250
Sure. I am the client.

281
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,380
You're the first woman

282
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,020
to force yourself on me.

283
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,500
What?

284
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,940
You want a second one?

285
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,460
No, no. I don't dare.

286
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,780
Do you know

287
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
about the last disciple?

288
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,700
Huang Yimei,

289
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,380
you are my last lover.

290
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,620
The last one

291
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,620
of my life.

292
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,100
(Speed Dial)

293
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,340
(Mom)

294
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,460
Come on. Eight.

295
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,300
(Son)

296
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,460
Wait, wait.

297
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,240
- Mom.
- Wait for me.

298
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,100
I want to discuss something with you.

299
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,380
Can you

300
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,180
move to Shanghai?

301
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,780
Why?

302
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,940
Why should I move to Shanghai?

303
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm busy here.

304
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,220
I have things to do here.

305
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,220
I want

306
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,420
to get Taichu back.

307
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,340
You know

308
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,460
I'm usually busy with work.

309
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,260
Someone has to take care of her.

310
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,940
Why do you bring her over?

311
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,380
Her mother got her after the divorce.

312
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,020
I don't want to serve a girl.

313
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,860
I won't go.

314
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,060
Besides, you've paid alimony.

315
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,140
Why did you bring her over?

316
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,700
This is a job her mom should do.

317
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,780
Why should you

318
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,060
interfere in everything?

319
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,620
Xiewen,

320
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,940
seriously.

321
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,380
You're over thirty now.

322
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,660
Hurry up

323
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,500
and get married

324
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,140
to have a big, healthy son.

325
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Live a steady life. That's what matters.

326
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,260
Don't find someone like her mom.

327
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,500
She's too pretty

328
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,580
to be a wife.

329
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,020
She can't stay at home.

330
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
That won't work.

331
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,140
Mom, enough already.

332
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,620
I have work to finish here.

333
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,940
We'll talk later.

334
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,580
Last week, I finalized the contract
with Shu Tianyu.

335
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,660
The agreement's done today.

336
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,580
She's confirmed it too.

337
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,420
Two copies are ready.

338
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,820
Take a look. Sign it if it's okay.

339
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,140
I'll send it by express tomorrow.

340
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,140
One more thing.

341
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
Mr. Song bought "1024"

342
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,900
at the art exhibition last time.

343
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,620
He wants a custom oil painting
from the same series.

344
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
I've already contacted the artist

345
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,860
and discussed the creative requirements.

346
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,700
He agreed.

347
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,260
Huang Yimei,

348
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
do you think the world will stop

349
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
without you two?

350
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,700
He just got out of the hospital.

351
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,780
Can't you rest with him?

352
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,140
Don't always think about work.

353
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,420
For me,

354
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,940
work is rest.

355
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,020
For him, that's not work.

356
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,420
What do you think?

357
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,820
This sculpture is quite interesting.

358
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,340
Look.

359
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,300
Different angles give different feelings,

360
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,060
but can we leave a large space on the base

361
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,460
for equipment without affecting

362
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,740
the load-bearing?

363
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,500
Then I'll have to see

364
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,100
how your music's coming along

365
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,460
before I make the decision.

366
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,380
I understand.

367
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,460
I'll revise it until you're satisfied.

368
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,380
It's my first time for this kind of exhibition.

369
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,580
I don't know what the final presentation

370
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,780
will be like.

371
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,820
Regardless of the outcome,

372
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,860
for me,

373
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,820
working with you

374
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,300
is the most meaningful part of this.

375
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,420
Do you dare

376
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,020
to take a risk with me?

377
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,220
Boss, give me a beer.

378
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,220
Is this the risk you were talking about?

379
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,060
For me, it is.

380
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,380
I've never had a spicy hot pot before.

381
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,580
The doctor said to watch your diet.

382
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Can you handle all this oil and salt?

383
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,060
Afraid I'll die?

384
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,820
It's just one meal.

385
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,700
Hello, sir. Are there two of you?

386
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,140
- Yes.
- There's a table here.

387
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,420
- Okay.
- Follow me.

388
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,260
Come on.

389
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,060
Here.

390
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,340
Thank you.

391
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,420
What kind of soup base would you like?

392
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,060
We have mild, medium, and devilishly spicy.

393
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,220
Devilishly spicy.

394
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,180
Are you crazy?

395
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,300
Maybe this will be the only time in my life

396
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,700
I eat such a spicy hot pot.

397
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,020
I have to challenge the spiciest.

398
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
What is good here?

399
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,900
We have pig brains,

400
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,420
duck intestines, shrimp balls, and loin slices.

401
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,060
Some fresh vegetables are nice too.

402
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,140
- Everything you mentioned.
- Sure.

403
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,380
- I'll add more if it's not enough.
- Okay.

404
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,260
Thank you.

405
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,940
You shouldn't neglect your health.

406
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,340
Huang Yimei,

407
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,100
you said

408
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,620
you could accept separation by death

409
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,660
but not by cowardice.

410
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm the same.

411
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,420
I can accept living

412
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,660
like a normal person,

413
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,380
being a normal boyfriend to you,

414
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,180
but I can't accept living

415
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,380
like I'm under constant care,

416
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,820
living cautiously every day.

417
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,860
Do you understand?

418
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,780
Boss, give me a beer.

419
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,820
Do you know how to mix the sauce?

420
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,860
Is it okay?

421
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,020
Cool.

422
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,100
Cool.

423
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Truly devilishly spicy.

424
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,660
You know.

425
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,140
I heard people say

426
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,460
sometimes spiciness

427
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,860
isn't just a taste.

428
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,420
It's a kind of pain.

429
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,980
Let's go.

430
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,140
What do you want to eat later?

431
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,100
Xiaohe.

432
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,940
Zhenhua.

433
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,900
It's really you, Xiaohe.

434
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,620
Long time no see.

435
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,140
Yeah, what a coincidence.

436
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,420
Long time no see.

437
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,580
This is...

438
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,580
This is my son.

439
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,380
Lele, say hello to Uncle.

440
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,060
Hello, Uncle.

441
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,900
Hello.

442
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,500
You have a son now.

443
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,340
Yes.

444
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,780
What are you doing now?

445
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,140
I remember you were going

446
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,580
to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, right?

447
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,420
I didn't go.

448
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,820
I took a job in Shenzhen.

449
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,660
Professor Liang was rehired,

450
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,860
so I returned to the university with my son.

451
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,900
We haven't been in touch for so many years.

452
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,380
I didn't know you went to Shenzhen.

453
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,140
I just remember

454
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,340
you loved doing experiments in the lab.

455
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,180
Do you remember back then?

456
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,020
You said I was a crazy doctor.

457
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,380
So now you live around here?

458
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,700
Yeah.

459
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,660
Because of my child,

460
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,460
the department gave me a one-bedroom.

461
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,900
But we also have a house off-campus.

462
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,140
On weekends, I take him back to stay there.

463
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,140
A one-bedroom?

464
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,780
Can a family of three fit?

465
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,580
Just me and Lele.

466
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,490
We don't need that much space.

467
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,140
Where's the child's father?

468
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,860
Mommy, I'm hungry.

469
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,940
Hungry?

470
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,300
I bought some ready-to-eat food.

471
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,540
- Take it home and eat.
- No need.

472
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,820
I'll take him out to eat.

473
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,660
Thank Uncle.

474
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,420
Goodbye, Uncle.

475
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
So hungry?

476
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,460
Let's go then.

477
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,100
Let's go.

478
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,380
Goodbye.

479
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,460
Okay, goodbye.

480
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,140
Let's go.

481
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,700
No green onions? Okay.

482
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,820
Taichu will go to Shanghai in a few days.

483
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,380
Rose will stay with Jiaming.

484
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,220
Only the two of us will be at home.

485
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
We can't finish all this food.

486
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,100
- Right.
- Take some back later.

487
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,860
We'll buy more if we want to eat.

488
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,980
Mom,

489
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,900
I saw Bai Xiaohe downstairs just now.

490
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
She went back to Professor Liang's lab.

491
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,940
Did you know that?

492
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,660
Did you know she has a son now?

493
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,060
Her son goes to the kindergarten here.

494
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,300
When did you find out?

495
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,380
Why didn't you tell me?

496
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,660
Why tell you?

497
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,460
Do you know who she married?

498
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,300
I don't know.

499
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,660
Isn't her dad a shareholder in your company?

500
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,740
Didn't he tell you?

501
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,620
Why tell me this?

502
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,060
We only talk about work.

503
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,020
Nothing else besides budgeting and settlement.

504
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,740
Maybe her dad also thinks

505
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,140
you're already married,

506
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,100
so Xiaohe has nothing to do with you anymore.

507
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,620
Her son looks older than Taichu.

508
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,940
He must be five or six years old.

509
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,940
You love roast duck.

510
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,180
Hurry up and eat.

511
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,180
Eat some dishes later.

512
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,660
Mommy,

513
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,700
I want to give this puppy picture to Daddy.

514
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,020
You keep it safe, okay?

515
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,980
Give it to him yourself.

516
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,540
Let's put the picture in your backpack.

517
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,300
He's really lucky.

518
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,260
Caught the wave of the industry.

519
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,380
Now he's quite established.

520
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,540
You planted a big tree

521
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,900
but let others enjoy its shade.

522
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,580
He was always a big tree.

523
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,940
His success today

524
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,900
depends on his talents and skills.

525
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,620
As for who benefits from it,

526
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
it's none of my concern.

527
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,860
Rest assured.

528
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,060
This is the one who benefits?

529
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,340
Talk to you later.

530
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,740
Ms. Xiaoyu.

531
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,980
Sorry to trouble you again.

532
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,850
No trouble at all.

533
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,500
Mr. Fang can't be here due to meetings.

534
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,260
Or he'd come to pick up Taichu himself.

535
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
He's so busy.

536
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,140
Maybe Taichu shouldn't go back.

537
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,460
Otherwise, she'll be alone.

538
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,300
That'll be hard for her.

539
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,420
Mr. Fang is rushing

540
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,020
to make time for Taichu.

541
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,060
Even if he doesn't have time,

542
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,980
I'll be there for her.

543
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,580
Don't worry. She won't be alone.

544
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,380
Sure. Sorry to trouble you.

545
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,580
My pleasure. Taichu is a good girl.

546
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,500
Do you want to go to the amusement park?

547
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,460
Is it the one from last time?

548
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,660
Sure.

549
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,540
Hold onto Daddy and Ms. Xiaoyu's hands

550
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,620
when you go out.

551
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,740
Don't run around.

552
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,180
Say goodbye to Mommy and Uncle.

553
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,740
Bye-bye, Taichu.

554
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,060
Bye-bye.

555
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,340
Taichu, look.

556
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,580
I got you lots of new games.

557
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,180
This game here.

558
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,700
It's from Dad's company.

559
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,220
Taichu, play by yourself.

560
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,100
Coming.

561
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,900
Mr. Fang.

562
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
Come in.

563
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,620
- Give it to me.
- Thank you.

564
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,420
Change your shoes.

565
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,500
Bought so much.

566
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,140
Taichu, I bought you some goodies.

567
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,420
Ms. Xiaoyu.

568
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,620
These are Taichu's favorites.

569
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,420
Fried chicken.

570
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,460
Taichu.

571
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,300
Time for dinner. Come.

572
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,620
After dinner,

573
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,220
I will play with you, okay?

574
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,140
Come on. Let's go.

575
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,220
Fried chicken.

576
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,740
Xiaoyu,

577
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,660
thank you.

578
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,100
You can go home now.

579
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,180
Ms. Xiaoyu, do you want some fried chicken?

580
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,740
Taichu, you eat.

581
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,820
Ms. Xiaoyu still has work to do.

582
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,780
Right.

583
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,260
Tell the driver tomorrow

584
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,900
not to come too early.

585
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,940
I'll have breakfast with Taichu.

586
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
Okay, Mr. Fang.

587
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,300
You two go ahead and eat.

588
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,580
Call me if you need anything.

589
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,420
Sure, go ahead.

590
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,500
Goodbye, Ms. Xiaoyu.

591
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,540
Goodbye.

592
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,340
Is it delicious, Taichu?

593
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,580
Are you still in the field?

594
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,140
Mommy.

595
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,460
Your daughter?

596
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,300
Yes.

597
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,900
How old is she?

598
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,140
Five years old.

599
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm waiting for my husband's car,

600
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,740
so...

601
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,620
I'm in a hurry too.

602
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,120
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

603
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,780
Mommy, I'm six years old this year.

604
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,820
Sorry, I often get it wrong.

605
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,980
Long time no see.

606
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,300
Long time no see.

607
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,380
This is...

608
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,580
This is my son.

609
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,220
Lele, say hello to Uncle.

610
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,700
Hello, Uncle.

611
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,820
It's impossible.

612
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,500
Tell me. What's going on?

613
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,140
I saw Bai Xiaohe.

614
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,060
Xiaohe.

615
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,740
It's really you.

616
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
I saw someone who looked like you over there.

617
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,900
Long time no see.

618
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,620
One, two, three.

619
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,460
It's quite far away.

620
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,500
Like this.

621
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,020
Then reel in the line.

622
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,020
While reeling it in,

623
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,100
lift the rod

624
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,940
like this.

625
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,980
Steamed sea bass is delicious.

626
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,780
I don't know how to cook it.

627
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,540
It's very simple.

628
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,180
Why don't you come to my place?
Let's eat together.

629
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,700
Sprinkle cilantro and green onions.

630
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,300
Let it sit for a few seconds.

631
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,700
There.

632
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,260
Take the fish out.

633
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,100
Be careful.

634
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,380
Pour the sauce made before

635
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,340
and hot oil

636
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,060
over it.

637
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,900
Try it.

638
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,820
Smells great.

639
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,500
Tastes good.

640
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,180
Good indeed.

641
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,500
I may not be as good at cooking as you,

642
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,180
but I think I'm quite handy.

643
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,900
I can handle

644
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,260
most small life issues,

645
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,220
except for a few unsolvable ones.

646
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,420
I enjoy being single.

647
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,940
What unsolvable issues?

648
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,540
Nothing.

649
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,140
Tell me. Maybe I can help.

650
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,940
That day, I was drinking alcohol.

651
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,180
What unsolvable issues?

652
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,260
Tell me. Maybe I can help.

653
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,180
I love children.

654
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,540
Really.

655
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,540
You like children?

656
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,580
Well,

657
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,660
I didn't

658
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,660
expect that.

659
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,980
Don't mess around in the lab

660
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,380
to make a baby.

661
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,220
Well...

662
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,220
Sci-fi movies show

663
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,860
that scientists

664
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,540
create many monsters.

665
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,580
You can't do that.

666
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,140
Don't worry.

667
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,700
I don't have that capability.

668
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,140
But the thought

669
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,900
of needing to date

670
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,820
and marry a man first to have a child

671
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,980
seems troublesome.

672
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,260
I wonder if I'll regret it,

673
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,900
or

674
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,220
compromise with reality.

675
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
Well,

676
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,140
you want a kid,

677
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,980
and...

678
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,540
