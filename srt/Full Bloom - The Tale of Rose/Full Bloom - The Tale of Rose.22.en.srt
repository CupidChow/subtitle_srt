3
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,740
Here.

4
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,910
Come in, please.

5
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,300
Great.

6
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,620
Alright, Ms. Su,

7
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,830
please sign here.

(Signed by the recipient: Su Gengsheng)

9
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,830
Alright, here are your keys.

10
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,740
Thank you.

11
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,740
Enjoy your new home.

12
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,180
Thank you.

13
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,310
- I'll walk him out.
- No need, no need.

14
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,150
Thank you.

15
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,460
What's wrong?

16
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,110
What's wrong?

17
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,340
There, there.

18
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,340
It's alright.

19
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
What's the matter?

20
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,990
Su's Mansion, right?

21
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
(Su)

22
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,270
The kitchen area is a bit small.

23
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,500
This wall isn't load-bearing.

24
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,540
It can be taken down.

25
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,100
You'll just lose a room,

26
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,300
but you can connect

27
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,540
the kitchen and dining area.

28
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,830
It will be an open kitchen.

29
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,900
It'll look great.

30
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,340
You can place a sofa here,

31
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,420
hang a painting there,

32
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,070
and put a TV cabinet

33
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,140
and TV over here.

34
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,900
Let's check out the bathroom.

35
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,780
This bathroom

36
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,070
isn't convenient.

37
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,340
This isn't a load-bearing wall either.

38
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,540
We can close this door

39
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,300
and open one here.

40
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,340
We can even install a bathtub.

41
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,950
A bath after work every day sounds nice.

42
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,790
No.

43
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,460
It's too small.
A shower is more convenient.

44
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,380
True.

45
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,100
Finding the right size might be tricky.

46
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,190
Let's stop here for today.

47
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,390
I'll find a renovation company
in a while.

48
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,900
When the time comes,
help me with the design.

49
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,190
No problem with the design.

50
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,590
Let's not wait too long.

51
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,340
Let's start after the Chinese New Year.

52
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,860
I don't have time
to supervise the renovation.

53
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
I'll make the designs,

54
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,340
so I'll have to supervise.

55
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,340
Renovations take time.

56
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,100
I can't trouble you every day.

57
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,590
Don't mention that between us.

58
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,700
Besides,

59
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,070
my work issues aren't resolved yet.

60
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,750
If you trust my taste,

61
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
leave the renovation to me.

62
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,190
How did you lose weight since last week?

63
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,360
- Really?
- Yes.

64
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,780
Don't listen to your brother

65
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,300
and have a diet.

66
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,380
Eat when you should.

67
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,070
I'm not having a diet.

68
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,630
I haven't missed a meal.

69
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,420
I'll buy you some bread

70
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,510
and cookies tomorrow.

71
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,420
Take them to work

72
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,470
and eat when you're hungry.

73
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,900
My desk

74
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,070
already looks like a mini-mart.

75
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,910
And you want to buy more?

76
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,420
Then it's the work that's exhausting you.

77
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,190
I saw you busy

78
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,900
when I brought you lunch the other day.

79
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,350
Have some fruit.

80
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,750
Our company just established
an e-book distribution department.

81
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,350
As the supervisor, I have to manage it.

82
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,460
You're always so proud,

83
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,270
taking on too much.

84
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,150
E-books have market potential.

85
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,780
You told me that.

86
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,590
Yes, I told you.

87
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,300
I remember.

88
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,420
Tell your boss

89
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,100
to move the printers

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
and copiers

91
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,900
away from your desk.

92
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,940
They emit radiation.

93
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,980
And use your phone less.

94
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,940
It also has radiation.

95
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,030
Actually,

96
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,860
the company is pretty stable now.

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,460
You don't have to work.
I can support you.

98
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,660
Good for you, Mr. Fang.

99
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,220
Hear that? Your dad
will make you a rich kid.

100
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,710
You're always teasing me.

101
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,300
Sorry I've been too busy

102
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,830
to take care of you.

103
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,270
Should I ask my mom to come over?

104
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,860
No need to make a fuss.

105
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,750
I promise I'll eat and sleep well

106
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,780
and gain weight.

107
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,060
Eat more.

108
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,380
I didn't expect

109
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,660
such changes in Cyan

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,860
in just a few months.

111
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,660
But these changes

112
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,270
won't affect our collaboration.

113
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,590
So, you're willing to collaborate?

114
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
I just took over,

115
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,980
and I need a noteworthy achievement.

116
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,780
I value

117
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,710
the friendly city arts exchange project

118
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,630
you mentioned last time.

119
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,460
It's been approved by the headquarters.

120
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,540
No wonder Huang Yimei always praises you

121
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,540
for being straightforward.

122
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,820
You live up to that reputation.

123
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,420
Then you must understand

124
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,750
that even if we collaborate,

125
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,780
I won't put in a good word for you

126
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,340
with Huang Yimei.

127
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,430
Please have a seat.

128
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,870
This project

129
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,230
is large-scale and long-term.

130
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,390
One company can't handle it alone.

131
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,630
I've looked into it.

132
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,990
You've contacted other companies.

133
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,940
Among them,

134
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,540
Cyan has the richest resources
in Beijing,

135
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,820
Shanghai, and Hong Kong, China.

136
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,510
I hope to be responsible
for these cities.

137
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,030
You're right,

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,820
and that's exactly what I planned.

139
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,350
Great.

140
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,510
We will

141
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,060
do our best professionally,

142
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,270
but I won't assist with personal matters.

143
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,110
Alright, I'll have a colleague
liaise with you.

144
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,180
Someone you're familiar with.

145
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,750
Come to my office.

146
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,020
Come in.

147
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,620
Eric,

148
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,900
long time no see.

149
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,020
Nice to see you again.

150
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,660
Galant has a friendly city art project

151
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,580
in the Asia-Pacific region,

152
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,630
and we're one of
the collaborating companies.

153
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,510
I want to assign this project to you.

154
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,710
Me?

155
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,660
Any problem?

156
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,870
No.

157
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,590
If the project is handed to me,

158
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,900
I'll see it through to the end.

159
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,820
(Chatting)

160
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,750
The doctor said
the baby is developing very well.

161
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,070
Rose.

162
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,950
How are you?

163
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,940
Your face looks thinner.

164
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,580
I'm fine.

165
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,300
Dad, Mom,

166
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,270
you really need to talk to Rose.

167
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,150
She's already exhausted from work,

168
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,660
and she still works overtime at home.

169
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,780
Rose,

170
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,700
you really should listen to Fang.

171
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,830
Don't overwork yourself.

172
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,300
Think about the child.

173
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,900
And Mom, Dad,

174
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,990
look at her
carrying that computer all day.

175
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,030
They have so many computers,

176
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,630
copiers, and printers in their office.

177
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
I bought her an anti-radiation suit,

178
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,580
but she won't wear it.

179
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,660
That thing is unnecessary.

180
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,580
Ionizing radiation is harmful
to the human body.

181
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,990
The electromagnetic radiation
from those electronic devices

182
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,660
is orders of magnitude lower

183
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,270
than the bond energies of human body.

184
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,230
But look,

185
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,540
with so many mobile base stations now,

186
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,180
there are a lot of radiation sources.

187
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,180
Accumulated exposure will have an impact.

188
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,780
There's no correlation with accumulation.

189
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,230
A bridge designed to hold 100 tons

190
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,780
won't collapse

191
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,660
just because 100 cars weighing a ton each

192
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,870
pass over it.

193
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,700
Fang, let me tell you.

194
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,900
The anti-radiation suit
is just for peace of mind.

195
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,580
If you really make my sister wear it,

196
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,780
it'll be a disgrace
to our physics professor.

197
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,900
No need to wear it.

198
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,310
Rose,

199
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,420
why have you lost weight?

200
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,180
Now is the time to eat more.

201
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
You shouldn't be dieting.

202
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,390
Eat more nutritious food

203
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,110
to conceive

204
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,150
a healthy baby like me.

205
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,140
Okay.

206
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,750
Eat more.

207
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,630
Listen to your brother.

208
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,230
Eat nutritious food.

209
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,660
Try to eat more.

210
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,780
What's wrong?

211
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,830
Does your family

212
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,390
look down on me?

213
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,350
How could they?

214
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,630
They always say you're hardworking,

215
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,700
dedicated,

216
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,060
always praising you.

217
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,110
I'm stupid.

218
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,750
What's the use of being hardworking?

219
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,990
After so many years of study,

220
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,300
I can't even understand ionizing
and electromagnetic radiation.

221
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,180
Isn't that normal?

222
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,300
Who buys clothes after researching

223
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,420
and gathering data?

224
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,630
My brother has a sharp tongue.

225
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,750
He teases you
because he considers you family.

226
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,590
Don't overthink it.

227
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,780
Zhenhua,

228
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,660
you finally show up.

229
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,990
Haven't seen you for days.

230
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,030
Where have you been?

231
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,780
Been quite busy lately.

232
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,660
Today I came to take a leave.

233
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,870
Are you taking on private jobs?

234
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,350
Take me with you.

235
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,700
I am.

236
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,630
But this time, I won't take you along.

237
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,350
No money to earn
and I'd have to slave away.

238
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,190
Got screwed?

239
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,300
I'm helping my girlfriend
decorate a house.

240
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,140
I have no choice.

241
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,270
She doesn't trust others,

242
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,230
so it has to be me.

243
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,150
New house?

244
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,580
Good things are coming?

245
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,590
Not so fast.

246
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,140
Just

247
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,110
preparing in advance.

248
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,130
(Su)
Where's Foreman Liu?

249
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,990
The boss is here.

250
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,510
Here, I brought water for everyone.

251
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,470
Help yourself.

252
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,900
- Help yourself.
- Thanks, boss.

253
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,660
Hello?

254
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,130
We have two types of floor tiles now,

255
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,020
similar colors.

256
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,820
One is imported,
and the other is domestic.

257
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,540
But there's a fifty yuan
difference per tile.

258
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,900
Alright, I'm fine with either.

259
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,140
Then I'll choose the imported one.

260
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,190
Alright, imported it is.

261
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,620
Do you prefer a direct suction range hood
or a side suction one?

262
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,700
Either is fine. I don't really cook.

263
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,620
I think side suction is better.

264
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,740
Okay, side suction it is.

265
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,060
Side suction it is.

266
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,860
Let's take another look.

267
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,580
- Hello?
- I sent you an email

268
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,340
to confirm the wallpaper design.

269
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,500
Not now. I'm busy right now.

270
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
You said I could leave
the renovation to you.

271
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,740
You decide everything.

272
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,890
No need to ask me about every detail.

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,860
Do you think I'm the palace eunuch?

274
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,700
Miss, what's wrong?

275
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,260
What's wrong with you?

276
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
(Outpatient Department, Huashan Hospital,
Fudan University)

277
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,500
Yimei.

278
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,140
Go back. I'm fine now.

279
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,100
You suddenly fainted this morning

280
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,420
and scared us all.

281
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,260
If I leave you alone here,

282
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,820
the editor will scold me.

283
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,940
My husband is already here.

284
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
Go back and thank everyone for me.

285
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,340
Thanks.

286
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,540
Doctor.

287
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,210
Your blood pressure
and urine protein are a bit high.

288
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,100
Was there convulsion?

289
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,020
No.

290
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,780
Suspicion of pre-eclampsia.

291
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,980
Well.

292
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Doctor...

293
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,820
The symptoms aren't severe now.

294
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,620
If you're worried,

295
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,180
you can stay in the hospital
for 48 hours of observation.

296
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,460
Okay, okay, okay.

297
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,700
Can I stay for a day?

298
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,820
You have medical insurance.

299
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,060
Most of the hospitalization expenses
can be reimbursed.

300
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,820
Doctor, two days it is.

301
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,700
Thanks, Doctor.

302
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,660
Don't worry about the money.

303
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,340
Health is more important.

304
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,580
There's a meeting with an important author
the day after tomorrow.

305
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,220
Are you worried about work?

306
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,500
It's really important.

307
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,100
What is more important,
your work or health?

308
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,900
The doctor said

309
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,020
you have pre-eclampsia.

310
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,220
How can the company
let you go to work like this?

311
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,660
Tomorrow afternoon,

312
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,300
I'll help you apply for leave
at your company.

313
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,620
Stay in the hospital these two days,

314
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,380
and have a thorough examination.

315
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,540
Pre-eclampsia?

316
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,420
This is not a small issue.

317
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,940
Yeah, it's just a suspicion for now.

318
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,020
But the doctor also said
to rest in bed as much as possible.

319
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,620
How long do you plan to take off?

320
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,180
May I ask

321
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,420
how much longer she can take leave?

322
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,660
We have 12 days
of paid sick leave annually.

323
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,620
Beyond that, it's unpaid leave.

324
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,460
And if it's more than a month?

325
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,420
Then it's recommended
to take unpaid leave,

326
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
but Huang isn't a regular staff yet.

327
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,180
That makes it difficult.

328
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,980
Maybe

329
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,220
she could resign.

330
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,220
That would be a pity.

331
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,580
How about this?

332
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,860
She can apply for a transfer first.

333
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
There are still over four months
until the due date.

334
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,660
If it gets serious,

335
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,980
she'll need to rest in bed

336
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,580
and probably won't be able to work.

337
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,020
Does she agree?

338
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,620
She's usually so active at work,

339
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,740
doing so well.

340
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,860
Yes,

341
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,020
she's very diligent

342
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,700
and dedicated to her work.

343
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,940
That's why I'm more worried.

344
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm her husband.

345
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,300
We're in Shanghai, just the two of us,

346
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,620
no other relatives around.

347
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,860
I'm worried I won't be able
to take care of her well.

348
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,540
If something more serious happens

349
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,340
because of this...

350
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,260
Right?

351
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,300
I hope you can understand.

352
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,820
Choose one of these three curtains.

353
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,620
You decide.

354
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,700
I've printed them all out. Take a look.

355
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,220
You might not like the one I choose.

356
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,580
The first one.

357
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,780
So hasty.
How about taking a look carefully?

358
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I trust my instincts.

359
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,620
The first impression is often the best.

360
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,180
When you first saw me,

361
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,140
why did you dislike me

362
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,220
and act so picky?

363
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,980
Petty-minded.

364
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,460
Come on, let's look at the lights.

365
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,500
Slow down.

366
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,980
You're back.

367
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,580
Mom, you're here.

368
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,540
I asked my mom to come over.

369
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,340
She'll take care of you during this time.

370
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,580
My son has been working so hard.

371
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
I'm here to help.

372
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,260
Well, sit down.

373
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,340
Dinner's ready.

374
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,260
Thank you, Mom.

375
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,660
So many dishes.

376
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,820
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

377
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,660
You don't need to worry about this.

378
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,540
Come, sit, sit.

379
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,260
Just listen to my arrangements.

380
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,580
This is Chinese sauerkraut stew
with pork knuckle.

381
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,140
- Hot, hot.
- Xiewen loves this dish the most.

382
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,140
Let's go with this then.

383
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,850
Good.

384
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
Mom, you've made so many.

385
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,300
All your favorite dishes.

386
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,980
Huang loves them too.

387
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,580
Tastes great.

388
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,860
- Try it.
- Mom,

389
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,100
when did you arrive?

390
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,020
This morning.

391
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,940
Good, right?

392
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,740
Try some more Chinese sauerkraut.

393
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,380
Mom,

394
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,580
didn't I tell you before?

395
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,980
Don't put so much sauce in the dishes.

396
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,700
I just put a little.

397
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,220
Not even a little.

398
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,540
We're used to eating like this.

399
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,700
Rose isn't used to it.

400
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,420
No, I'm used to it.

401
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,780
I've always cooked this way.

402
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,820
I can't change it all of a sudden.

403
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,900
She just needs to get used to it.

404
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,900
No, Mom.

405
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,740
She's pregnant now.

406
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
You should make
whatever she wants to eat.

407
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,660
Don't have your own ideas.

408
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,900
Got it?

409
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,140
When I was pregnant with you,
I didn't have so many demands.

410
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,460
I just ate whatever was available.

411
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,100
Why is she so delicate?

412
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,180
My goodness.

413
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,500
- Oh!
- Tiny.

414
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,620
How did a cat get in here?

415
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,100
Is it yours?

416
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,420
You can't keep a cat
when you're pregnant.

417
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,060
Cats have fleas
and all sorts of things on them.

418
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,900
Mom, please sit down.

419
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,260
Stop being so jumpy.

420
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,380
Come on, let's eat.

421
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,540
How did garlic get planted here?

422
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
My mom must've thought
those flowers were dried,

423
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,100
so she threw them out.

424
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,540
Those are eternal flowers.

425
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,860
They're supposed to be dried.

426
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
She doesn't understand.

427
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,780
So many things.

428
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,140
A lot of materials

429
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,100
of mine are here.

430
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,420
It's inconvenient
for me to go up and down.

431
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,140
Why don't I live here,

432
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,440
and you and your mom can live upstairs?

433
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,740
That won't work.

434
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,420
We should stay together,

435
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,140
so I can take care of you better
at night.

436
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,140
Whatever you need,

437
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,980
just come over and get it.

438
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,980
You just need to tell her.

439
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,020
No problem.

440
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,780
There's also one from Hebei University.

441
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,620
You can also check it out.

442
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,780
- Hello.
- Mr. Fang, good morning.

443
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,140
This one's good today.

444
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,220
A returned overseas student.

445
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,420
A prestigious school graduate.

446
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,300
He just came back this year.

447
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,580
Hello.

448
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,220
Please sit down.

449
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,180
Have a seat.

450
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,660
Let's start with
an introduction from you.

451
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,220
My name is Zhang Ye.

452
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,340
I'm applying
for a software development position.

453
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,540
I studied at Tongji University
for my undergraduate degree.

454
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,900
Later, I went to the US
for further studies,

455
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,500
earning my master's degree
in computer science.

456
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,940
Is that it?

457
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,500
That's it.

458
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,340
I think he's the most suitable candidate

459
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,300
from this batch.

460
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,420
His salary is also
within our company's budget.

461
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,380
Why can't he join us?

462
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,780
People like him returning from overseas

463
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,060
are all talk.

464
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,700
If he's as good as he says,

465
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,740
why didn't he stay in the US?

466
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,220
We're also professionals ourselves.

467
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,820
We can tell if he's boasting or not.

468
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,100
He passed your test earlier

469
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,660
about C++ and
Java programming languages.

470
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,560
He answered them all.

471
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,860
He even knows some structured query language.

472
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,140
Someone like him would get an offer
from any big company.

473
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,620
Before he figures out
the domestic market,

474
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,860
we should recruit him quickly.

475
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,780
People like him
won't stay long at the company.

476
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,060
Why won't they stay?

477
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,220
Can you have a little faith
in our company?

478
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Yes, we can't offer the salaries
those big companies do,

479
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,420
but our company's atmosphere

480
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,740
and prospects are still very attractive.

481
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,140
I don't care what you say.

482
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,660
I want to hire this person.

483
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,820
No.

484
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,900
I'm also one of the company's leaders.

485
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,700
Why should everything be up to you?

486
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,740
But I'm the largest shareholder
of our company.

487
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,560
Then according to what you're saying,

488
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,980
Huang Yimei also has shares.

489
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,020
Shouldn't we ask for her opinion?

490
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,580
After this fiscal year's settlement,

491
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,780
I'll return the money to her.

492
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,500
All her shares will be transferred
to my name.

493
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,060
Fine.

494
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,380
- Zhu.
- Yimei.

495
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,220
You recovered?

496
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,840
Didn't you apply earlier

497
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,380
for this "Psychiatric Diagnosis"
e-book number?

498
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,220
It hasn't been done yet.

499
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,820
Hurry and push the progress.

500
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,340
Alright.

501
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,060
Yimei,

502
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,980
this computer belongs
to the publishing house.

503
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,980
I know.

504
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,820
I'll bring the rest of the work home.

505
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,580
But Yimei,

506
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,900
didn't they say you resigned?

507
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,790
What are you talking about?

508
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,300
Didn't they say you resigned?

509
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,180
Come in.

510
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,300
Mr. He.

511
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,300
Huang,

512
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,380
why are you here?

513
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,820
Didn't your husband say
you're on bed rest?

514
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,620
Mr. He, I didn't resign.

515
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,860
I haven't even submitted an application.

516
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,660
How could you approve my resignation?

517
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,900
Your husband came to handle it for you,

518
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,880
and he said he had discussed it with you.

519
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,380
He even brought
your credentials with him.

520
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,500
Our department has just been established.

521
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,220
How could I possibly resign?

522
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,940
I don't know about this.

523
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,380
He said your health wasn't good

524
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,900
and the situation was very bad,

525
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,540
so you couldn't continue working.

526
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,100
Have I really lost my job, Mr. He?

527
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
- I really love this job.
- Huang.

528
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,780
Huang, calm down, please.

529
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,180
Your husband

530
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,580
has ended everything here.

531
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,540
You should go home and ask him.

532
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,100
However, resigning now is indeed a pity.

533
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,940
But health comes first.

534
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,460
What if something happens?

535
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,660
We can't afford the responsibility,
can we?

536
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Go home and ask him.

537
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,780
Please come inside.

538
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,860
You even bought flowers.

539
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,620
The flowers are
to welcome their mistress.

540
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,720
Who is more beautiful, the flowers or I?

541
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,900
Of course, you are the most beautiful.

542
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,380
Come here.

543
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,900
Look at our kitchen.

544
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,900
Imagine

545
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,420
this home's master cooking here

546
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,140
for his beloved woman,

547
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,580
and both of them
sitting at this dining table

548
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,060
enjoying their dinner.

549
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
This is their living room.

550
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,540
It's really nice.

551
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,380
Having an architect boyfriend

552
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,300
is quite something.

553
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,780
All the furniture is in place.

554
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,140
What about my bedroom?

555
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
I want to see the bedroom.

556
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,580
Come on.
Aren't these lanterns too plastic?

557
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,660
This is mainly for the festive mood.

558
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,260
For the good atmosphere.

559
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,140
For the good atmosphere.

560
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,780
A two-meter by two-meter bed

561
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,980
looks so comfortable.

562
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,860
It's daytime.

563
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,420
Don't think about unnecessary things.

564
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,820
What's wrong?

565
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,740
What is it?

566
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,580
What?

567
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,940
A bathtub.

568
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,020
Didn't I say I don't want a bathtub?

569
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,460
Didn't we think
the space was too small before?

570
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,180
But I saw one

571
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,660
at the building materials market,

572
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,900
perfect size and 50% off.

573
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,300
So you bought it?

574
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,340
They say girls like to soak in the tub.

575
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,180
Besides, it has a showerhead.

576
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,340
You can shower or soak,

577
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,220
whichever you like.

578
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,060
How great it is.

579
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,540
No.

580
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,180
What's wrong with the bathtub?

581
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,780
(Honey, incoming call)

582
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,740
Hello?

583
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,060
Why did you quit my job?

584
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,140
Did you go to your company?

585
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,740
Didn't I ask you to rest at home?

586
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,140
Why are you running around again?

587
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,420
I told you to help me take a month off.

588
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,020
Who let you quit my job?

589
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,940
Say something.

590
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,420
I'm at the office.

591
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,660
Let's discuss it at home, okay?

592
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,740
You're at work, right?

593
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,700
Your job is important,

594
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,980
and mine isn't?

595
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,340
Come back right now.

596
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,620
Right now.

597
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,900
I really can't go back.

598
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,100
There will be two more interviews later.

599
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,580
Be good.

600
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,060
I won't work overtime today.

601
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,380
I'll come home when it's time.

602
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,540
Is that okay with you?

603
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,260
What's the matter?

604
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,540
Xiewen is at work.

605
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,180
Wait until he comes back.

606
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,020
Then you come back after work.

607
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,980
What's going on here?

608
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,620
I'll pour you some water.

609
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,220
I'll go out for a walk.

610
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,660
Just got back.

611
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,900
And you want to go out again?

612
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,500
Didn't Xiewen ask you to wait at home?

613
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,420
Your son's words are not orders.

614
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,020
This...

615
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,460
So fierce.

616
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,580
Who are you talking to like this?

617
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,100
I'm at an artist's studio.

618
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,940
What's wrong?

619
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,940
Nothing. Get back to work.

620
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,060
Mom, bring a couple more plates.

621
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,460
Coming.

622
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,300
There are more.

623
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,260
This is...

624
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,180
So many dishes must have cost a lot.

625
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,500
These dishes

626
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,700
are all her favorites.

627
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,940
She's not in a good mood today,

628
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,980
so I'm trying to cheer her up.

629
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,580
I'm not in a good mood either,

630
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,780
but I don't see you being filial to me.

631
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,860
What? Jealous of your daughter-in-law?

632
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,220
If you like them,
I'll buy them for you every day.

633
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,900
Nonsense.

634
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,580
You...

635
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,020
Where did you go?

636
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,260
Didn't I ask you to wait for me at home?

637
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,540
I lost my job.

638
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,380
Can't I go out for a walk?

639
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,380
Huang.

640
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,860
My son has been waiting
for you for a long time.

641
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,220
Let's eat first and then talk.

642
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,740
Yeah, let's eat first.

643
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,820
We'll talk after eating.

644
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,940
I'm not hungry. You eat.

645
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,700
After eating, come up and find me.

646
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,500
We need to talk.

647
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,740
Oh, my god.

648
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,260
She has quite a temper.

649
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,500
Difficult to serve.

650
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,020
What should we do?

651
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,700
Shall we eat?

652
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
You should eat a bit.

653
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,420
Look.

654
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,020
These are all dishes you love.

655
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,340
I specially packed them for you.

656
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,860
Don't avoid my question.

657
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,340
At that time,

658
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,340
I was just too afraid

659
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,430
something would happen to you.

660
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,580
The job is mine.

661
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,420
How could you quit my job like that?

662
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,260
You have to discuss it with me, right?

663
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,100
I was just afraid you'd continue

664
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,020
and faint suddenly like last time.

665
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,380
It's so dangerous.

666
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,420
We went to check last time, didn't we?

667
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,980
I stayed in the hospital for two days.

668
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,620
They said
it wasn't pre-eclampsia, right?

669
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,340
It was just fainting
from low blood sugar.

670
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,340
But back then,

671
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,500
no results came out.

672
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,340
I was nervous.

673
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,780
You know.

674
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,380
You've lost your job.

675
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,700
It's too late to say this now.

676
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,180
You'd better rest at home.

677
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,260
You said you wanted to buy a house.

678
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,620
Won't that make things harder for us?

679
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,860
I've lost my job.

680
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,340
Isn't our income even lower now?

681
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,540
Are you being stupid?

682
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,460
Come on.

683
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,420
How am I being stupid?

684
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,420
Let's put it this way.

685
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Your job

686
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,900
was not budgeted.

687
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,140
I never counted

688
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,940
on your small salary

689
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,620
to help with the mortgage.

690
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,540
As long as you and the baby are healthy,

691
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,220
you're already saving us a lot of money.

692
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,420
Moreover, your company

693
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,740
has limited positions.

694
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,340
Do you really think
your leader is so happy

695
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,690
with you asking him for leave every day?

696
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,060
You don't know

697
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,180
how happy he was

698
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,180
that day

699
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,220
when I helped you resign.

700
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,500
Be careful.

701
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,660
You're here.

702
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,220
I thought I forgot to turn off the lights.

703
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,260
I bought a Golden Pathos.

704
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,660
Why was the bathtub removed?

705
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,300
Put it down first.

706
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,820
- Okay.
- Please leave us.

707
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,660
We need to talk.

708
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,100
Sorry.

709
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,180
Please wait at the door.

710
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,100
If you're unhappy with it, just tell me.

711
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,020
Why did you dismantle it
without discussing it?

712
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,620
I said from the beginning
I didn't want a bathtub.

713
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,820
You don't have to be so serious about it.

714
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,780
Even with a 50% discount,
it was still expensive.

715
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,980
I only had this one request,
and you didn't fulfill it.

716
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,420
You decided on your own
to install a bathtub.

717
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,140
So I had someone remove it.

718
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,900
How did I decide on my own?

719
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,380
You entrusted me with the renovation.

720
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,740
Moreover, I sent you the design drawings.

721
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,980
There was a bathtub drawn on them.

722
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,020
Didn't you look closely?

723
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,140
Now you're blaming me.

724
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,980
Yes, it's my fault.

725
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,820
So I had someone remove it myself.

726
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,500
What do you mean?

727
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,390
You think I'm not doing a good job,

728
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,460
so you don't trust
and need me anymore, right?

729
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,900
I spent so much time

730
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,380
decorating your house,

731
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,540
running back and forth

732
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,130
to property management, renovation companies,
and building materials stores.

733
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,020
Even a soap dish was
personally chosen by me.

734
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,420
Now you're dissatisfied

735
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,260
and want it dismantled.

736
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,540
Do you respect my design?

737
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,700
Do you respect my efforts?

738
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,220
No, this is my house.

739
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,900
I made a request you didn't fulfill.

740
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,580
Now I want someone to change it back.

741
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,980
How am I not respecting you?

742
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,780
I'm not stopping you from working.

743
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,180
But your top priority now

744
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,180
is to safely

745
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,500
give birth to the child.

746
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,100
When the child is a little older

747
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,060
and doesn't need your care,

748
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,180
you'll be able to work, right?

749
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,340
So your point is

750
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,620
everything now

751
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,420
should revolve around the child?

752
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,220
What's wrong with what I said?

753
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,220
Why are you arguing
as soon as you're back?

754
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,660
Are you going to eat this meal?

755
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,340
No, Mom.

756
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,260
You eat. Don't mind us.

757
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,100
Can you speak Mandarin in front of me?

758
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,380
I'm talking to my mom.

759
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,700
Your mom speaks Mandarin too.

760
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,940
Huang,

761
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,460
this is my son's home.

762
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
What's wrong with me
speaking in our dialect with my son?

763
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,900
I serve you every day.
Is there a problem?

764
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,100
Mom, could you please
be quiet for a moment?

765
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,900
Why are you arguing with me over nothing?

766
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
I'll leave this mess to you.

767
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,140
Don't cry.

768
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,020
What are you crying for?

769
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,020
Stop crying. Stop crying.

770
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,820
Come on.

771
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,220
What's the big deal

772
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,460
with saying a few words in our dialect?

773
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,060
Why is my mom here?

774
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,100
She came all the way from her hometown

775
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,380
just to take care of you, right?

776
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,780
She doesn't like speaking Mandarin.

777
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,500
Just learn a few words
of our dialect, right?

778
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,340
You can learn French.

779
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,620
Why can't you learn our dialect?

780
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,700
No, I didn't mean that.

781
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,340
That's exactly what you meant.

782
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,220
Stop crying.

783
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,580
Okay, okay.

784
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,580
It's just the hormones affecting you,

785
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,230
causing your emotions to be unstable.

786
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,620
I'll consider it
as the child in your belly

787
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,460
throwing a tantrum at me.

788
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,460
I don't blame you.

789
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,940
But, Rose,

790
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,620
you have to think about the baby, right?

791
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,700
Don't let him hear Mommy

792
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,500
and Daddy arguing all day

793
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,340
before he's even born.

794
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,300
Is that okay?

795
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,700
Yes, you are the boss now.

796
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,060
You're bossing people around.

797
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,620
You're used to giving orders.

798
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,020
You can fire whoever you want.

799
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,380
You don't need to explain to anyone.

800
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,500
What does this have to do with my job?

801
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,580
You're neither my client

802
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,540
nor my employee.

803
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
I'm grateful you offered to help.

804
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,340
I also appreciate your efforts.

805
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,220
I didn't hold you accountable
for the problem.

806
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,700
Now I'll solve the problem myself.

807
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,260
Why do I need to report to you?

808
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,300
Why do I need your consent?

809
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,900
I'd love for you to be my client.

810
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,220
At least that way,
you can consult with me properly,

811
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,700
instead of acting like a hands-off boss.

812
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,940
I did all the work myself.

813
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,300
You're finding faults with me afterward.

814
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,700
Huang Zhenhua, I know
your recent work has been difficult,

815
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,890
but you can't criticize my work this way.

816
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,140
Do you avoid responsibility like this

817
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,700
at work?

818
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,020
Are all your problems at work

819
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,600
really because of the investigation
of your leader?

820
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,900
Do you have no issues of your own?

821
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,740
Have you ever worked in a place like ours?

822
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,740
Have you ever worked with me?

823
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,220
Do you know how I handle every detail

824
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,900
of a project from start to finish?

825
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,540
How can you say
I have problems at work so easily?

826
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,820
The work in our industry is complex.

827
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,740
What do you know?

828
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,500
Don't think being a big shot
in a foreign company

829
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,340
is so great.

830
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,500
If you have the ability, join me then.

831
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,940
I guarantee you won't last three months.

832
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,140
I'm an idiot for helping you
with the decoration,

833
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,220
only to end up with complaints.

834
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,620
It's none of my business after all.

835
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,540
Why should I bother?

836
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,820
Who is it?

837
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,020
Let go of me!

838
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,500
Let go of me!

839

Let go of me!

840
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,100
Let go of me!

841
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,420
