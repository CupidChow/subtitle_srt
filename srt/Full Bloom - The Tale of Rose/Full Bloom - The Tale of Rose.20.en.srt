00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,510
How long have you been back?

41
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,470
A week.

42
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,540
Visited my dad at home,

43
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,900
and came to Shanghai to see you.

44
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,340
You changed your phone number.

45
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,750
Not because of you.

46
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,340
I think

47
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,190
you don't really hate me.

48
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,460
You won't disappear from my life forever.

49
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,230
I don't hate you,

50
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,210
but there's no need to see you.

51
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,790
By the way,

52
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,900
why did you suddenly think
about studying psychology?

53
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,390
Is it because

54
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,030
you were depressed?

55
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,150
Doctors can't cure themselves.

56
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,750
You've heard this phrase, right?

57
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,830
I was joking.

58
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,220
Your career direction

59
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,950
made quite the turn.

60
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,270
I'm having trouble understanding why.

61
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,630
So you think it's related to yourself.

62
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,500
What's wrong?

63
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,660
Zhuang Guodong,

64
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,990
you haven't changed a bit.

65
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,350
You think everything is about you.

66
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,180
You wouldn't know,

67
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,180
because you're someone

68
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,990
who plans every step meticulously.

69
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,030
That's our biggest difference.

70
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,030
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

71
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,060

72
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,060

at headquarters.

73

I'm here this time
to discuss a collaborative project.

74
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,140
Congratulations.

75
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,060

was approved too.

78
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,470
actually,

79
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,940
I still don't understand

80
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,230
why you broke up with me.

81
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,230
Your brother said it was
because I didn't take the final step.

82
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,470
But I really tried.

83
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,510
I just needed more time.

84
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,700
Forget about the past.

85
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,590

88
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,150
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

89
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,780
Alright.

90
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,630
I'll treat you next time.

91
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,730
Looking forward to your next visit.

92
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

93
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,110
I can stay in Shanghai
for a few more days this time.

94
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,300
When can we meet again?

95
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,750
It's not necessary. You're busy.

in algorithm research.

150

Let me ask for you.

Wang,

154
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,940
did anyone find

155
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,980
a flash drive here yesterday?

156
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,340
No.

157
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,270
Alright, get back to work.

158
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,660
Wait a moment.

159
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,590
Okay.

160
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,950
Sorry, sir.

161
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,140
No one found
a flash drive here last night.

162
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,670
Could you please ask again for me?

163
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,340
It's really important to me.

164
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,190
The evening shift staff
won't start until 6 pm.

165
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,950
Could you come back after six?

166
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,870
It'll be too late.

167
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,380
Could you check the
surveillance footage for me?

168
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,950
We can't casually check the surveillance.

169
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,750
You need to report it first
if you want to view it.

170
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,540
Get a certificate from the police station.

This flash drive

174
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,310
is not valuable.

175
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,300
The police probably won't file a report,

176
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,540
but the files inside

177
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
are crucial to me.

178
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,860
Could you please help me?

179
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860

180
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,670

Okay.

190
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,990
7:30 to 8 pm.

191
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,270
Is this the timeframe?

192
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,270
Try this celery.

193
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,510
Rose,

194
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,060
do you remember what you said to me

195
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,950
the night I lost my job?

196
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,710
I told you to start over.

197
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,750
And what else?

198
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,910
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

199
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,700
Just...

200
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,750
Just what you said to me

201
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,580
that night I lost my job.

202
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,830
Do you remember?

203
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,140
In this card,

204
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
there are some savings.

205
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,140
This is a copy

206
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,930
of the company's business license.

207
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,950
Inside are the official seals
for finance and contracts.

208
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,300
This USB contains

209
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,710
all the financial records up to today.

210
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,540
Do you want reimbursements from me?

211
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,990
This is everything I have.

212
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,950
My life and all

213
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,790
are entrusted to you.

214
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,640
The company has already secured

215
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,870
two projects.

216
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,910
They're not huge,

217
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,100
but they can make some money.

218
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,990
Every penny I earn in the future

219
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,950
will also be given to you.

220
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,580
A house, a car, and everything
will be under your name.

221
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,310
Huang Yimei,

222
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,820
marry me.

223
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,540
What day is it?

224
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,100
Today isn't any special day.

225
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,620
Originally, I planned

226
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,270
to wait until the company had developed

227
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,540
with a certain foundation,

228
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,380
so I could be good enough
to propose to you.

229
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,950
But I just can't wait anymore.

230
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,070
Of course,

231
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,340
for someone like me, a poor guy,

232
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,230
to propose to you shamelessly like this,

233
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,620
if you don't want to,

234
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,590
I can understand.

235
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,380
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

236
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,550
For what?

237
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,550
I love you

238
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,670
for your kindness, intelligence,
and loveliness.

239
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,750
Anyway, you're the best woman
in my heart.

240
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,910
No, goddess.

241
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,950
I love you too.

242
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,990
I think

243
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,780
you're talented, responsible,

244
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,590
and ambitious.

245
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,750
They say the only condition for marriage

246
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,780
is to genuinely admire

247
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,100
and love each other.

248
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
So will you agree?

249
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
I love you.

250
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,550
Rose.

251
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,140
There's one thing.

252
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,870
Don't be mad.

253
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,030
I don't know

254
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,190
what style of ring you like,

255
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,670
so I didn't dare to buy one.

256
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,510
Here.

257
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,350
Take this card.

258
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,580
When you find a ring you like,

259
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,870
buy it.

260
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,110
Any amount is fine.

261
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
But

262
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,030
there's only a little over 20,000 yuan

263
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,950
in this card.

264
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,510
Everything's good. Why get married now?

265
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,580
Why do you say that?

266
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,910
That's why they're getting married.

267
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,940
Think about it.

268
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,580
How long have they been together?

269
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,300
Did she call

270
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,750
to inform us

271
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,540
or seek our opinion?

272
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,070
When did your daughter

273
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,300
ever seek anyone's opinion?

274
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,270
She asked us to send
her household registration book.

275
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
She's not returning to Beijing?

276
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,100
Registering at Fang's hometown

277
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,750
is her idea.

278
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,230
They're getting the certificate,

279
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
but we haven't even met the in-laws,

280
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,950
and there's no wedding.

281
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,750
He's taking my daughter away like that.

282
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,230
What kind of rule is this?

283
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,540
She said Fang's business is just starting,

284
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,910
and money should be spent wisely.

285
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,380
So, she's skipping
all those flashy things.

286
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,620
By the way,

287
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,020
red envelopes will be gladly accepted.

288
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,230
There's no limit to the amount.

289
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,820
That's just like what she said.

290
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,750
This girl.

291
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,780
Back then, she jumped around

292
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,230
just to take a graduation photo.

293
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,230
She insisted I buy her a new dress.

294
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,590
Now,

295
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,460
she has no wedding

296
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,300
for such a big event.

297
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,750
As her father,

298
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,140
I won't even see my daughter
in a wedding dress.

299
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,030
Rose is getting the certificate
with Fang.

300
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,510
My mom said to send them
the household registration book.

301
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,870
Should I

302
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,270
deliver it myself?

303
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,230
Such an important document.

304
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,430
If it gets lost in the mail,

305
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,990
our whole family will be in trouble.

306
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,350
Why are you silent?

307
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,950
I'm thinking.

308
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,060
Is Rose suddenly getting married

309
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,860
because it's the right time

310
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,340
or out of impulse?

311
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,140
Impulsive for whom?

312
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,030
Zhuang Guodong has returned to China.

313
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,380
He might have gone to find Rose.

Let's be clear first.

333
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,990
Is this marriage something
you genuinely want?

334
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,790
Of course.

335
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Have you thought about it?

336
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,340
Two people marry out of true love.

337
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,990
They accompany each other
and never leave.

338
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,950
Do you want to perform our ceremony?

339
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,670
Are you sure

340
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,100
you're not doing this
to avoid Zhuang Guodong?

341
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,620
Did you meet him?

342
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,140
He went to see Su.

343
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,270
Su is worried

344
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,060
that this has something to do with him.

345
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,820
If I said I didn't feel anything,

346
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,510
I would be lying.

347
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,300
But he's not good enough to affect me.

348
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,140
This is decided by me and Fang Xiewen.

349
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,140
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

350
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,620
Don't lose it.

351
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,220
Rose.

352
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,790
Do you think

353
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,230
you're happy with Fang Xiewen?

354
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,430
Every day is better than the last.

355
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,860
I believe it will only get better.

356
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,220
Zhou, remember.

357
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,270
This part needs some font adjustment.

358
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,270
- Make it larger.
- Okay.

359
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,030
Hey.

360
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,460
Ms. Su.

361
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,300
Is there something wrong
with the website?

362
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,590
No.

363
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,230
Do you need to adjust the web page?

364
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,190
Not that either. Don't worry.

365
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,580
This time the website is very well done.

366
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,730
The company is quite satisfied too.

367
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,620
That's good to hear.

368
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,190
But for this website upgrade,

369
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,750
since you took the initiative,

370
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,580
we won't be paying any fees.

371
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,910
Yes, you can rest assured about that.

372
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,980
Not a penny.

373
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,030
However, for the website maintenance,

374
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,030
I'd like to entrust it to you.

375
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,750
Annual contract,
including server hosting,

376
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,710
web page updates,
and regular database maintenance.

377
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,550
Would you like to do that?

378
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,700
Of course.

379
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,860
Absolutely.

380
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,430
Great, then please
provide me with a quote.

381
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,900
Sure thing.

382
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,220
I'll get it ready immediately.

383
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,270
Ms. Su,

384
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,110
thank you.

385
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,510
There's one more thing.

386
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,270
About the marriage.

387
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,990
Did you propose it?

388
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,350
Yes.

389
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,070
I proposed

390
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,140
to her.

391
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,780
Why now?

392
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,750
I don't know either.

393
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,700
Maybe

394
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,430
I was afraid of losing her.

395
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,620
I know

396
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,110
there have always been

397
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,510
people better off than me by her side.

398
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,470
I have no money or a house.

399
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,860
I just bought a used car

400
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,470
and it's used by everyone in the company.

401
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,940
I...

402
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,430
I did consider

403
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,820
saving more money

404
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,510
before proposing to her.

405
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,950
But I'm just afraid.

406
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,550
I'm afraid

407
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,670
a long delay may cause trouble.

408
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,780
Ms. Su, please believe me.

409
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,990
I will do my utmost to make her happy.

410
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,940
Really.

411
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,620
I'm not questioning you.

412
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,910
And you don't need to assure me.

413
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,470
I just want to remind you of one thing.

414
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,620
What is it?

415
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,700
Don't feel inferior.

416
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,540
You and I have a business relationship,

417
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,670
but you and Yimei don't.

418
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,140
When two people are together,

419
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,750
if we still talk about qualifications,

420
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,540
compare bids and the like,

421
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,540
that's not love.

422
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,030
You have to believe

423
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,100
since she chose you,

424
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,950
you have no competition.

425
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,750
Inferiority is a double-edged sword.

426
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,510
It can motivate you

427
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,540
but also make you sensitive and fragile.

428
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,510
It will throw you off balance.

429
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,710
Don't let it control you.

430
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,350
I understand.

431
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,700
Ms. Su,

432
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,380
thank you.

433
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,550
Look.

434
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,750
Check the fonts, one for each sheet.

435
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,060
(Married)

436
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,900
Four sheets.

437
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,070
- Is that okay?
- Good. Good.

438
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,860
Where should we put them?

439
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,670
Here, they need to lie flat.

440
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,630
Okay.

441
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,830
That's it then.

442
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,580
Come on, let's spread this out.

443
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,150
Yes.

444
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,310
Why did you buy these?

445
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,260
Shanghai has all of these.

446
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,740
Just give her more money.

447
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,580
Your daughter's learned to be frugal.

448
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,950
If you give her money,
she won't spend it.

449
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,830
Do you think
starting a company is reliable?

450
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,510
How do they calculate seniority?

451
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,740
They're different from us.

452
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,990
We've been in this one job
for our whole lives.

453
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,660
Now, they don't even count seniority.

454
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,870
They value development and prospects.

455
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,660
If they catch a good opportunity,

456
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,950
they'll earn what we've earned
in a lifetime in a few years.

457
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,430
Making money is secondary.

458
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,910
I just hope these two kids

459
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,540
live a stable, healthy life.

460
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,540
Should we put this here?

461
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,390
Put it here.

462
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,350
Put it here, here.

463
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,520
Give it to me.

464
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,380
Okay.

465
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,470
We've got their backs.

466
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,060
Let the kids go and explore.

467
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,220
It's their prime time.

468
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,930
They've never suffered
since they were little.

469
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,660
As long as it's reasonable,

470
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,830
we'll satisfy her.

471
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,620
And even if it's unreasonable.

472
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,660
She keeps knocking me for money.

473
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,540
It's hard for me
to save some pocket money,

474
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,060
but half of it goes to her.

475
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,390
She's savvy.

476
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,830
She won't suffer.

477
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,540
My little cotton jacket
will soon be someone else's.

478
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,180
Her room will still be left to her.

479
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,990
Of course.

480
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,430
What do you mean by "pocket money"?

481
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,220
I have to write a couplet for her.

(Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House)
Hello, sir.

484
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,580
I'm looking for Huang Yimei.

485
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,980
Sure, please come in.

486
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,670
Thank you.

487
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,510
Hello, is Huang Yimei available?

488
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,220
Huang Yimei is on leave.

489
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,270
Is she sick?

490
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,030
No, she's on wedding leave.

491
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,260
(Guest Room)

492
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,060
Welcome.

493
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,420
Hello.

494
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,580
I have a reservation.

495
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,310
Reservation? Let me check your ID.

496
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,940
(Yanping Hotel)

497
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,710
Here.

498
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,310
Alright, that's a 100 yuan deposit.

499
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,990
- Please sign here.
- Okay.

500
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,950
Room 118.

501
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,060
Here's your receipt.

502
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,060
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

503
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,030
Where is Room 118?

504
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,100
It's down that way.

505
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,180
- Alright.
- Welcome.

506
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,830
Thank you.

507
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,900
109.

508
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,500
Hello.

509
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,430
- Further ahead.
- Welcome.

510
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Sorry.

511
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
No problem.

512
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,310
Morning.

513
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,940
Morning.

514
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,620
Don't use their kettle.

515
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,460
It's not hygienic.

516
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,460
Have this instead.

517
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,390
We brought our own water.

518
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,180
It's quite clean.

519
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,940
This isn't good enough.

520
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,020
Sorry about that.

521
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,470
I chose here

522
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,990
because it's closer to my home.

523
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,540
It can't be compared
to hotels in Shanghai.

524
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,220
How can you say "have a meal"?

525
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,180
Have a meal.

526
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,310
Have a meal.

527
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,830
Have a meal.

528
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,790
Yes.

529
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,670
How about "thank you"?

530
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,020
Thank you.

531
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,260
Thank you.

532
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,870
- Yes.
- Thank you.

533
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,830
Thank you.

534
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,780
You don't need to learn these.

535
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,540
Why bother?

536
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,870
I'll translate for you.

537
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,900
What's wrong

538
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,700
with getting the certificate in Beijing?

539
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,470
It will also reassure your parents.

540
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,220
I need to reassure your mom too.

541
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,950
We're almost getting married,

542
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,180
and she hasn't even met me yet.

543
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,540
Everyone,

544
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,060
my son and daughter-in-law
will give you a toast.

545
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,100
- Come on.
- Auntie, auntie, auntie.

546
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,950
Thank you. Thank you.

547
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

548
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,260
Alright, alright.

549
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,580
Okay, thank you.

550
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,390
Sit down, sit down.

551
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,740
Eat more, eat more.

552
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,510
Here, here.

553
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,670
Let me introduce you.

554
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,540
This is my uncle and aunt.

555
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,700
And this is their daughter.

556
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,830
You should call her

557
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,670
"sister".

558
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,630
Sister.

559
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,270
Come, let's have a toast.

560
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,310
Come on, come on.

561
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,670
Thank you. Thank you.

562
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,900
Thank you. Thank you.

563
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,190
Come, come.

564
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,990
Give me the red envelope.

565
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,660
Thank you. Thank you.

566
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,910
Alright, alright.

567
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,390
My son is really something.

568
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,840
He's a graduate student
at Fudan University.

569
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,350
Girls line up to pursue him.

570
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,180
If they're not pretty,
he won't even look.

571
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,220
Come on, let's have a drink together.

572
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,310
Thank you.

573
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,670
Thank you.

574
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,510
Thank you.

575
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,740
This is like watching a Korean drama.

576
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,310
Actually, our dialect

577
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,950
is different from Korean.

578
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,530
The accents are different.

579
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,470
What was your mom saying just now?

580
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,990
She just wanted to ask

581
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,510
if you can eat our food.

582
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,640
She's worried you won't be used to it.

583
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,980
I can.

584
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,940
How do you say "delicious"?

585
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,740
Delicious.

586
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,100
Delicious.

587
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
Delicious.

588
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,790
Come, have some.

589
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,830
Take care. Take care.

590
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,310
Take care.

591
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,710
Thank you.

592
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,660
How was it? Did you eat well?

593
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,500
It was good.

594
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,550
I was worried you might not like it.

595
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,330
No, no need for you to do that.

596
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,510
Don't get your clothes dirty.

597
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,260
- I'll do it myself. I'll do it.
- Alright, alright.

598
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,900
Let me do it. Let me.

599
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,180
It'll be ready by tomorrow morning.

600
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,270
Alright.

601
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,220
(From Zhuang Guodong:
Do not get married.)

602
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,230
Hello?

603
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,260
What do you want?

604
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,640
Are you serious about getting married?

605
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,830
Do you really have no regrets?

606
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,310
I'm on the train. Wait for me.

607
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,630
What's wrong?

608
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,470
Wrong number.

609
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,150
Well...

610
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,510
I ate a bit too much.

611
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,540
I'll take a walk.

612
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,180
You go back and chat with your mom.

613
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,100
Sure, that's fine.

614
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,910
But don't go too far.

615
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,150
I'm afraid you won't find your way back.

616
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,020
