00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,170
My mom went to rehearse again, right?

4
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,900
Their choir

5
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,500
seems pretty serious.

6
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,930
(Chatting with Meifeng Zhuying)
Absolutely.

7
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,770
They even want to compete
in the Beijing competition.

8
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,250
Didn't you go with them?

9
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,810
I went once.

10
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,000
Your mom said I sang a different part

11
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,700
and didn't match anyone else.

12
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,580
So I'm not allowed to go.

13
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,770
(Chatting with Rose)
Don't you get bored staying at home?

14
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,080
Who said that?

15
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,080
I clean the house, buy groceries,

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,790
take care of my plants,

17
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,650
read books, and practice calligraphy.

18
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,040
After dinner, I have to walk
with your mom.

19
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm busy.

20
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,650
By the way, I wanted
to show you my calligraphy.

21
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,630
Dad,

22
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,490
I miss you guys.

23
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,560
Rose.

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,130
Are you feeling unwell?

25
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,760
Tell me if something's wrong.

26
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,720
Don't hide it from us.

27
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,340
Physically I'm fine,

28
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,040
just a bit confused mentally.

29
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,250
How so?

30
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,310
I want to be responsible for the child,

31
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
but

32
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,600
I also want to work.

33
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,620
I also want to get certified.

34
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,530
Am I being too greedy?

35
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,000
Rose,

36
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,760
life is long.

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,250
Finish one thing,

38
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,410
and then start the next.

39
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,530
There's still time.

40
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,440
But my mom

41
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,370
didn't miss any work when she had me.

42
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,160
You don't know.

43
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,250
When she was pregnant with you,

44
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,090
she gave up a chance
to be a visiting scholar.

45
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,250
It was just after she got pregnant.

46
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,760
An American university

47
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,930
invited her for academic exchanges.

48
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,930
It was a rare opportunity.

49
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,320
If she had gone,

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,530
maybe

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,440
you wouldn't be here.

52
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,980
Dad,

53
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,530
do you think being a mother means

54
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,200
having to choose
between work and children?

55
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,810
As long as we live,

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,080
we're constantly making choices.

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,820
A mother's greatness

58
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,940
lies in choosing not for herself,

59
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,930
but for another life.

60
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,130
Compared to most creatures on Earth,

61
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,880
humans are lucky.

62
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,300
If you were just a chimpanzee,

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,060
you'd eat whatever you could find.

64
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,550
But now you can decide

65
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,750
between eating noodles
with soybean paste

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,400
or hotpot.

67
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,000
Making choices

68
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,930
means you still have options.

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
So,

70
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,880
as long as you follow your heart,

71
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,560
there's no wrong choice.

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,640
Should we visit our daughter in Shanghai?

73
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,590
She's been pregnant for so long

74
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,080
and always has excuses for us not to go.

75
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,170
I'm worried.

76
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,200
I feel like
she's hiding something from us.

77
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,700
How about this?

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,790
Let's go next week.

79
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,930
We won't tell her in advance.

80
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,290
I came to apologize.

81
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,400
I brought roast duck.

82
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,630
Depends if it's a whole duck

83
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,080
or half a duck.

84
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,960
A whole set from Duck King,

85
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,440
with pepper-salt duck bones.

86
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,290
Is that sincere enough?

87
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,690
We'll see if the duck bones are crispy.

88
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,640
About the bathtub,

89
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,320
I was wrong.

90
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,590
I should have confirmed
with you beforehand.

91
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,030
I shouldn't have
made the decision myself.

92
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,490
I was wrong too.

93
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,200
I didn't look at the blueprint
you gave me carefully.

94
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,690
Speaking of that bathtub,

95
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,170
when I was a kid, I loved going
to the school's bathhouse.

96
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,860
Back then, families

97
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,810
couldn't afford bathtubs.

98
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,470
Going to the bathhouse meant swimming
and holding my breath.

99
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,420
It was so much fun.

100
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,760
Especially in winter.

101
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,130
Can we not talk about bathing?

102
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,980
Didn't you like going to the bathhouse
as a kid?

103
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,880
Why bring up old wounds?

104
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,870
Sorry.

105
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,830
Sorry.

106
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,430
I talked too much.

107
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,960
Sorry, let's not talk about this.

108
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,190
Tomorrow is the weekend,

109
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,150
and you didn't ask me out.

110
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,520
Someone asked me to go
to the wetland park for fishing.

111
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
A guy.

112
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,200
I didn't ask.

113
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,850
Why in such a hurry
to prove your innocence?

114
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,420
I didn't do anything wrong.

115
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,830
Why would I need to prove anything?

116
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,960
Why are you so nervous?

117
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,150
So, you brought roast duck

118
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,300
to shut me up

119
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,460
and criticize me legitimately?

120
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,250
Can't I defend myself?

121
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,830
Lately,

122
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,950
we've been like

123
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,500
firecrackers.

124
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,600
We explode at the slightest spark.

125
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,910
How about

126
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,150
we take a few days to cool off?

127
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,250
Think about how
to get along in the future.

128
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,520
I'll head back now.

129
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,070
This... I...

130
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,390
(Shanghai Wanjia Forest City, Introduction)
This is in Huangpu District.

131
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,830
Take a look.

132
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,160
This location is great.

133
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,070
But it's a pity

134
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,130
that only one-bedroom units are left.

135
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,950
This one

136
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,230
(Yuhua Qiancheng)
is in Xuhui District.

137
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,850
This three-bedroom unit, see?

138
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,210
Southeast facing,

139
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,280
over 140 square meters,

140
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,090
under 1.3 million.

141
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,350
It's selling very well.

142
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,680
Only three units left.

143
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,730
I plan to pay the deposit this week.

144
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,740
No need to buy such a big one.

145
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,970
The loan pressure will be too much.

146
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,710
With you supporting the family

147
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,300
and paying the mortgage alone,

148
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,130
how long will that take?

149
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,680
I think this two-bedroom

150
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,760
is great.

151
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,280
That's good enough.

152
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,340
Mom,

153
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,420
housing prices have risen rapidly
in the past two years

154
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,970
and will continue to rise.

155
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
I think

156
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,900
we should bite the bullet

157
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
and buy something better.

158
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,820
When the baby is born,

159
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,040
the four of us can live comfortably.

160
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,610
The four of us?

161
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,550
Yes,

162
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,880
my mom

163
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,800
will definitely live with us

164
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,730
to help take care of the baby.

165
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,020
When you were little,

166
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,710
our family of five

167
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,710
with your grandparents

168
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,180
lived in a 20-square-meter house.

169
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,850
We managed just fine,

170
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,950
right?

171
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,730
Now you'll be paying
the mortgage by yourself.

172
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,640
Won't that be too hard?

173
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,510
Listen to me.

174
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,110
This two-bedroom is good enough.

175
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,800
- What do you think, Huang?
- Mom, look.

176
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,110
They're planning to build a subway here.

177
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,950
Look.

178
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,040
Several lines.

179
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,400
It's really great.

180
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,730
Don't turn off the light yet.

181
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,980
Not sleeping?

182
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,740
Well,

183
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,760
will your mom live with us in the future?

184
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,150
Yes,

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,160
she will help take care of the baby.

186
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,400
When the time comes,

187
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,490
I'll sell the house in my hometown

188
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,000
to help pay off our loan early.

189
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,350
Let's not buy such a big house.

190
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,640
How about buying two smaller ones

191
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,830
in the same compound?

192
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,610
You don't get it.

193
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,030
The smaller the unit,

194
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,260
the higher the price per square meter.

195
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,030
Two small units together

196
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,190
cost more than one big three-bedroom.

197
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,250
You don't know the cost of living
as you're not managing it.

198
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,470
I will choose the best

199
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,760
within my budget.

200
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,490
Shanghai is developing so fast.

201
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,640
Believe me.

202
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,940
The housing prices

203
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,570
will soon match international levels.

204
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,760
Buying a big house
in Shanghai's new buildings

205
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,140
is much better than living

206
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,920
in a pigeonhole in Tokyo or Paris.

207
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,190
We are doing fine now.

208
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,570
No need to compare with others.

209
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,570
Who am I comparing with?

210
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,350
I'm not comparing with anyone.

211
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,190
I'm just saying

212
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,150
life in Shanghai isn't worse than abroad

213
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,610
if you have money.

214
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,860
Don't think those who went abroad

215
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,250
are amazing.

216
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,620
Staying in five-star hotels,

217
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,680
eating Western food,
and drinking coffee,

218
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,020
they look glamorous.

219
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,130
But they live

220
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,730
in old, tiny houses

221
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,800
and pay rent their whole lives.

222
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,030
What do you think?

223
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,110
What's wrong?

224
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,950
Don't like hearing this?

225
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,150
I'm tired.

226
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,700
(Beijing and the Olympics)

227
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,830
Uncle Bai.

228
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,400
I was about to go fishing.

229
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,280
Okay, I'll come right away.

230
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,150
Uncle Bai,

231
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,040
what did you need me for?

232
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,330
Huang,

233
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,390
this has nothing

234
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,070
to do with Xiaohe.

235
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,040
Don't be so formal, okay?

236
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,450
Then what is it?

237
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,450
It's like this, Huang.

238
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,880
You work at the Architectural Institute.

239
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,150
I have a request

240
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,210
that might be a bit improper.

241
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,460
Here's the thing.

242
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,920
Our company recently bought some land

243
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,000
to develop a resort hotel.

244
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,990
The project is still
in the planning stage.

245
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,880
So,

246
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,370
I wanted to consult you.

247
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,880
If possible,

248
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,230
we'd like to hire you

249
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,090
for the hotel design.

250
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,070
Are you interested?

251
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,800
Of course, I'm interested.

252
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,880
That's all?

253
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,580
Here.

254
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,250
- I haven't drunk yet.
- Have a sip.

255
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,110
Zhenhua, let's go eat.

256
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,920
I'm not going. Bring me two buns.

257
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,350
You've been cooped up
in this room all morning.

258
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,090
What are you doing, being so secretive?

259
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,580
Nothing.

260
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,190
Just being lazy.

261
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,350
Don't joke. You're never lazy.

262
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,570
Is this another side gig?

263
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,020
Which girlfriend are you helping
with renovations now?

264
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,750
Instead of overestimating my charm,

265
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,280
you should overestimate my skills.

266
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,850
To be honest,

267
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,730
it is a side gig.

268
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,570
Don't go spreading it around.

269
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,950
What's this?

270
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,070
A hotel?

271
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,490
A homestay hotel.

272
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,620
Hello.

273
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,910
Tiny.

274
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,880
Tiny.

275
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,030
You...

276
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,130
Stop eating.

277
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,630
Mom, I told you.

278
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,270
Leftovers are not good for the cat.

279
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,520
It's too salty and greasy.

280
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,250
A stray cat can eat anything.

281
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,280
Why be so picky?

282
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,830
Huang, where are you going?

283
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,730
Xiewen told you to stay home.

284
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,150
Taking out the trash.

285
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,220
Well.

286
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,640
Be careful on the stairs.

287
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,150
- Mom.
- It's fine. Don't worry.

288
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,710
I'll just clean up a bit.

289
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,830
No, no need. Where?

290
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,340
Just sit down.

291
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,770
It's fine. I'll take a look.

292
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,160
Do the flowers need watering?

293
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,370
They're all dry.

294
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,770
What are you writing here?

295
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,200
The words are so small,

296
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,720
like tiny ants.

297
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,550
Hard to read.

298
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,400
You keep writing,

299
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,130
I'll get some water.

300
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,090
I'll wipe here.

301
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,810
There must be dust.

302
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,010
Where are you going?

303
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,400
It's fine. You can wipe.

304
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,430
My son told me

305
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,290
to stay with you.

306
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,480
You keep working.

307
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,260
Alright, you can go now.

308
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,750
I'll talk to Nurse Yan during dinner

309
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,740
about the magic hand issue.

310
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,880
(Distinguished Professor Zhang)
Mao, you've come a long way.

311
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,470
Mao, don't look for Nurse Yan.

312
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,780
Let's discuss it privately.

313
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,860
Okay, I'm not looking for Nurse Yan,

314
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,130
but you have to help me alter my pants.

315
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,540
I can't do that.

316
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,480
You can't? Nurse Yan!

317
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,020
It's just altering pants.

318
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,060
But I have one condition.

319
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,720
Give me a Laoshu's CD.

320
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,060
Did I give you my old military uniform
for nothing?

321
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,330
Look at Hu. He's so generous.

322
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,340
- Gao, look at Hu.
- Thanks.

323
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,090
No need to be so polite. We're comrades.

324
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,580
Huang,

325
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,820
where are you going?

326
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,470
Mom, I'm going out for a walk.

327
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,510
Don't wait for me for lunch.

328
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,480
Wait, I'll go with you.

329
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,990
Well...

330
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,880
She's so fast.

331
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,680
Why hit me?

332
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,370
Hello, what can I get you?

333
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,200
Are these flowers fresh?

334
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,530
I'll take this one.

335
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,130
Okay.

336
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,820
This variety is rare.

337
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,660
Is it?

338
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,770
Add a bunch

339
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,900
of these.

340
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,580
- Okay.
- Is that all?

341
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,720
- Yes.
- Alright.

342
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,790
Mom.

343
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,330
Rose, you're back.

344
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,780
You bought flowers again.

345
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,620
Aren't they pretty?

346
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,160
How much did you spend?

347
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,880
The daisies were ten yuan.

348
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,300
The roses were a bit more expensive

349
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,950
because of their unique color.

350
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,570
My goodness, these flowers.

351
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,620
They grow all over the mountains

352
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,370
back home.

353
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,370
And you're spending money on them here.

354
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
Well...

355
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,330
It's a waste of money.

356
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,620
- Son.
- Mom.

357
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,870
You're back from work.

358
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,710
Yes.

359
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,330
I need to tell you something.

360
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,680
The vegetable prices
went up again today.

361
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,240
Two cucumbers cost four yuan,

362
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,670
and pork is 14 yuan for half a kilo.

363
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,640
With what you make,

364
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,190
you need to buy a house,

365
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,140
support the family,

366
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,640
and raise a child in the future.

367
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,130
Where's the extra money

368
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,290
for these flowers?

369
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,400
Come on.

370
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,610
What's going on?

371
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,390
What happened?

372
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,330
Your wife

373
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,190
bought a bunch of flowers.

374
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,780
The money she spent
could feed us for a week.

375
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,370
How much do you give her monthly?

376
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,360
It's her own money.

377
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,230
That's not right.

378
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,570
She doesn't work, right?

379
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,260
She usually buys

380
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,190
books and flowers,

381
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,670
nothing else.

382
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,680
And she saved that money herself.

383
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,920
You pay the rent, right?

384
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,920
You pay for the food, right?

385
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,710
Her little money means nothing.

386
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,500
When I started my company,

387
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,430
Rose gave me all her savings.

388
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,850
I plan to repay her
with my year-end bonus.

389
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,510
Don't.

390
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,920
Don't be foolish, son.

391
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,850
Don't leave money with a woman.

392
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,060
You need money to support the family

393
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,430
and to buy a house.

394
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,910
You can't save enough

395
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,010
by scrimping alone.

396
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,020
She dresses up and goes out,

397
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,670
shopping and having meals.

398
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,500
She'll waste money.

399
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,370
You can't give it to her.

400
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,260
Alright, alright.

401
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,400
Don't try to control everything.

402
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,330
Mom said you went out today.

403
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,860
Where did you go?

404
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,290
Just wandered around.

405
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,750
Alone?

406
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,810
You were out all day alone?

407
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,230
Yes.

408
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,530
Who sent the flowers?

409
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,430
I bought them myself.

410
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,960
I told you already.

411
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,180
Don't you believe me?

412
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,440
I believe you,

413
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,390
I'm just worried.

414
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,580
What if you feel unwell

415
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,010
while alone outside?

416
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,070
By the way, Rose,

417
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,850
the down payment is due next week.

418
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,770
I'm still a bit short.

419
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,610
I told you not to buy such a big house.

420
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,990
But we paid the deposit.

421
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,810
We can't get it back.

422
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,240
The company has some money,

423
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,580
but it's not the end of the year yet.

424
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,910
I can't just take a bonus

425
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,390
for no reason.

426
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,240
True.

427
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,880
Don't touch the company funds.

428
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,710
Slow down.

429
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,770
I have 20,000 yuan.

430
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,070
Is that enough?

431
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,420
Well...

432
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,470
That's enough.

433
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,920
My mom has a term deposit.

434
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,370
We could lose some interest.

435
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,160
Let me find a job,

436
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,770
even a part-time one.

437
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,710
No need.

438
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,910
The company did well this year.

439
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,390
The year-end bonus will be enough

440
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,050
to cover everything.

441
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,140
(Child Development Psychology)

442
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,460
(Wonderful Vending Machine, Class 2 (3))

443
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,670
Hey, did you draw this?

444
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,510
Yes.

445
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,290
It's really good.

446
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,990
I like it a lot.

447
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,880
How much is it?

448
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,940
This one

449
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,990
is 50 yuan.

450
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,710
Alright.

451
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,130
Sorry, I...

452
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,920
No problem.

453
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,790
I'll come here next time.

454
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,790
Okay.

455
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,530
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

456
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,030
The plan Liu asked for

457
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,030
is over budget.

458
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,770
Don't we have other plans?

459
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,510
Hello?

460
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,710
Hello?

461
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,340
Su.

462
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,530
Go talk to Liu first.

463
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,130
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

464
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't know.

465
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,770
Hearing your voice makes me cry.

466
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,720
Did you argue?

467
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,030
No.

468
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,340
Is it a mother-in-law issue?

469
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,740
TV shows are full of that.

470
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,480
Don't talk about it
if there's nothing new.

471
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,480
Maybe it's pregnancy hormones.

472
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm just bored being alone.

473
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,530
Why aren't you at work?

474
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,480
I quit.

475
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,770
Why?

476
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,330
How's your health?

477
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm fine.

478
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,860
Regular check-ups.

479
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,960
Everything's normal.

480
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,270
Su,

481
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,620
do you have any part-time jobs

482
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,880
for me?

483
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,640
Remote or in Shanghai, anything is fine.

484
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,130
Are you short on money?

485
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,180
We

486
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,090
want to buy a house.

487
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,010
All our money went to the down payment.

488
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,630
Then send me your account number.

489
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,870
I'll transfer the money to you.

490
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,870
Su, I don't want
to borrow money from you.

491
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,910
You're pregnant.

492
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,290
Why rush to work?

493
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,050
I really dislike my current state.

494
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,440
I feel like I'm

495
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,370
a fish in a fish tank.

496
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,100
I used to only ask myself

497
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,880
if I wanted to do something,

498
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,400
never if I could do it.

499
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,240
But now,

500
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,570
I realize that there are many things

501
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,610
you want to do,
but you just can't anymore.

502
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,990
Huang,

503
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,960
such a big project

504
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,910
can't be completed

505
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,610
by just one or two people.

506
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,990
Moreover,

507
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,340
a hotel design of this scale

508
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,610
is certainly a B2B deal,

509
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,580
not something given to individuals.

510
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,610
I understand.

511
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,960
Now,

512
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,770
we have two options.

513
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,020
One, I set up

514
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,620
a new company specifically

515
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,740
for future architectural designs.

516
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,580
You

517
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,290
could come and be in charge.

518
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,570
The salary will definitely
be higher than now.

519
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,100
Or,

520
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,610
you can start your own company,

521
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,880
and I'll invest in you.

522
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,960
I'll also introduce
industry projects to you.

523
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,420
But

524
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,850
either choice

525
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,440
conflicts with your current job.

526
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,010
You need to think it over.

527
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,380
Of course.

528
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,370
You've already helped me a lot.

529
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,610
I can pay you a consulting fee.

530
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,100
I can have someone else

531
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,640
handle the rest.

532
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,270
Uncle Bai,

533
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,150
with your resources and connections,

534
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,640
you must know many

535
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,770
qualified, experienced designers.

536
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,680
I don't understand why you came to me.

537
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,030
What?

538
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,470
Suspecting I'm using public power
for personal gain

539
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,480
and trying to set you up
for my daughter?

540
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,740
No, no, no.

541
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,330
I know my worth.

542
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,510
Huang,

543
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,770
we haven't met many times.

544
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,670
I don't know you well,

545
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,400
but I trust you.

546
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,300
When I visited you at the Institute,

547
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,680
hearing you talk about your work,

548
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,780
I thought you were smart.

549
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,050
And your intelligence

550
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,850
is not aggressive.

551
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,480
You don't make people feel pressured.

552
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,440
This shows

553
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,850
you behave properly

554
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,370
and consider others' feelings.

555
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,910
Xiaohe told me

556
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,130
you're a kind person.

557
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,680
I trust my daughter's judgment.

558
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,050
I like working with people
of good character.

559
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,510
Uncle Bai,

560
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,880
thank you for your compliments.

561
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,290
Also,

562
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,050
I've looked into your current situation.

563
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,570
I know it's easy

564
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,470
to persuade you now.

565
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,130
You've heard about this too.

566
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,920
But Huang,

567
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,290
I started from scratch myself,

568
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,160
so I know how hard it is.

569
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,710
It requires both capability

570
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,290
and good luck.

571
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,830
Uncle Bai,

572
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,230
give me some time

573
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,810
to think it over, okay?

574
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,860
Alright.

575
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,290
Goodbye, Uncle Bai.

576
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,680
You are five years younger than me.

577
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,130
But you look much younger than me.

578
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,670
Not at all.

579
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,060
I've been so tired lately.

580
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,240
My face is full of wrinkles.

581
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,960
Being a teacher is better.

582
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,230
Better than serving others

583
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,430
like us.

584
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,540
Work is work.

585
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,610
There's no difference.

586
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,880
There is a difference.

587
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,340
- Dad, Mom, drink some water.
- Okay, okay.

588
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,640
Thank you, thank you.

589
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,470
Dad, Mom, I just called Rose.

590
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,720
She's at the park and will be back soon.

591
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,800
She didn't go to work?

592
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,610
She didn't feel well.

593
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,450
Once, she fainted on the bus.

594
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,720
Luckily, her colleague
took her to the hospital.

595
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,720
She fainted?

596
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,280
Scared me too.

597
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,320
So,

598
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,140
I quit her job for her.

599
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,410
She was upset with me about it.

600
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,990
I was just worried about her safety,

601
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,360
so in a rush, I...

602
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,890
Health comes first.

603
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,720
She can find another job later.

604
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,020
Fang,

605
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,060
it's alright.

606
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,110
It's alright.

607
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,160
This child

608
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,890
always hides her troubles.

609
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,800
Next time something like this happens,

610
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,760
don't hide it from us.

611
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,760
Don't worry, Dad, Mom.

612
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,270
Since my mom came,

613
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,410
she's been much better.

614
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,640
She goes to the park for fresh air

615
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,410
during the day.

616
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,800
How's her appetite?

617
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,640
Very good.

618
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,100
Three or four dishes for each meal.

619
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,160
She eats them all.

620
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,350
My mom says she cooks

621
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,590
different delicious dishes every day.

622
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,640
The doctor said she's recovering well.

623
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,390
Mrs. Fang,

624
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,280
thank you for your hard work.

625
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,700
You're too kind.

626
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,680
We're family. It's my duty.

627
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,090
Of course, of course.

628
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,220
After eating,

629
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,060
she takes walks

630
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,700
outside every day.

631
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,970
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

632
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,360
Thank you, thank you.

633
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,310
Well,

634
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,140
sitting here is a bit cramped.

635
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,570
- It's fine.
- It's okay.

636
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,010
You brought so much food.

637
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,970
Roast duck.

638
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,260
Didn't know what you liked,

639
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,950
- so we...
- Just bought some.

640
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,580
Love roast duck. I love it.

641
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,020
This is a famous brand.

642
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,610
- A big brand.
- A big brand.

643
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,490
So, what are you going to do, Zhenhua?

644
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,010
I don't know yet.

645
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm still confused.

646
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,390
Working at the Institute

647
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,910
is a stable job.

648
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,990
If you quit,

649
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,930
it feels insecure.

650
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,450
But if I don't quit,

651
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,320
how to grab this golden opportunity?

652
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,510
What if it's just plastic

653
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,050
after you quit?

654
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,310
- Come here.
- Mom.

655
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,150
Come here.

656
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,500
Rose.

657
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,910
What's wrong?

658
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,910
Let me hold you.

659
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,800
Why are you crying?

660
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,510
If your parents see this,

661
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,450
they'll think you were mistreated.

662
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,620
No, no.

663
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,460
Huang.

664
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,970
You have taken such
good care of my daughter.

665
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,800
We all see it.

666
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,570
- This child.
- Come, sit, sit.

667
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,870
- Come on.
- Maybe...

668
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,990
Have a seat. Sit.

669
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,830
After not seeing us for so long,

670
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,870
she's a bit emotional.

671
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,750
Yes, yes.

672
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,750
She's pregnant.

673
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,050
Her hormones are unstable.

674
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,500
Emotions get amplified easily.

675
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,840
Alright, don't cry. Don't cry.

676
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,140
Mrs. Fang, please don't mind.

677
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,870
- I don't mind.
- This child.

678
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,580
We've spoiled her too much.

679
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,830
You're about to be a mom

680
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,680
but still act like a little girl.

681
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,150
Don't cry.

682
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,390
Her temperament

683
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,410
must have given you some trouble.

684
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,720
What are you saying?

685
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,310
We're all family.

686
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,150
What's wrong?

687
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,870
Why the tears?

688
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,970
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

689
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,100
- Alright.
- Xiewen,

690
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,430
come with me.

691
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,280
Don't cry, don't cry.

692
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,630
Well,

693
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,610
how are you?

694
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,830
Come here.

695
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,710
Come on.

696
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,970
What is she doing?

697
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,470
Why is she crying so much,

698
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,930
as if she's been wronged?

699
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,680
It's been long
since she saw her parents.

700
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,110
No.

701
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,270
She must've complained to her parents,

702
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,580
so her mom came to check

703
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,320
if she's been mistreated.

704
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,970
No, don't overthink it.

705
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,930
That's definitely it.

706
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,620
Look, look.

707
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,510
Look at their posture.

708
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,350
Oh, my.

709
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,410
Like two officials.

710
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,160
Keep your voice down.

711
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,130
What about food?

712
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,360
It's so late.

713
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,800
What can I make for so many people?

714
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,580
They came all this way.

715
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,750
We can't eat at home.

716
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,590
Let's eat out.

717
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,860
What?

718
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,100
Oh, my.

719
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,310
Eating out?

720
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,700
I've been here so long,

721
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,660
and you've never said

722
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,830
you'd treat me to a good meal

723
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,320
and never took me out to eat.

724
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,700
Besides,

725
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,140
how much will it cost

726
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,580
for so many people?

727
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,930
And you have to pay.

728
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,500
They're guests.

729
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,890
We can't expect them to pay.

730
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,180
It's not like we eat out every day.

731
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,890
One meal won't make me poor.

732
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,230
Mom,

733
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,760
there's something I need to tell you.

734
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,110
What?

735
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,830
Don't keep speaking dialect
in front of them.

736
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,700
They don't understand.

737
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,790
Oh, so I can't talk now?

738
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,630
I won't talk anymore.

739
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,100
Can I speak like them,

740
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,320
using fancy words all the time?

741
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,020
I can't either.

742
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,390
I don't understand them.

743
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,140
They're university professors.

744
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,320
That's how they talk.

745
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,020
Alright, Mom, change your clothes.

746
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,390
- We'll go out soon.
- Why change clothes?

747
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,280
I only have this one.

748
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,970
How can you have just one set?

749
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,690
Alright, I'll take you
shopping another day.

750
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,240
Always fooling me.

751
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,540
If you skipped one meal,

752
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,930
I could buy several sets of clothes.

753
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,670
Dad, Mom,

754
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,240
this is the bedroom.

755
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,970
It's small

756
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,970
but cozy.

757
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,320
When did your mother-in-law come?

758
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,750
Last month.

759
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,270
How are you getting along?

760
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,950
Is it inconvenient living together?

761
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,870
Come, come.

762
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,990
- Don't stand.
- Sit, sit, sit.

763
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,890
- Sit.
- Sit here.

764
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,090
She's very nice to me.

765
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,280
Every day,

766
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,840
she washes clothes and cooks.

767
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,130
I just go out during the day

768
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,090
and come back
to ready meals in the evening.

769
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,350
He was worried about you,

770
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,090
so he quit your job.

771
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,010
Don't keep blaming him.

772
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,570
His method was wrong,

773
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,610
but his intention was right.

774
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,130
Mom, how long will you stay this time?

775
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,500
What?

776
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,100
We just arrived
and you're rushing us away?

777
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,840
No, I just think

778
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,320
my health is stable now.

779
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,450
I'd like to go back with you
for a few days.

780
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,050
Dad, Mom,

781
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,010
let's eat out tonight.

782
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,500
No need.

783
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,510
I brought a lot of food.

784
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,680
All of them are downstairs.

785
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,060
Fang,

786
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,450
your mom almost brought half a pig.

787
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,020
Too many groceries.

788
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,270
Let's eat at home.

789
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,140
Rose keeps saying
she wants to eat my cooking.

790
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,660
Let's see what's in the fridge.

791
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,800
I'll make a few dishes.

792
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,910
Let your mom take a good rest.

793
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,130
We'll handle dinner.

794
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,620
I'll help you.

795
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,930
- Okay, let's go.
- Alright.

796
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,090
This color is good.

797
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,950
Is it? Try it.

798
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,100
- Come, come.
- You don't need to blanch it.

799
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,540
- If it's fresh, blanch it.
- Careful, it's hot.

800
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,660
Too small, I want a bigger one.

801
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,130
- Okay.
- Otherwise, it'll be bitter.

802
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,680
Careful, it's hot.

803
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,180
- Yes.
- She's teaching you to cook?

804
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,160
She should be teaching her own daughter.

805
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,060
You work so hard all day,

806
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,160
and still have to cook for her?

807
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,410
Mom, stop it.

808
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,970
Do you speak Korean in your hometown?

809
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,660
Yes, it's considered the mother tongue.

810
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,830
That's good.

811
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,160
The child will be bilingual from birth.

812
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,680
By the way, Dad, Mom,

813
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,030
how about

814
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,280
I drive you around tomorrow?

815
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,450
You can see the new house I bought.

816
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,090
It's not built yet,

817
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,530
but you can see the surroundings.

818
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,280
The sales office has models

819
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,570
and sample rooms.

820
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
No need.

821
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,800
The house is for you to live in.

822
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,840
As long as you two like it, it's fine.

823
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,140
We don't need to have a look.

824
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,020
Yes.

825
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,790
It's also close to my company.

826
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,350
You can visit my office.

827
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,190
Next time.

828
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,350
Rose hasn't been home for a year.

829
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,910
We want to stay

830
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,560
and spend time with her.
