3
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,150
Here, here.

4
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,050
One more, one more.

5
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,680
Let's drink without him.

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
Yes.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,710
Sit down.

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,660
I'll talk to Liu about work.

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,690
Come, come, drink.

10
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,430
Come, drink.

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,800
Come on.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
No, I drank all of these.

13
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,660
I'm the best drinker.

14
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,810
Impressive.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,090
I know you're capable.

16
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,940
Go have a drink with the Cyan colleagues

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,980
to thank them on behalf of Goran.

18
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,510
I'll go over then.

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
You all sit here.

22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
You're welcome.

23
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,470
Thanks for your hard work.

24
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,270
Mr. Liu.

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,540
I'm here. I'm here.

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
Come, come, come.

27
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,620
You don't have to drink with me.

28
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,990
Mr. Liu.

29
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,770
How's the food here?

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
- Drink with me.
- Liu, you...

31
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,040
Stop drinking. Do you want some of this?

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Li, don't...

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,340
Who are you calling Li?

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,290
Li.

35
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,310
Comrade Li.

36
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,820
Not the right time to say this.

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,430
Fine, I'll punish myself
with a drink, okay?

38
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,360
Alright, hurry up.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,260
I was wrong. I'll punish myself.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,740
Well done.

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,980
That's enough, enough.

42
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,210
Come, come.

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,380
Let's enjoy tonight. Come, come.

44
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,380
Stop talking.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,260
Li, I haven't...

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
- Haven't in a long time...
- What are you doing?

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,290
Why aren't you back yet?

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,260
Didn't call or text me.

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,370
Are you still in your rebellious phase?

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,340
Did you eat fireworks?

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,810
Why are you yelling?

52
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,070
I'm having dinner with colleagues.

53
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,950
It was a last-minute plan.
I forgot to tell you.

54
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,440
Look at the time.

55
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,670
Where are you eating? I'll pick you up.

56
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,510
No need.

57
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,600
Text me the address.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
One more.

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Fine.

60
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,990
- Why are you drinking alone?
- Liu is here.

61
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,830
How about one more, Liu?

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,070
Come on, come on.

63
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,600
The atmosphere isn't right.

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,670
Let's drink. Come, come.

65
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,080
Come here.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,420
I'm not on a diet.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,930
I'll sit here for a bit.

68
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,140
You guys continue. I'll go first.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,550
Don't go.

70
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,020
Why are you leaving?

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,930
- Why are you leaving?
- Why are you leaving?

72
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,150
- It's not over yet.
- Don't leave.

73
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,490
- Stay a while longer.
- Stay a bit more.

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
How about this?

75
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,350
It's about time.

76
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,280
Let's drink this last round together

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
and leave, okay?

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,920
No, Mr. Zhuang.

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,300
It's still early.

80
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
Alright, then this is the last round.

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,670
You're really a killjoy.

82
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,080
Sit, sit. There's a seat here.

83
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,020
Sit, sit. Sit over there.

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,740
Come, come, come.

85
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,160
(Hongyang Restaurant)

86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,420
Can you stand steadily?

87
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,930
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

88
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,600
- Liu.
- Let's share a taxi.

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,740
I'll leave Leila and Yao to you.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
Luna, are you two going the same way?

91
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,550
Yes, the same way. Don't worry.

92
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,440
Mr. Zhuang,
I suggest we drink another round.

93
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,050
No more. Let's take a rain check.

94
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,650
You three are on the same route.

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,620
Bye-bye.

96
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,140
Bye-bye.

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,810
I drank too fast.

98
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,130
My stomach feels uncomfortable.

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,770
- Where do you live?
- My stomach feels uncomfortable.

100
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,490
Xinyuanli.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,930
I'll call a cab for you.

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,340
Is Ms. Han okay?

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
Rosie.

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,200
Then I'm leaving.

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,420
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

106
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,050
Bye-bye.

107
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
Who is it?

108
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,290
Her boyfriend?

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,850
Is he the one in the blue shirt?

110
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,110
How did you know?

111
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,760
Didn't you say it?

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,770
Surrounded by admirers.

113
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,470
Your colleagues don't know
I'm your brother, right?

114
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,310
No.

115
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,470
That's great.

116
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,390
Get ready to thank me.

117
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,670
Why are you meddling?

118
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,820
Thank you for what?

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,210
You don't understand relationships.

120
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,060
(From Zhuang Guodong:
Are you home yet?)

121
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,700
(From Huang Yimei: Almost.)

122
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,860
(To Huang Yimei:
Is that your boyfriend picking you up?)

123
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,380
(To Huang Yimei:
Okay, be safe. Good night.)

124
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,740
(From Zhuang Guodong:
Okay, be safe. Good night.)

125
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,900
What should I reply?

126
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,990
Don't reply at all.

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,730
Then it will end.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,070
Leave it at that.

129
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,000
Taste but don't indulge.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,580
Stop there. Do you get it?

131
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,200
Stop what?

132
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm going on a business trip
to Shanghai with Tina next week.

133
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,140
- I won't see him.
- That's even better.

134
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,380
Strategic disappearance.

135
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,750
From the way that guy looked at me,

136
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,210
he probably sees me as a rival.

137
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,650
Listen to me.

138
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,210
Whatever he texts, don't reply.

139
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,290
Don't rush to thank me.

140
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,940
You also need to help me.

141
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,660
(School of Chemistry)

142
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,380
Didn't she agree to date you?

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,170
Why still need me as a third wheel?

144
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,600
Didn't Mom say

145
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,150
you are the catalyst?

146
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,410
Forced ripeness
is not as sweet as the natural one.

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
Aren't you afraid I'll rush it too much,

148
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,070
and you'll end up in the bridal chamber?

149
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,240
Wouldn't that be better?

150
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,920
Then we'll move straight

151
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,390
into mutual support and respect.

152
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,960
Mutual support is clingy.

153
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,770
Mutual respect is courteous.

154
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,840
Two different things.

155
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,770
Do you know what mutual support means?

156
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,970
It means...

157
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,770
You must be Xiaohe.

158
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,040
Hello, I'm Huang Yimei.

159
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,290
My sister, Huang Yimei.

160
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Come on, let's go.

162
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,530
This is for you.

163
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,820
No need, thank you.

164
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
It's yours then.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,060
Not bad.

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,500
The air is especially good here, right?

167
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,500
Don't stay at school all the time.

168
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,700
Come out more often.

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
Okay.

170
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,350
Come on.

171
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,430
Have some water.

172
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
Thank you.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,060
Our family comes here often.

174
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,440
There's a hiking trail over there.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
After lunch, we can rest for a bit

176
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,410
and then take a walk.

177
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Alright.

178
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,900
I'm not disturbing your reading, am I?

179
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
No, you're not.

180
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
But won't you find it boring?

181
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,760
Not at all.

182
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,870
Since I can remember,

183
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,850
my parents were like this.

184
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,260
Each sitting
at opposite ends of the sofa,

185
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,550
with a book in hand,

186
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,610
reading leisurely.

187
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,360
This is what I think

188
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,970
a loving couple should be like.

189
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,730
Plain yet romantic.

190
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,090
You really are a great marriage prospect.

191
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,160
Zhenhua,

192
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,660
I got tangled up. Can you help me?

193
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,180
I'll go check on my sister.

194
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,160
Where?

195
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,640
Where did you get tangled?

196
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,110
Why are you sitting so far?

197
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,130
Sit closer.

198
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,340
Yesterday you were all nervous,

199
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,210
but now you know everything.

200
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,940
Just using what I learned.

201
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,110
You didn't reply
to that guy's text, right?

202
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,950
No.

203
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,160
What did you talk about?

204
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,780
She said I'm a great marriage prospect.

205
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,730
Economical and practical guy.

206
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,070
That is a compliment too.

207
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,060
Alright, alright.

208
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,340
Give it to me. Go back.

209
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,240
Play by yourself.

210
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,070
Xiaohe,

211
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,420
what do you think of my brother?

212
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,910
He's great.

213
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,040
Right?

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,520
What's up?

215
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,970
You're not nearsighted, are you?

216
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,130
Why wear glasses then?

217
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,300
How did you know?

218
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,490
My mom is severely nearsighted.

219
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,520
People who wear glasses long-term

220
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,790
tend to have slightly protruding eyes

221
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,250
and squint when looking at things.

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,130
You observe very carefully.

223
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,870
My prescription is actually not high,

224
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,890
just over 100 degrees.

225
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,130
Do glasses give you a sense of security?

226
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,340
Keeping a constant distance from others.

227
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,790
Don't worry.

228
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,680
My brother is really nice

229
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,520
and really gentle.

230
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,890
But you need to close the distance a bit

231
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,580
so he can give you
the security you want.

232
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,850
Did you eat well at lunch?

233
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,310
Yes.

234
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,370
The air here on the mountain
is really good,

235
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,990
with high oxygen content.

236
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,560
Since you're always in the lab,

237
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,040
you need to come out more

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,210
to give your brain some oxygen.

239
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,110
Get closer and hold her hand.

240
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,060
I'm just looking for the right moment.

241
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,460
I can't just go up and grab her hand.

242
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,070
Hurry up.

243
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,160
Hey!

244
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,460
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

245
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,740
- This...
- Where did you twist?

246
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,730
Foot, foot.

247
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,780
Don't move it. Don't move it.

248
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Left foot.

249
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,910
Left foot.

250
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,580
Luckily, we were almost at the bottom.

251
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,230
If we were still at the top,

252
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,690
it'd be like bungee jumping
without a rope.

253
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,920
We're siblings from the same parents,

254
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,390
not fighting for the throne or fortune.

255
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,940
Do you have to go so hard on me?

256
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,970
I'm just worried about you, dear brother.

257
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,610
To hold a hand, I sacrificed a foot,

258
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,350
but I didn't hold her hand after all.

259
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,190
Is this worth it?

260
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,700
I think

261
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,510
whether you hold her hand or not

262
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,110
has nothing to do
with timing or location.

263
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,460
It's all about the person.

264
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,640
Exactly.

265
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,830
With your impatience,

266
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,130
how can I not suffer losses?

267
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,550
Zhenhua,

268
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,660
are you really a couple?

269
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,370
Of course.
She's the one who suggested it.

270
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,490
I feel like
she doesn't like you that much.

271
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,440
She said I'm a great marriage prospect.

272
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,990
She mentioned marriage.

273
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,490
How could she not like me?

274
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
In a relationship,

275
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,800
it should feel like drinking spirits.

276
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,420
But with Xiaohe,

277
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,700
it's like drinking mineral water.

278
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,700
Clean, pure, and healthy.

279
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,160
Nothing more.

280
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,400
Is that right?

281
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,150
Have you ever been in a relationship?

282
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,580
All you do is talk.

283
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,520
Xiaohe,

284
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,700
my brother's leg is not good.

285
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,000
Help him out.

286
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,460
I'll borrow a wheelchair.

287
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,130
What are you laughing at?

288
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
She saw me struggling to walk,

289
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,980
so she wanted to borrow a wheelchair.

290
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,270
She is

291
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,730
full of love for me.

292
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,400
Where's Ms. Jiang?

293
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,010
She has other arrangements.

294
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,830
What are we doing in Shanghai this time?

295
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,670
Seeing art exhibitions.

296
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,420
A company-paid trip.

297
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,400
There will be an avant-garde art exhibit.

298
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
We need to choose
one of these three galleries.

299
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,040
Take a look first.

300
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,880
Got it.

301
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,730
Removing load-bearing walls?

302
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,210
What a joke.

303
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,120
If the building collapses,
who's responsible?

304
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,690
He doesn't understand,
and neither do you?

305
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,700
Can't remove them.

306
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,730
Tell them no. I don't agree.

307
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,790
Tell them I said so.

308
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,670
Alright.

309
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,640
Well...

310
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,420
Who is it?

311
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,480
Coming.

312
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
Who is it?

313
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,660
Why are you here?

314
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,700
I came to see you.

315
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,300
You brought so many things.

316
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,680
Come in and sit down.

317
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
Slow down. It's heavy.

318
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,180
You didn't say you were coming.

319
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,820
I need to tidy up.

320
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,950
It's

321
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,070
too messy.

322
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,970
This vacuum cleaner...

323
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,870
I'm using it as a crutch

324
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,180
since my foot isn't good.

325
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,040
Hold on.

326
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,710
Here.

327
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,580
You really got me a crutch?

328
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,300
Try it. See if it works.

329
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,700
This is perfect.

330
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,920
Sit on the sofa.

331
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,880
Don't stand.

332
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,250
Sit down. Don't use your foot.

333
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
I'm almost better.

334
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,460
I can walk without it.

335
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,950
I'll walk.

336
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,090
See? Is it better now?

337
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
Right?

338
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm almost healed.

339
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,940
- Slow down.
- Look.

340
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
Hey.

341
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,640
Are you okay?

342
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,080
- Still a bit...
- Slow down.

343
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,870
- Are you okay?
- Still a bit weak.

344
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,710
Didn't twist it, right?

345
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,630
No, no, no.

346
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,780
Come, sit over there.

347
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,420
Sorry, I...

348
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,730
- No problem.
- Again...

349
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,610
I didn't know you were coming,

350
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,070
so the place is a bit messy.

351
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,090
Use a cushion.

352
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,640
It's quite comfortable.

353
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,420
Put this under your foot.

354
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,730
Throw that away. It's been a few days.

355
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,840
It's not usually this messy.

356
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,610
I've just been
a bit inconvenient these days.

357
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,300
Usually, I tidy up every day.

358
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,090
Take it slow, come on.

359
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,720
Didn't twist it earlier, right?

360
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
No, no, no.

361
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,880
Alright.

362
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,630
You're suddenly being so nice to me.

363
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,840
Did the doctor tell you

364
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,180
my leg needs to be amputated?

365
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,420
I just came to see you.

366
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,760
Besides,

367
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,970
I'm your girlfriend, right?

368
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,250
This is what a girlfriend should do.

369
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,870
Xiaohe,

370
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,020
thank you for coming to see me.

371
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
No need to thank me.

372
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,740
I'll put the stuff in the fridge for you.

373
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,640
You haven't eaten, right?

374
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,740
What do you want to eat?
I can cook many things.

375
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,850
Stir-fried vegetables with eggs.

376
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,780
How about I cook instead?

377
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,610
Let me do it.

378
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
No need. Let me do it.

379
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,060
Your leg is hurt so badly.

380
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,260
It's only right I take care of you.

381
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,690
Remember to eat more fruits these days.

382
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,840
- Eric.
- Morning.

383
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,850
- Morning, Mr. Zhuang.
- Morning.

384
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,680
- Made a special coffee for you.
- Morning.

385
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,540
- You're here.
- Thanks.

386
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm the last one.

387
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,690
Didn't sleep well?

388
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,170
Got up early.

389
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,590
Where's Huang Yimei?

390
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,130
She's on a business trip.

391
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,260
Why didn't she give a heads-up?

392
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,410
Does it matter whether she comes or not?

393
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,060
Let's start then.

394
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,310
- Alright.
- Sure.

395
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,690
Do you want some water?

396
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,710
No, no.

397
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,550
I'll get you some.

398
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,550
Here.

399
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Thank you.

400
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,740
Want some fruit?

401
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,840
No, don't trouble yourself.

402
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,060
It's fine. Drinking water is good.

403
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
I'll peel a pear for you.

404
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,540
It's good for the lungs.

405
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,200
Wait for me.

406
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,740
You should eat more.

407
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,370
Are you feeling unwell?

408
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,200
Let me help you put your leg down.

409
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,920
No need, it's comfortable propped up.

410
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,710
Putting it down feels empty.

411
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,550
Alright.

412
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,450
Let me know if you need anything.

413
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,060
This painting is scary

414
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,090
and gives a sense of fear.

415
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,590
I like it.

416
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,920
Really?

417
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,410
Any work that stirs emotions
is a good work,

418
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,410
whether it's negative emotions or not.

419
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,740
Don't keep staring at one painting.

420
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,020
Think about your task.

421
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,030
I've observed already.

422
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,590
Lighting, illumination,

423
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,840
and everything.

424
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,920
The avant-garde art exhibition's audience

425
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,950
is relatively young.

426
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,920
This gallery is conveniently located.

427
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,640
Its existing lighting and illumination

428
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,480
suit most exhibits.

429
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,500
There's just one issue.

430
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,470
One of our sculptures for this exhibit

431
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,370
is 3.8 meters long.

432
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,830
I'm not sure if the office building's

433
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,080
freight elevator can fit it.

434
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,540
I plan to ask
the property management later.

435
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,300
Aren't you going to praise me, Su?

436
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
What did you call me?

437
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,550
Su.

438
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,470
Don't call me that at work.

439
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,930
It sounds nice, Su.

440
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,680
Is it here?

441
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,350
The address matches.

442
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,830
What are you doing?

443
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,820
You can't just touch the exhibits.

444
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,590
That.

445
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,750
I think I've seen the recordings

446
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,270
of this symphony orchestra.

447
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,820
A very famous orchestra abroad.

448
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,650
This boss is impressive.

449
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,850
He has such niche things.

450
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,880
Excuse me.

451
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,340
Who played this music?

452
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,740
- I did.
- Sorry.

453
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,090
This is my favorite piece.

454
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,230
This exhibit is hosted

455
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,500
by a foreign friend of mine.

456
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,370
He wants more interaction
with the audience.

457
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,120
So far,

458
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,020
you're the first to use this jukebox.

459
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,410
I'll be sure to tell my friend.

460
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,820
He'll be very happy.

461
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,580
Would you mind

462
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,060
taking a photo here?

463
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,740
I'll send it to my foreign friend.

464
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,980
Not at all.

465
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,930
Hold on.

466
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,260
Here, look at me.

467
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,960
Alright.

468
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,850
Three, two, one.

469
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,710
I'm fine. I don't need anything.

470
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,090
You go ahead with what you're doing.

471
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,850
- Let me help you.
- No need, I can manage here.

472
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,720
Hello.

473
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,920
Mom.

474
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,840
I'm not disabled.

475
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
No need.

476
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
Mom, I still have things to do.

477
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,920
I'll hang up.

478
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,870
It's my mom.

479
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,850
She called,

480
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,400
worried I'd have trouble alone,

481
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,880
and wants me to stay at home

482
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,170
for a few days.

483
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,130
Since it's on the way,

484
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,200
why not come

485
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,450
to our house for a simple meal?

486
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
Perhaps not.

487
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,170
I'm not ready yet.

488
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,400
No need to prepare.

489
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,690
Just play it by ear.

490
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,220
But it's my first time
meeting your parents.

491
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,960
I should bring some gifts.

492
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,690
It's not your first time meeting my dad.

493
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,550
He met you
in the school cafeteria last time

494
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,650
and thought very highly of you.

495
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,400
It's just a simple meal.

496
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,780
No need for them
to ask a lot of questions.

497
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,930
Do you think

498
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,580
our relationship isn't at the stage

499
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,220
where we should meet the parents?

500
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,450
I don't want to bother them
by going back.

501
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,630
It's just...

502
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
I don't want to trouble you so much.

503
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,850
You've been with me for so long.

504
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,500
It's not much trouble.

505
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,590
It's what I should do.

506
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,890
It's not what you should do.

507
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,420
I mean

508
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,340
I'm happy you came to see me,

509
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,220
but I'm not a pet

510
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,700
that needs to be fed
and watered regularly.

511
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,260
I don't need you
to take care of me so much.

512
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,380
Then take good care of yourself.

513
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,900
I'll go back now.

514
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,580
I'll come to visit you another day.

515
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,180
Well,

516
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,300
thanks for the crutch.

517
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,300
I'll head out now.

518
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,060
The layout of this art gallery
is not bad.

519
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,220
But the arrangement of the exhibits

520
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,300
is neither chronological nor by style.

521
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,780
The curatorial thought is a bit messy.

522
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
Su.

523
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,260
- Mr. Zhang.
- Long time no see.

524
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,140
Yes. Let me introduce you.

525
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,940
This is our new curator,

526
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,780
Huang Yimei.

527
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,620
Nice to meet you.

528
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,980
- Welcome, welcome.
- Hello.

529
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,620
Ms. Jiang has called.

530
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,580
I have a rough idea
of your requirements.

531
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,140
Time-wise, there's no problem.

532
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,580
You need to exhibit for two months?

533
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,380
Yes, that's the initial plan.

534
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,380
The details of the contract
still need to be finalized.

535
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,540
Feel free to look around,

536
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,060
I'll grab my laptop and be right back.

537
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,860
- Alright.
- Okay, see you in a bit.

538
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,700
Alright.

539
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,900
Curator?

540
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,300
If you agree to this arrangement,

541
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,540
you can be promoted next month.

542
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,580
Of course, I'll accept it.

543
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,660
Don't agree so quickly.

544
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,500
There's a condition.

545
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,900
You have to quit

546
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,460
the project
of the China-France Culture Fair

547
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,660
and independently manage
this avant-garde art exhibition.

548
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,660
But I've only been in charge
of this project for half a month.

549
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,020
I still have a lot to learn.

550
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,540
We both know why

551
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,060
you joined this project.

552
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,140
Okay.

553
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,700
I understand.

554
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,660
I accept it, and I can do it well.

555
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,700
Don't be so confident.

556
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,940
This time, bringing you out
for the exhibitions

557
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,460
is also to give you

558
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,380
a direct experience.

559
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,580
After watching today's exhibitions,

560
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,380
summarize their content,

561
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,420
form, style,

562
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,180
and your own feelings

563
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,620
for me when we get back.

564
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,660
Su,

565
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,700
did you get this job opportunity

566
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,740
for me with Ms. Jiang?

567
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,460
You want to cultivate Huang Yimei
to be a curator?

568
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,260
What's wrong with that?

569
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,460
There are many senior employees
in the company

570
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,060
who haven't been promoted for years.

571
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,100
Now, Huang Yimei has been here
less than a month,

572
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,740
first transferred to the project group,

573
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,620
and now is to be regularized early.

574
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,780
You must know

575
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,460
there are many people below
saying you're biased.

576
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,980
I don't need to explain

577
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,260
whom I use or don't use.

578
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,460
If anyone has objections,

579
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,220
let them come directly to me.

580
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,340
I never require everyone
to fill in their shortcomings

581
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,580
and become uniform standard employees.

582
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,740
But I hope everyone

583
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,180
can play to their strengths and energy.

584
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,460
Young, beautiful, energetic,

585
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,060
and good at learning and communication.

586
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,660
These are Huang Yimei's advantages.

587
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,140
Everyone has a limited blooming period.

588
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
It would be a waste not to use it.

589
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,340
Okay.

590
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,700
The galleries
have been inspected on-site,

591
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,100
contacts obtained.

592
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,500
You know what to do next, right?

593
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,340
I'll check the specific details tomorrow

594
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,020
and look at other alternative galleries.

595
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,100
Learning fast.

596
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,340
I'm hungry. Let's go
have some pan-fried buns.

597
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,100
My treat, you'll reimburse.

598
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,460
No, I have other things.

599
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,900
A date?

600
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,060
Just kidding.

601
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Don't take it seriously.

602
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,100
I took a leave tomorrow

603
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,140
for some personal business.

604
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,730
See you at the airport
the day after tomorrow.

605
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,220
(Jail, incoming call)

606
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
This quarter's Goran Art Fund

607
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,460
will be used mainly
in the following areas.

608
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,460
First, support for young artists,

609
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,580
including funding for creation

610
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,040
and expenses for
participating in exhibitions.

611
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,620
(From Mom: Have dinner
at Tea Restaurant at 7 pm.)

612
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,740
(Ms. Song's reservation)
Second,

613
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,820
support for various
public cultural activities,

614
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,100
including venue construction,

615
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,620
promotion,

616
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,180
and event organization.

617
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,900
In addition,

618
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,860
there are also art education projects

619
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,260
within our support.

620
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,500
For example...

621
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,540
- You continue.
- Cultural...

622
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,700
For example,

623
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,500
cultural heritage...

624
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,900
- Hello.
- Son,

625
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,140
are you busy?

626
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,660
Shall we have dinner together?

627
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,220
(School of Chemistry)

628
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,180
Why are you here?

629
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,380
I...

630
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,580
- Come in.
- Is it convenient?

631
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,220
Yes. I'm not doing experiments now.

632
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,950
Sit down.

633
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,900
That's okay.

634
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,940
You are...

635
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,460
Are you going to ask me

636
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,860
why I'm dressed like
I'm going to a wedding?

637
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,580
Xiaohe,

638
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,260
last time I invited you home
on the spur of the moment.

639
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,540
I didn't think it through.

640
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,940
You're right.

641
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,420
Meeting the parents is a big deal.

642
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
We need to be prepared.

643
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,140
I came today

644
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,060
to formally invite you

645
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,180
to meet my parents.

646
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,260
Xiaohe,

647
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,940
I...

648
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,140
I truly like you.

649
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,100
I want to continue with you.

650
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,700
If you feel the same,

651
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,780
I'm willing to go to your home

652
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,660
and meet your parents.

653
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,380
I...

654
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
I understand.

655
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,540
I understand.

656
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,340
I know you've tried very hard

657
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,180
but

658
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,140
still can't fall for me.

659
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,700
I understand.

660
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,540
When a girl reaches a certain age,

661
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,660
she may face a lot of external pressure.

662
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,860
But Xiaohe, I want to tell you

663
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,620
you're great, really great.

664
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,100
Never settle or wrong yourself

665
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,460
for anyone.

666
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,620
Don't wrong yourself.

667
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,380
Zhenhua.

668
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,900
This is the first time
you've called me by my name.

669
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,660
- I'm sorry.
- No.

670
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,100
No need to apologize.

671
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,020
There's no right or wrong
in matters of the heart.

672
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,540
No need to apologize.

673
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,940
I didn't mean to deceive you.

674
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,860
Actually, I thought

675
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,180
about being with you

676
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,980
and developing feelings for you.

677
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,820
But...

678
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
But developing feelings

679
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,100
is much harder
than cultivating bacteria in a lab,

680
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,940
right?

681
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,860
Falling in love is much harder
than doing experiments.

682
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,020
Even if an experiment
fails a hundred times,

683
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,900
you can always start over.

684
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,300
When I met you,

685
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
I had just broken up with my boyfriend
three months earlier.

686
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,980
Why did you break up?

687
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,540
We were college classmates.

688
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,980
He's from Anhui

689
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,980
and he's an only child.

690
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,980
His parents have always
been in poor health,

691
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,060
so they kept urging him

692
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,780
to find a stable job back home.

693
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,140
We didn't want to be apart,

694
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,860
so we went for our master's degrees.

695
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,260
But that only bought us
three more years.

696
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,540
After graduating with his master's,

697
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,420
he still went back home

698
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
and became a teacher at a local school.

699
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,220
We were together for over five years.

700
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,700
I never thought about breaking up.

701
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,260
I even considered

702
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,020
moving to his hometown.

703
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,420
But my parents didn't agree.

704
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,460
And honestly, they were right.

705
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,380
Besides studying,

706
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I can't do anything.

707
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,140
Even if I went back with him,

708
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,260
what could I do?

709
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,300
I chose to stay at school
for further studies.

710
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,900
I thought it would only be
a short separation,

711
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,340
and we could still
plan our future together.

712
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,700
But within three months,

713
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,900
he listened to his family

714
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,940
and went on a blind date.

715
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,940
Is that QQ status of yours

716
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,220
meant for him?

717
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,060
Sorry, I...

718
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,220
I shouldn't have told you this.

719
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,620
Why are you saying sorry again?

720
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,940
In fact, I should

721
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,620
thank you for telling me the truth.

722
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,820
Really.

723
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,820
Thank you.

724
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,060
Well, then...

725
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,540
You should get back to work.

726
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,460
Barbecue platter,

727
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,100
(Premium Dishes)
steamed Choy Sum,

728
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,340
beef congee,

729
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,820
pineapple bun,

730
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,060
and char siu puff.

731
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,900
That's enough.

732
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,780
Alright.

733
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,530
Hey, your service isn't good.

734
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,500
She ordered, but did I order?

735
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,700
She finished ordering and you left.

736
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,140
Did you consider
the needs of other customers?

737
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,020
Sorry, sir.

738
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,820
Roast goose.

739
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,180
Sir,

740
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,740
the barbecue platter already

741
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,820
includes roast goose.

742
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,560
Would you like to order
an additional serving?

743
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,540
Can't I order an extra serving?

744
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,060
Of course, you can.

745
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,380
Would you like something, sir?

746
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,220
No, thank you.

747
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,980
Son,

748
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,420
this is your favorite.

749
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,580
Eat more.

750
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,420
- Eat more.
- Thanks, Dad.

751
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,060
A man shouldn't be too thin.

752
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,620
You've been busy lately, haven't you?

753
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,960
It's been a while
since you came back last time.

754
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,460
Not too bad.

755
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,020
When are you going back to France?

756
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,540
What do you mean

757
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,420
by "going back to France"?

758
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,500
Guodong is a native of Beijing.

759
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,660
His home is here.

760
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,940
In Chinese, there's a character for "go".

761
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
You should say "go to France".

762
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,700
Zhuang Taiwen,

763
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,660
I have given you enough face.

764
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,460
Don't push it.

765
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,140
Alright, alright.

766
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,140
You two have been arguing
since I could remember,

767
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,380
quarreling for decades.

768
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,780
Mom,

769
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
you're back this time
for the divorce, right?

770
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,860
Yes.

771
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,940
Letting each other go is a good thing.

772
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,900
A good thing.

773
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,860
I could have done it
without coming back.

774
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,260
I could have hired a lawyer
for the lawsuit.

775
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,740
According to the law,

776
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,580
two years of separation
is enough for a divorce.

777
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,740
The reason I came back from far away

778
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,780
was to show the last bit of respect
for our marriage.

779
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,300
What is respect?

780
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,260
Allowing others

781
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,460
to act and speak
according to their wishes,

782
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,340
without criticism, interference,

783
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,460
or forcing others to accept your views.

784
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,740
That's respect.

785
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,300
Why are you laughing?

786
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,580
I finally remembered

787
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,660
why I couldn't stand you anymore.

788
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,100
(Contacts)
Every time we argued,

789
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,700
(Huang Yimei)
you always nitpicked about words

790
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,940
and made long-winded speeches.

791
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,540
In fact,

792
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,820
you were just trying to cover up your guilt
and incompetence.

793
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,420
Once I saw through that,

794
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,780
I lost even the desire
to argue with you.
