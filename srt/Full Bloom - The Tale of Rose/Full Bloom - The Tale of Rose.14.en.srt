=The Tale of Rose=

2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
How is she?

4
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,140
Finally asked about her.

5
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,980
She's still single.

6
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,390
She resigned from Cyan

7
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,010
and became a psychology graduate
at Fudan University.

8
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,530
She's been studying for a while.

9
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,520
Why did she suddenly want to learn this?

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
She's always interested in everything.

11
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,930
There's nothing
she doesn't want to learn,

12
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,130
and nothing she can't learn well.

13
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,220
But now, she's changed.

14
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,050
She doesn't talk much

15
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,220
and stays quiet.

16
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,540
I know you two separated
because of the long distance,

17
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,180
but since you're both still single,

18
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,710
is there

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,460
any chance?

20
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Of course.

21
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,150
If the distance issue isn't resolved,

22
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,340
nothing else matters.

23
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,620
So, I'm here

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,690
to ask you.

25
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,470
Can you

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
make a compromise?

27
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,350
How?

28
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,320
Come back to Beijing.

29
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,130
Your recent workout is effective,
isn't it?

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,800
- Is it?
- Stop it.

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,540
Then we must go to the north again.

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Is that okay?

33
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,020
What about abroad? What do you think?

34
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,820
Go to the seaside for a while.

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,130
Anything is fine.

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,150
As long as you agree
to return to Beijing,

37
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,930
I'll take care of Rose.

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
Though she didn't tell me directly,

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,350
she's been in contact with Gengsheng.

40
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,250
We can tell she still cares about you.

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,070
What about my work
for these years in France?

42
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,950
With your talent,

43
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,300
you'll surely find
a better job back home.

44
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,480
And doesn't your company

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,880
have a branch in China?

46
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,530
I was transferred from the branch.

47
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,910
You don't know

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,530
how much effort I put in

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,140
to get this position.

50
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,580
Are you willing to give up my sister
for your job?

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Huang,

52
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,050
we're both men.

53
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,370
Put yourself in my shoes.

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,370
If it were you,

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,140
could you do it?

56
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,580
Paris isn't just about work for me.

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,300
It's my career.

58
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,930
Shouldn't a man establish his career
before starting a family?

59
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,230
Look at my dad.

60
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,500
Because of some foolish decisions

61
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,650
he made when he was young,

62
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,650
look where he ended up.

63
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,020
He's just an old loser now.

64
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,340
I can't be like him.

65
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,720
I can't let my mom
look down on me forever.

66
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Guodong,

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,210
I never believed
in the idea of perfect matches

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,180
until you and Rose

69
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,700
appeared in front of me together.

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,970
What a pity.

71
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,340
Is it really impossible?

72
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,310
Can Rose

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,210
come to France?

74
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,720
Remember to open your hands

75
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,700
when you go down later.

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
Don't just use one of your arms.

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,340
How will you swim if you do that?

78
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,000
Open them, right?

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,730
After opening them,
your legs will naturally push.

80
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,790
Understood?

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Try it.

82
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
That's right.

83
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
I understand now.

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm leaving.

85
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,820
Actually, I can understand you.

86
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,730
Look at our names.

87
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,920
Guodong means supporting the nation.

88
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,770
Zhenhua means revitalizing China.

89
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,030
It sounds like we have

90
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,290
important responsibilities.

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,970
But Rose's name is so nice.

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
With endless beauty,

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,610
fragrance naturally comes.

94
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,020
Leaving. Don't bother.

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,730
Almost forgot this.

96
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,210
Did she ask you to give it to me?

97
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,410
You scared me.

98
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,210
Didn't I say not to come pick me up?

99
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,410
You've lost weight.

100
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,650
Is the canteen food bad or something?

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,730
Let's go. Take me to your school.

102
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,790
Sit there.

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Move a bit.

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,060
Still playing this trick?

105
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,200
I used to be the idol type,

106
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,430
but now I'm the capable type.

107
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,060
I'm not fit to play your boyfriend.

108
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,340
Then let them think I'm a gold digger.

109
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,560
After two years,

110
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,030
you're back to eating
in the canteen at school.

111
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,170
You felt like Mom was forcing you
to become a nun back then.

112
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,900
Back then, I didn't even know
what I wanted to study,

113
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,140
let alone how to take the exam.

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,850
Good, good. A variety of skills.

115
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
If you don't have enough money,

116
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
tell me.

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,060
Don't be merciful.

118
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,170
I'll charge you interest
like a regular savings account.

119
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
I have enough savings.

120
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,580
Don't think about charging high interest.

121
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,460
Don't you want to know

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,090
if I met him?

123
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,650
He's gotten thinner.

124
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,700
Much more mature than before.

125
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Got promoted.

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,610
Now he's the manager
of the Marketing Department.

127
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,900
Still single.

128
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
And

129
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,580
he told me...

130
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Don't say it.

131
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,550
I don't want to hear it.

132
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,060
Actually, I've long figured it out.

133
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,380
Figured what out?

134
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,310
When I was with him before,

135
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,260
I always felt

136
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,920
he was selfish, right?

137
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,380
He should have put me first.

138
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,900
But now it seems

139
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,140
he was right.

140
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
People should be selfish

141
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
and put themselves first.

142
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,260
One must love oneself
before loving others, right?

143
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,530
Is that what you really think?

144
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Of course.

145
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,180
Selfishness comes in many forms.

146
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,990
He seeks

147
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,850
the satisfaction of career achievements.

148
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,950
And I seek emotional fulfillment.

149
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,710
The problem between us is

150
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,820
we both prioritize our own needs.

151
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,180
From this perspective,

152
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,970
I'm selfish too.

153
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,700
You didn't fully blame him.

154
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,190
You've matured.

155
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,090
So, don't worry about me.

156
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,730
I really don't want to date now.

157
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,250
I think being single like Su
is quite good.

158
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,250
Quite cool.

159
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,990
Did Su Gengsheng tell you
she doesn't want to date?

160
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,830
She...

161
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,010
I'm just curious. Just asking.

162
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,370
I warn you.

163
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,940
Don't use my friend as a band-aid.

164
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,180
Can I be a band-aid for her?

165
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,580
No, I think she's quite nice.

166
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,850
Quite unique.

167
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,030
Didn't you think
she was too harsh before?

168
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,300
Lacked femininity?

169
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,870
But now I find her quite understanding,

170
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,400
mature, sensible, and straightforward.

171
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,090
She never drags things out.

172
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,890
I'm just objectively evaluating her.

173
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,060
You like her.

174
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,440
Supposedly, she's not my type,

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,730
but I don't know why

176
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,640
I keep

177
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,420
thinking about her.

178
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,230
Can you analyze it
from a professional perspective?

179
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,700
With this feeling of mine,

180
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,010
is it love or curiosity?

181
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,360
You see.

182
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,970
You've liked someone out of reach, right?

183
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,970
You're been admired before, right?

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,250
This is your first encounter

185
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,090
on equal footing, right?

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,780
Then help me.

187
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,280
Stay a couple more days
in Shanghai with me.

188
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,210
I knew you'd come,

189
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,730
so I've got tickets for an art exhibition.

190
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,560
I took two extra days off
to come see you.

191
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,630
After the lunch here,

192
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,300
I'll go to your dorm for my luggage
before I go to the airport.

193
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,700
These tickets are expensive.

194
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,490
Why don't you ask a friend
to go with you?

195
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,760
No friends.

196
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,280
Rose,

197
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,030
being independent is fine,

198
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,540
but don't isolate yourself.

199
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,440
Whether it's friends or a boyfriend,

200
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,250
don't be an insulator, okay?

201
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,060
Hurry up.
You have to go to the airport later.

202
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
Yingzi,

203
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,850
are you free tomorrow?

204
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,750
I want to invite you
to an art exhibition.

205
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,730
Art exhibition?

206
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,400
I won't understand.

207
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,240
It's okay.

208
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,780
We can go to a movie.

209
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,350
Seventy yuan? So expensive.

210
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,420
Did you buy it yourself?

211
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,990
Why don't you ask a classmate
to go with you?

212
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,700
They all already have plans.

213
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,090
I won't go.

214
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,700
It's too expensive.

215
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,490
Liu, are you free?

216
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,210
I'm busy.

217
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,640
I won't go.

218
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,110
Clean up after eating.

219
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,950
Sure.

220
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,790
Huang,

221
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,250
can I have your ticket?

222
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,580
Do you have time?

223
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,970
No, no. This ticket
can't be refunded anyway.

224
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,240
- No, no, no.
- Really, it's fine.

225
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,180
Just take it. You must take it.

226
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,920
No, no.

227
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,460
How can I take advantage of a girl?

228
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
That's not the same.

229
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,590
Thanks.

230
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,970
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

231
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,100
(Dreamy European and American
Fine Art Exhibition)

232
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,400
Rose,

233
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,210
this is your favorite style.

234
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,710
Let's go.

235
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,120
What's wrong?

236
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,660
Why are you standing there? Let's go.

237
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,670
Huang,

238
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,780
sorry for the long wait.

239
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,400
No problem.

240
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
Shall we go in?

241
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,790
Thanks.

242
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,430
What kind of paintings
do you usually like?

243
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,640
Well,

244
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,850
it's my first time at an art exhibition.

245
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,130
Is there anything special
about this painting?

246
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,710
The color scheme is quite simple, right?

247
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,870
But it reminds me

248
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,180
of a painter I particularly like.

249
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,160
Who's that?

250
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,540
George Morandi.

251
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,780
Which country is he from?

252
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,910
Italy.

253
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,700
You're even taking notes.

254
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,680
Since I'm here,

255
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,350
I shouldn't just

256
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,580
skim through.

257
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,700
Might as well enjoy and learn something.

258
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,820
(Fudan University)

259
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,490
Are you from Fudan University?

260
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,310
Yes.

261
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm a postgraduate
in the Computer Science Department.

262
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,490
We've met before

263
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,940
during orientation.

264
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,590
Really?

265
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,940
Sorry, Senior Fang.

266
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,830
I'm from the Psychology Department.

267
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,670
I know.

268
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,790
No,

269
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,420
I mean

270
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,660
I've heard of you.

271
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,490
George Morandi, right?

272
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,480
This artist is the one

273
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,640
we're collaborating with
for this exhibition.

274
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,720
So, I want you to coordinate with him

275
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,390
and send him the space information

276
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,630
for the exhibition,

277
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,920
including details of past exhibitions.

278
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,760
Okay.

279
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,900
(Jail, incoming call)

280
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,510
And also, ask the artist

281
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,420
if there are any special requirements

282
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,950
if they are to be exhibited.

283
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,710
Got it.
I'll organize the information first

284
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,350
and then send it to your email.

285
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,190
Okay, go ahead.

286
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,750
Also, don't forget

287
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,410
to prepare the budget
and send it to me at the end.

288
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,520
Got it.

289
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,590
Go ahead.

290
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,140
(Jail, incoming call)

291
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm at work.

292
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,720
He hit someone and has to compensate.

293
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,660
What does it have to do with me?

294
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,190
Impossible.

295
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,030
That's my dad's property,
and I also have a share.

296
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,130
Why do you have the right to sell it?

297
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,180
Hello, everyone.

298
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,370
Today we'll talk about child psychology.

299
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,280
First...

300
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,390
Su,

301
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,540
how are you?

302
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,650
I'm getting more accustomed
to the new pace of life.

303
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,220
Every morning,
there's an anticipation of the unknown.

304
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,890
I'm always expecting
what I'll learn today,

305
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,610
who I'll meet,

306
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,220
and whether I'll overcome challenges
or be defeated by them.

307
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,450
I made a new friend recently.

308
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,500
He often reminds me of you.

309
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,500
Both of you have a kind

310
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,450
of OCD-like self-discipline
and eagerness to learn.

311
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,140
(Marketing)

312
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,890
You're studying this?

313
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,890
Just taking a look.

314
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,880
With such a great library,

315
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,690
it's a waste not to learn more.

316
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,480
What are you doing?

317
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,260
I found it at the school gate.

318
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,310
You can't feed it like this.

319
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,170
Wait for me.

320
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,990
Most cats

321
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,220
are lactose intolerant.

322
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,650
Drinking pure milk
isn't easy for them to digest.

323
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,450
Adding some rice cereal makes it better.

324
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,020
Are you planning to adopt it?

325
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,820
It's so small,

326
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,920
and with skin problems,
no one will want it.

327
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,450
But my dorm doesn't allow pets.

328
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,850
Then how about this?

329
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,530
I'll help you take care of it
for a few days.

330
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,820
Can you bring it into your dorm?

331
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,920
I don't live in the school dorm.

332
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,610
I've rented a house outside.

333
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,540
Let's give it a name.

334
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,930
It's so small.

335
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,500
It's a tiny cat.

336
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,090
Let's call it Tiny.

337
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,390
Tiny.

338
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,920
Alright, you take care of it.

339
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,220
I'll go talk to the landlord.

340
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,480
Wait for me.

341
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,610
Manager, sorry.

342
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,980
I want to take a leave.

343
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,880
What are you going to do?

344
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Something urgent.

345
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,310
Go ahead.

346
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,590
Thank you.

347
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,410
Hello, I'd like to ask
how much the rent is.

348
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,540
Rent is negotiable,

349
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,080
but I'm allergic to pets' hair.

350
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,220
You can't keep pets.

351
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,230
May I ask how much the rent is?

352
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,890
I can give you a discount.

353
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,150
Three thousand.

354
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,900
(Single room for rent)

355
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,060
Come, young man.

356
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,580
Slow down.

357
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,630
Okay.

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,040
Take a look.

359
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,020
This kitchen is shared.

360
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,360
I have two rooms

361
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
upstairs and downstairs.

362
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,060
You have to rent both.

363
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Hello?

364
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,920
It's so late.

365
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,980
Does the landlord disagree with it?

366
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,220
It's okay. I can find a solution.

367
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,710
Agreed.

368
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,550
No problem.

369
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,710
I'm going to buy something
and come back soon.

370
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,550
Wait for me.

371
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,450
Come see the house.

372
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,890
Do you want me
to show you the upstairs too?

373
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,150
No need, Madam.

374
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,740
Can I just rent one room?

375
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,300
One room?

376
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,060
The stairs are very narrow,

377
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,880
and there's only an iron gate.

378
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,440
If you only rent this room downstairs,

379
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,500
who will rent the upstairs room?

380
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,980
Madam, to be honest,

381
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,580
I can only afford one room.

382
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,610
Madam, please help me.

383
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,930
Well.

384
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,780
I can do that,

385
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,550
but you'll have to pay six months' rent

386
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,390
as a deposit.

387
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,300
Alright, no problem.

388
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
Come.

389
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Here.

390
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,390
Be good.

391
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
This is already troubling you.

392
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,690
How can I let you spend more money?

393
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,360
It's just a little money.

394
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,300
Forget about it.

395
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,550
Please come in.

396
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,440
This room had a leak recently,

397
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,610
so the furniture and other things
were temporarily moved out.

398
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,260
Tiny must be hungry.

399
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,150
Tiny.

400
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,550
Here.

401
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,820
Have some water.

402
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,510
So hungry.

403
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,350
Starving.

404
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,060
You can leave Tiny with me
without worries.

405
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,400
If you miss it,

406
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,690
you can come to see it anytime.

407
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,440
I'm also looking for a house,

408
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,890
so it won't bother you for too long.

409
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,890
You also plan to move out?

410
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,500
I'm working.

411
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,310
If I come back late,
I might disturb my roommates.

412
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm also raising a cat now,

413
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,890
so it's more convenient to rent a house.

414
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,310
Thank you for today, Senior Fang.

415
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,340
My pleasure.

416
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,720
The bus is here.

417
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,090
- I'm leaving now.
- I'll accompany you.

418
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,310
- Bye-bye, thank you.
- Okay, bye-bye.

419
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,150
Slow down.

420
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,340
Young man, why is it you again?

421
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,850
I'm going to sleep.

422
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,500
Sorry, Madam.

423
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,580
I need to rent the room upstairs.

424
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,680
Interesting.

425
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,230
You just asked me

426
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,920
about renting one of them this afternoon.

427
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,220
Now, you want to rent them both?

428
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,060
I'm confused.

429
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,340
That's right. I need to rent both rooms.

430
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,980
You've signed the contract.

431
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,650
I won't refund the deposit.

432
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,920
No problem.

433
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,980
I'll sign another contract with you
for the other room.

434
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,150
So,

435
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,930
the price is the same as for two rooms.

436
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,200
As for the room upstairs,

437
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,610
the rent is 1,500.

438
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,220
You need to pay six month's rent now.

439
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,130
Okay.

440
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,200
Interested in any books? All for sale.

441
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,390
(Sipei Building)
Come and take a look.

442
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
- Big sale!
- Have a look!

443
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
Yes, these are personal items.

444
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,370
90% new. 90% new.

445
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,650
Hey, want to take a look?

446
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,240
Fang, are you really moving out?

447
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,410
Not living in the dorm anymore?

448
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,020
Are you hooked by some vixen?

449
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,540
Are you marrying into her family?

450
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,540
Interested in any books?

451
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,690
Are you also selling this bicycle?

452
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,710
Yes, yes, yes.

453
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,550
How much is it?

454
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,350
One hundred and fifty.

455
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,450
One hundred and fifty.

456
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,850
One hundred and fifty? So expensive.

457
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,780
It's not expensive.

458
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,120
Lower the price a bit, please.

459
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,020
The lowest is 130.

460
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,390
One hundred and thirty.

461
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,440
Can't go lower than that.

462
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,630
Then forget it.

463
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,090
Take another look.

464
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,540
You're even selling the bicycle?

465
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,940
(To Su: I ran 8 kilometers today.)

466
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,800
(Balance reminder, schedule,
meeting arrangements)

467
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
Hello?

468
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,630
What's up?

469
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,300
Where are you?

470
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,080
I went back to my hometown.

471
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
Something's going on at home.

472
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,310
What happened?

473
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,170
Are you okay?

474
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,020
I'll call you back later. Bye.

475
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,410
This morning, they were blocking the door
asking for money.

476
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,500
It took a lot of effort
to persuade them to leave.

477
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,400
How are we going to live

478
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,890
from now on?

479
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,850
With good food and drink,

480
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,890
I see him living quite well.

481
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
If I don't eat well,

482
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,170
how am I supposed to work
to pay them back?

483
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,500
Easy for you to say.

484
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
It was you who hit someone.

485
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,920
If you can't afford the money,
then pay with your life.

486
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,980
How do you talk to your dad?

487
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,340
He's not my dad.

488
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,270
If you don't give us the money,

489
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,640
there are only two ways.

490
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,090
Either sell this house

491
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,310
or let your brother

492
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,740
drop out and work to earn money.

493
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,580
Jie, come here.

494
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,300
Tell your sister
whether you want to go to school.

495
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,670
By the way,

496
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,170
have you found a house?

497
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,410
I've checked some.

498
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,540
Either too far or too expensive.

499
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,610
There's another room upstairs.

500
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,510
Seems it's for rent too.

501
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,450
It's currently vacant.

502
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,080
But someone came to see it
a couple of days ago,

503
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,980
It might be rented soon.

504
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,450
Can I take a look?

505
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,850
Sure, let me ask the landlord.

506
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,500
Okay, thank you.

507
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,540
Pretty good.

508
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,690
This is great.

509
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,270
I'll get this one.

510
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,820
Can you ask the landlord
how much it costs?

511
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,340
I think it's about 800 per month.

512
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,980
Eight hundred? That's so cheap.

513
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,610
Nice, nice.

514
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,650
Business is doing pretty well here.

515
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,170
The scenery is nice too.

516
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,220
(To Su: Though you said no need,
I think you need someone by your side.)

517
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,860
(Anyway, I'm here in Room 303,
Kelai Hotel.)

518
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,820
I won't let you drop out.

519
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,490
Do you remember that thing?

520
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,370
You know what I'm talking about?

521
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Yes.

522
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,700
After all, he's your biological dad.

523
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,570
No, not because of that.

524
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,660
I was little back then.

525
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,890
I don't remember it clearly.

526
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,660
I didn't understand when I was young.

527
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,370
I was very scared.

528
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,370
Now, I just want to sue him,

529
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,570
but I have no evidence.

530
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,740
The ventilation duct on the bathroom door

531
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,410
was never removed.

532
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,350
I know you were hiding under it.

533
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,260
I saw you.

534
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,370
When he got angry, he hit Mom

535
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,110
and me.

536
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,820
He'd beat us severely.

537
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,530
I was afraid.

538
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,270
I'll buy the house.

539
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,270
After it's mine,

540
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,450
don't think about it.

541
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,260
What about the money?

542
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,300
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

543
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,160
Okay, okay.

544
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,740
You and Jie can stay in the house.

545
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,570
If he dares to cause trouble again...

546
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,750
But

547
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,660
I can't afford your rent.

548
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,050
You're making big money in Beijing.

549
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,700
Don't kick your mom out

550
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,660
just for a little money.

551
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,110
Well,

552
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,730
will you still give me money

553
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,660
every month from now on?

554
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,740
(Call ended)

555
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,300
Hello? Hello?

556
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,490
Rest assured. I'll be back on time.

557
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,040
It won't affect my work.

558
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,780
I have my laptop with me.

559
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,550
You...

560
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,700
Listen.

561
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,930
Isn't that the sound of a blueprint?

562
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,620
It won't affect my work.

563
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,160
Well, I have something to do here.

564
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,000
Talk to you later.

565
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,670
Mr. Wang.

566
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,780
Okay, bye.

567
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,970
Why are you here?

568
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,100
I should say "Why am I here", right?

569
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,700
No, I wasn't planning anything.

570
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,670
I've thought about it.

571
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,510
Never expected it to happen so suddenly.

572
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,000
Su...

573
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,960
Gengsheng,

574
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,140
where did you go?

575
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,450
Shouldn't you take me
to eat something delicious?

576
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,890
I'm going back to Beijing.

577
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,960
I'm at the train station.

578
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,450
You're going back to Beijing?

579
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,530
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?

580
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,620
Let's just forget about last night.

581
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,140
You don't need to take responsibility.

582
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,820
What if I want you
to take responsibility?

583
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,020
(Tsinghua Road)

584
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,240
You must carefully
read the lease agreement.

585
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,640
Don't get screwed.

586
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,480
And

587
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,310
the south is too humid.
Must ventilate more,

588
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,310
otherwise, everything gets moldy.

589
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,780
It's inconvenient to live alone outside.

590
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,660
You have to be careful about everything.

591
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,300
I know. Don't worry about it.

592
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,660
What about the cat
when you're home for the holidays?

593
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,640
Right, I haven't thought about that yet.

594
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,930
You won't spend Chinese New Year
in Shanghai, right?

595
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,370
Let's talk about it later.

596
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,010
Mom, I have something to do. Bye.

597
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,740
What's going on?

598
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,340
Is she moving out to live on her own?

599
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,780
She found a cat.

600
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,630
Here.

601
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,670
Senior,

602
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,930
are you here looking for me?

603
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,550
No.

604
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,890
I'm waiting for someone.

605
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,530
Who?

606
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,180
Here you are. Just these two?

607
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,680
- Give them to me. Let me help you.
- No need.

608
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,640
I can manage myself.

609
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,700
Let me take this for you.

610
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,110
Okay.

611
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,440
Let's go.

612
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,890
He likes her.

613
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,970
Right.

614
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,240
- The wind is strong.
- Look.

615
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,100
Thank you.

616
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,630
My pleasure.

617
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,630
Thank you.

618
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,630
No problem.

619
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,100
This is the last one.

620
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,790
I'll help you.

621
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,680
No, it's fine. I can handle it.

622
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,620
No, it's fine.

623
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,150
Senior Fang,

624
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,600
you've helped me take care of the cat,

625
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,180
rented the house, and moved.

626
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,670
This is for you.

627
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,190
I hope you like it.

628
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,190
Thank you.
