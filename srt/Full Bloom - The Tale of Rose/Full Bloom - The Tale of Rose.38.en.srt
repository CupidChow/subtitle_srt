00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 38=

3
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,140
Awake?

4
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,700
You're back.

5
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,000
Why aren't you sleeping in the room?

6
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,020
Is your back still hurting?

7
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,860
Much better.

8
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,250
Then sit down. Don't stand.

9
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,540
I've been running around all day

10
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,700
but haven't recovered the money.

11
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,060
My lips are going to wear out.

12
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,180
I'll go again tomorrow.

13
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,740
I'll stay at their company
if they don't pay me.

14
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,180
I'll rotate between the chairman's office
and the finance department.

15
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,100
Hungry?

16
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,420
I won't eat at this hour.

17
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,460
I need to lose weight.

18
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,700
You've slimmed down.

19
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,740
How about a barbecue?

20
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,020
Is this entrapment?

21
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,980
I can eat today,

22
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,460
but tomorrow, I can't gain weight

23
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,300
on the scale.

24
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,460
- I can't laugh.
- Don't laugh.

25
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Ouch!

26
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,420
Can I really eat?

27
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,420
I'll get you some kidney

28
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,340
to replenish you.

29
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,140
Get a few more.

30
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,540
With a beauty,

31
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,300
wine, food,

32
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,420
and a massage chair,

33
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,780
life is too comfortable.

34
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,180
Can't resist temptation.

35
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,340
You've been running around all day.

36
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,540
Feeding you a bit is okay.

37
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm going

38
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,700
to treat Uncle Bai to dinner

39
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,460
and get him
to introduce some business to me.

40
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,860
Though retired,

41
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,140
his connections in the industry

42
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,980
are wide.

43
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,740
Why are you staring at me?

44
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,580
You were as down
as a crashed computer before.

45
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,420
If I knew yelling at you would reboot you,

46
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,580
I would've done it earlier.

47
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,740
I'll declare in advance.

48
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,180
Occasional yelling is okay,

49
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,980
but too much will break me.

50
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,860
Eat more.

51
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,180
Next time you fall, no one will save you.

52
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,980
Are you plotting something?

53
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,980
Are you?

54
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,140
You want me to lose weight

55
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,900
while feeding me kidneys.

56
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,420
Smells good.

57
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,540
I'll have Han Ying

58
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,580
deal with Peng Songtao directly.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I don't want

60
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
to see him either.

61
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,420
No need.

62
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,060
You've known each other

63
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,020
since childhood.

64
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,380
You should meet

65
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,660
for business.

66
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,340
Aren't you jealous?

67
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,900
Why should I be jealous?

68
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,540
Why shouldn't you be jealous?

69
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm out dealing with people

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,540
and you don't worry?

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,940
I'm not pretty enough or in good shape?

72
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,140
Pretty, in shape.

73
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,660
Then you don't like me anymore.

74
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
You don't care for me.

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,300
I like you. I do.

76
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,980
Then why aren't you jealous?

77
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,220
I am jealous.

78
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,900
Are you genuinely jealous?

79
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,620
Of course, I've been wanting to say it.

80
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,860
From now on, you can't meet him.

81
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,940
Say it louder.

82
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,820
From now on...

83
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,780
Louder.

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,380
Mom.

85
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,340
You've woken your child.

86
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,460
What are you doing?

87
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,660
Son,

88
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,420
why are you up?

89
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,940
Come here.

90
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,020
What's up?

91
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,460
Why didn't you call me for the barbecue?

92
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,980
You were asleep, weren't you?

93
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,100
Besides,

94
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,100
this isn't good for your health.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,500
Why are you eating?

96
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,340
We...

97
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,460
We're...

98
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,900
- This...
- I want some too.

99
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,580
This has chili, Sweetie.

100
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,460
I can handle it.

101
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,900
Okay. But don't cry later.

102
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,740
Can you handle it?

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,180
Help yourself. I'll sort him out.

104
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,980
Come over.
I'll take you to get some water.

105
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,460
Dad,

106
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,900
this house is so big.

107
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,660
Grandma always says
my models take up space.

108
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,100
I'll come here to make them.

109
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,820
I want a big one.

110
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,660
Great.

111
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,860
Taichu, look over there.

112
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,660
Downstairs is a garden. Amazing.

113
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,940
Come on. Over here.

114
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,580
I'll show you your room. Come.

115
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,780
Taichu, check it out. Do you like it?

116
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,020
So many toys.

117
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,660
Did you buy these for me?

118
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,340
Or did Ms. Xiaoyu buy them?

119
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,300
I bought them for you.

120
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,420
There are some here too.

121
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,740
See what else you want.

122
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,460
Ms. Xiaoyu's coming tomorrow.

123
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,780
She'll take you shopping.

124
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,740
Does Ms. Xiaoyu live with us?

125
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,460
Of course not.

126
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,460
She's here on business,

127
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,900
staying in a hotel.

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,340
Ms. Xiaoyu likes you so much.

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,020
Why don't you let her be your girlfriend?

130
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,540
She works at my company.

131
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,740
So what?

132
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
Taichu,

133
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,740
let me tell you.

134
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,780
Be careful with what you say,

135
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,220
especially in front of your mom, okay?

136
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,500
Okay.

137
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,900
Dad, can I invite
my classmates over to play?

138
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,940
Of course.

139
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,020
This is your home.

140
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
Taichu, what do you want to drink?

141
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,380
Anything.

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,900
Are you tired from school?

143
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,780
A little.

144
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,540
Shall I transfer you

145
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
to an international school?

146
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
Is that okay?

147
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
Why?

148
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Then you would have less pressure.

149
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,220
No, thanks.

150
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,700
Why not?

151
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,980
Do you know

152
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,620
many want to go to international schools?

153
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,180
My school is fine.

154
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,060
All my friends are there.

155
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,300
I'd miss them.

156
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,180
You'll make new friends

157
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,940
in a new place.

158
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,180
International schools are much easier.

159
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,660
You'll have more time
for Grandma and Grandpa.

160
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,220
It's okay to have more pressure
when studying.

161
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,980
Once I've learned, I'll have freedom.

162
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,660
I can study wherever

163
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,820
and whatever I want.

164
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,180
Like Mom.

165
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,660
Like your mom?

166
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,820
Your mom alternates

167
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,420
between art and psychology.

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,140
The things she's learned

169
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,820
aren't related to each other.

170
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,980
Like your mom?

171
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,420
My mom even learned to fly a plane.

172
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
So cool.

173
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,300
Your mom learned to fly a plane?

174
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,900
Wait a moment.

175
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
Let me see.

176
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,740
This one.

177
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,900
Look, how cool my mom is.

178
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,140
Is this the person

179
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,900
your mom's instructor?

180
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,980
Mr. He. Handsome, right?

181
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,460
Really awesome. Score!

182
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,540
Thank you, Mr. He.

183
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Mom, you're amazing.

184
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,020
Has he been teaching your mom

185
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,100
to fly all along?

186
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,940
Yeah.

187
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Mr. He says

188
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,140
my mom is his smartest student.

189
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,340
Mr. He,

190
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,540
I owe you a meal, right?

191
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,980
What would you like to eat?

192
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,900
I...

193
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,900
You're not picky. Right.

194
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,180
How about burgers?

195
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Okay. Your call.

196
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,620
You're right.

197
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,020
It's too early to pigeonhole myself

198
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,700
for life.

199
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
So, I want to try again

200
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,780
and apply for a CAAC license.

201
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,180
You'll pay for it?

202
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,540
How much is the tuition?

203
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,260
600,000.

204
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,180
That's a lot.

205
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,300
I've already saved up some.

206
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,020
Besides the job here,

207
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,540
I've earned money
designing the simulator cabin

208
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,420
and doing some mechanical translation.

209
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,180
I'll have enough in a few more months.

210
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,220
When are you leaving?

211
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
I...

212
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,020
I haven't contacted the flight school yet.

213
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,300
Why?

214
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,660
They have my academic records.

215
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,060
I was grounded once.

216
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,020
I don't know if they'll accept me.

217
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,700
If they don't accept you,

218
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,780
your life won't change much.

219
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,940
But

220
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,940
if they do,

221
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,340
everything will head

222
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,300
in the direction you want.

223
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,780
What's the harm in asking?

224
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,260
Thanks.

225
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,140
My motorcycle's gone for maintenance.

226
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,620
I'll take a cab home today.

227
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,460
Let me call one for you.

228
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,940
No need. I've already called.

229
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,060
Help me with this.

230
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
Rose.

231
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,140
Why are you here?

232
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,380
Our daughter was worried
and asked me to pick you up.

233
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,260
Why are you so late today?

234
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,300
Mr. He, thank you.

235
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,020
- See you next week.
- See you next week.

236
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,580
Bye-bye.

237
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,420
Are you tired?

238
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,620
No.

239
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,820
(Massage. Back. Intensity.)

240
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,660
Hungry?

241
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,620
Want to eat something before going back?

242
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,260
No.

243
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,420
We just ate.

244
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,700
With that instructor?

245
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,540
Is this a class

246
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,020
or a date?

247
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,380
No wonder you're out so late.

248
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,180
Does he like you?

249
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,300
How old is this guy?

250
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,020
Is the age difference between you two

251
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,020
a bit large?

252
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,540
He's quite cute.

253
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,900
Handsome,

254
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,940
determined, serious.

255
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,500
That's like you.

256
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,180
But he hasn't confessed to me.

257
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,780
So I don't know what he thinks.

258
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,780
If you're interested,

259
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
ask him yourself.

260
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,420
And if...

261
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,900
I mean if

262
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,060
he really confesses to you,

263
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,060
will you date him?

264
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,540
Does appreciating him
mean I should date him?

265
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,780
But I didn't say I wouldn't.

266
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,020
Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.

267
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,180
Who to date. When to date.

268
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,660
None of it's certain.

269
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,300
You guys call this...

270
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,260
What's it called?

271
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,380
Random event.

272
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,860
Yeah.

273
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,500
Love is a random event.

274
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,460
When I really meet someone

275
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,620
I want to date,

276
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,540
how old they are,

277
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,180
what job they do,

278
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
where they're from,

279
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,060
their height or weight.

280
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,660
None of it matters.

281
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,420
Of course.

282
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,900
It doesn't matter to you either.

283
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,700
Right.

284
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
It doesn't matter to me.

285
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
I don't care.

286
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,900
But it matters to Taichu.

287
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,940
Isn't it

288
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,380
for our daughter's sake?

289
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,900
Fang,

290
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,820
I've known you for so many years.

291
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,940
I know what you're thinking at once.

292
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,100
(Rose: Mr. He, if you have time,)

293
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,940
(I'd like to schedule
two more lessons next week.)

294
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,020
(He Xi: Sure.)

295
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,220
(He Xi: Sure.)

296
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,180
(He Xi: I'm sorry.)

297
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,020
(Rose: ?)

298
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,460
(He Xi: Your husband came to pick you up
and I made him wait.)

299
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,860
(He's my ex-husband.)

300
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,620
Her ex-husband.

301
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,980
I won't go to the Cyan
and Chongqing Manman

302
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,140
Charity Art Exhibition.

303
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,820
You'll go with Su.

304
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,980
She already told me.

305
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,260
And the year-end art festivals

306
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,220
in Hong Kong (China) and Venice.

307
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,380
Watch it closely.

308
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,340
You'll sign the contracts.

309
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,820
Arrange the time yourself.

310
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,460
Don't bother me if there's nothing.

311
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,620
Want to get rid of work?

312
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,420
I'll go to South America

313
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,940
with my boyfriend for three months
for inspiration.

314
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Inspiration or honeymoon?

315
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,780
Look.

316
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,900
I've already returned the ring to him.

317
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,580
I won't get married for now.

318
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
About how far we'll go,

319
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,180
we'll see when we get back.

320
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,180
I might come back with him.

321
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,260
I might come back alone.

322
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
I might come back with someone else.

323
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,420
Anyway,

324
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,740
I'm giving myself
a three-month love leave.

325
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,180
You'll handle work matters.

326
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,420
Don't bother me if there's nothing.

327
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,900
Do you have a boss like this?

328
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,820
When you're in love,

329
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,740
I'll give you leave too.

330
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Hello, Taichu.

331
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,140
Mom,

332
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,060
I'm with Dad. Hurry over.

333
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,900
What's up?

334
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,860
Just come.

335
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,020
My mom's cooking is so bad.

336
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,100
Are you really letting her cook?

337
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,460
Everything's prepared for her.

338
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,660
All she has to do is light the fire.

339
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,740
How can it still be bad?

340
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
I don't know about that.

341
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,180
Dad,

342
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,340
do you know
why someone so smart as my mom

343
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,620
doesn't improve in cooking?

344
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,660
Why?

345
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,660
She says people must allow themselves
to have flaws.

346
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,660
If you nitpick everything,

347
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,100
that'll be too hard on yourself.

348
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,860
Makes sense.

349
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,460
Besides cooking badly,

350
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,300
your mom

351
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,620
doesn't really have any flaws.

352
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,820
What's up with you?

353
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,220
You're keeping a secret.

354
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,900
Sorry, sorry.

355
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,460
I forgot today's your birthday.

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,740
Being here is enough.

357
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,380
Mom,

358
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,260
why not make Dad
a bowl of birthday noodles?

359
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,900
Consider it making it up for him.

360
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,060
So much food.

361
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,660
Dad said back when you were chasing him,

362
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,140
it was with these birthday noodles.

363
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,500
I chased you?

364
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,180
I didn't tell you to say that.

365
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,700
Do you want

366
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,500
to make the noodles with me for Dad?

367
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
You can wash the vegetables.

368
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,940
You're just trying to get me to help you.

369
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll wash the vegetables then.

370
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
Alright.

371
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,100
Put it in.

372
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,140
Okay.

373
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,420
Careful with your hands.

374
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,500
Get a bowl.

375
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,620
Dad, try it.

376
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,660
Okay, I'll try it.

377
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,460
Looks good.

378
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,500
Try it.

381
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,620
Try it.

382
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,260
This is the best birthday noodles

383
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,900
I've ever had in my life.

384
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Our daughter made it. I just helped her.

385
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,980
Here. Happy birthday.

386
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,740
- Come on.
- Happy birthday.

387
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,140
Thank you.

388
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,180
Come on. Cheers.

389

- She's asleep?
- Yes.

391
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,860
Have a seat. Have some tea.

392
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Okay.

393
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,140
Honestly,

394
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,380
it's been many years
since I celebrated my birthday.

395
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,820
Kids all like birthdays

396
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,220
because they get to
eat cake and get gifts.

397
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,300
Thank you.

398
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,380
But for adults,

399
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,700
it's just another bowl
of bad birthday noodles.

400
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,380
I forgot the salt again?

401
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,500
Just like that bowl

402
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,580
back then.

403
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,100
And yet you still ate it all.

404
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,260
Rose,

405
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,180
you're really good at everything,

406
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,220
but you didn't inherit
your mom's cooking skills.

407
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,180
Speaking of which,

408
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,660
why is cooking
harder than flying a plane?

409
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,900
Even if you cook badly,

410
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,540
I still want to eat it.

411
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,060
The other day, you said

412
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,060
love

413
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,420
is a random event.

414
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,100
I agree,

415
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,700
but have you ever thought

416
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,660
about why neither of us

417
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,380
could meet someone

418
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,980
over the years?

419
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,180
It just happened.

420
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,380
The idea

421
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,220
of starting over

422
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,260
to get to know someone

423
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,180
and being together

424
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,660
in all aspects

425
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,900
takes time and effort

426
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,380
to adapt.

427
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,900
It just feels too exhausting.

428
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,300
So you want to get back with me,

429
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,460
skipping all that?

430
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,780
Fang.

431
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,500
I tried moving on too,

432
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,140
but I always have you in my heart.

433
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,460
No one else can get in.

434
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,180
Like today,

435
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,260
the three of us

436
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,740
enjoy dinner together.

437
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,860
This is what I want my home to feel like.

438
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,500
Rose,

439
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,140
it's been so many years.

440
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,100
I want you to tell me the truth.

441
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,900
Were we together

442
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,180
because you were at a low point in life?

443
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,660
You didn't actively choose me.

444
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,660
You just accepted me passively.

445
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,740
Actually, I've always known.

446
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,620
I just never dared to ask.

447
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,660
- At that time, did you...
- Fang,

448
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,660
I loved you.

449
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,860
So can you...

450
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,900
No.

451
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,580
I don't understand your computer terms.

452
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,660
Don't know if
that description is accurate.

453
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,940
My love

454
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,460
is single-threaded.

455
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,820
I can only love one person at a time.

456
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,860
Once I love someone else,

457
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,020
it means

458
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,220
our thread has ended.

459
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,340
You humanities students

460
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,900
are always misusing technical terms.

461
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,740
Single-thread, multi-thread,

Isn't that so?

466

I think you haven't made up your mind

472
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,420
not because of financial pressure,

473
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,660
or objections from your parents,

474
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,860

to face that failed past.

No one pays attention to failure,

478
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,740
as failure is much more common

479
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,900
than success.

480
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,900
Since everyone experiences failure,

00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,900
what's so scary about it?

482
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,660
You just need to admit it, accept it,

483
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,180
and then let it go.

484
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,260

your parents, right?

585
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,700
Slow down a bit.

586
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,700
Dad, Mom, chase me.

587
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,620
- I'll play over there for a while.
- Chasing you.

588
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,590
Slow down a bit.

589
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,060
How can we catch up with you
if you ride a bike?

590
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,700
Don't ride over there.
Come home, Pudding.

591
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,420
Let me play a little longer, Dad, Mom.

592
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,300
Let me play a little longer.

593
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Then just a little while.

594
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,460
Ten minutes, okay?

595
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,140
It's a deal.

596
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,660
Got it.

597
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,780
Don't ride over there.

598
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
Come back. Come back.

599
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,340
This kid.

600
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,500
We're two straight-A students.

601
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,300
If we make him study, his stomach hurts.

602
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,700
If we make him read, he gets sleepy.

603
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,140
That's because of you indulging him.

604
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,180
Who bought the iPad and the game console?

605
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,180
Okay, I indulged him.

606
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,020
But this problem needs to be solved,

607
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,860
or it'll be too late for school.

608
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,820
I'll try to reason with him,

609
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,740
but if I can't get through,

610
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,180
don't stop me from getting physical.

611
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,980
Only spank him on the bottom.

612
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,420
Deal.

613
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,060
Time flies.

614
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,340
I still feel like a kid.

615
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,660
Now I'm a dad.

616
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,220
Isn't it amazing?

617
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,700
- Back when I bought dumbbells online,
- Slow down.

618
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,500
how did I randomly click on you?

619
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,860
If it weren't for those dumbbells,

620
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,340
would we not be here today?

621
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,420
Do you want to hear the truth?

622
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,380
What truth?

623
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,140
Many people

624
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,380
pass each other by often.

625
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,540
Because they don't know each other,

626
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,820
they've never noticed.

627
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,380
But once they do know each other,

628
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,700
they all say, "What a coincidence!"

629
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,940
Actually it's not.

630
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,300
They might live in the same neighborhood,

631
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,060
work in the same building,

632
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,180
with the same working hours,

633
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,100
so it's only normal

634
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
for them to meet.

635
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,980
Are you saying

636
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,220
it's not a coincidence that we met?

637
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I mean

638
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,500
some coincidences aren't coincidental.

639
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,820
Many things can be traced,

640
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,340
or they're destined.

641
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,380
Once you discover this coincidence,

642
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,260
it means the life paths
of these two people

643
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
have intersected.

644
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,740
So can I understand it like this?

645
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,740
You're my sister's boss.

646
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,900
That's traceable.

647
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,060
Dumbbell smashing my foot is destiny,

648
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,100
and destiny made me

649
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,900
marry such an excellent wife as you

650
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,460
and have a big son, right?

651
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,940
Son, come here. Have some water.

652
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,780
In the blink of an eye,
our son is so big.

653
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,820
What? He's only five.

654
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,260
In the blink of an eye, he'll be 15.

655
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,540
In another blink, he'll be 25.

656
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,500
Who knows which girl he'll run off with?

657
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,700
Don't say it in front of him.

658
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,940
Whether it's in front of him or not,
he'll do it.

659
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,940
Is that right?

660
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,260
By then, it'll just be the two of us,

661
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,460
old and depending on each other.

662
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,780
Let me tell you.

663
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,980
You must exercise regularly.

664
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,860
Stay healthy.

665
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,980
If I end up bedridden,

666
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,300
you'll have to remove my tubes.

667
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,540
How dare you?

668
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,660
If you dare die before me,

669
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,260
I'll make sure to kill you right now.

670
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,780
Why compete for this?

671
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Pudding, come here.

672
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,500
Let's discuss something.

673
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,420
Starting tomorrow,

674
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,820
you'll ride your little bicycle

675
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,580
and take your dad to run, okay?

676
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,460
Five kilometers every day.

677
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,180
- Deal.
- Deal.

678
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,900
What...

679
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,500
What deal?

680
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,860
You'll have to run too.

681
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,900
You can't ride your bike.

682
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,460
I'll ride my bike.

683
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,020
Please gather your belongings.

684
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,500
Thank you.

685
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,660
Thank me?

686
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,500
Why?

687
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,660
You earned your tuition.

688
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,260
You applied to school yourself.

689
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,380
I just encouraged you a bit.

690
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,460
No need to thank me.

691
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,300
This is for you.

692
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,860
You made it?

693
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,100
Yes.

694
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,100
I made it from old airplane parts.

695
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,260
I heard your ex-husband call you Rose.

696
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,980
I guessed it must be your nickname.

697
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,180
Steel rose.

698
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,620
I like it.

699
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,180
Thank you.

700
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,700
One year from now,

701
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,020
I'll come back.

702
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,260
When I come back,

703
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,380
I want to be with you...

704
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,220
No.

705
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,140
Don't promise the future.

706
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,140
A lot will happen this year.

707
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,180
We'll meet many people.

708
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,740
Who knows

709
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,220
what the future holds?

710
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,700
That uncertainty

711
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,340
is the most exciting part of the future,

712
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,580
right?

713
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,580
I recently read a book

714
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,500
that resonated with me.

715
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,460
You have

716
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,820
your place to fly to.

717
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,660
So do I.

718
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,260
Goodbye.

719

720
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,420
Goodbye.

Huang Yimei II.

722
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,140
