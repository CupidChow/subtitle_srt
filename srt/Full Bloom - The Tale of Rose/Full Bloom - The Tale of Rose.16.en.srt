00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,140
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,350
My treat today.

4
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,840
It's not for celebration.

5
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,870
I guess it won't be good.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
The last time
my words were pretty hurtful.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,200
I apologize to you.

8
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,630
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Well, you...

10
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,680
Your words were understandable.

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm sure that incident

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,560
won't pass for a while.

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,750
I'm not good at interacting

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
with men.

15
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,590
I thought

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,360
I could give up on that.

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,750
It's fine to be alone.

18
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,400
But I don't know when

19
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,280
I started to relax around you.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm harmless

21
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,910
and honest.

22
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,150
So?

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
As you said,

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,000
a trial period
without a guaranteed outcome.

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,280
That's right.

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,750
If you don't try it, how will you know
if it's right or wrong?

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,630
Then let me make it clear first.

28
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,630
I won't sacrifice myself,

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,030
nor will I accommodate you.

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
If I feel uncomfortable,

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,590
we'll stop.

32
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
Of course,

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,430
you're not obliged to endure me.

34
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,710
You have the right to end it too.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,430
Should we sign a contract first?

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,030
You're confessing like
this is a negotiation.

37
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,840
Who said I was confessing to you?

38
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,190
I'm giving you a chance to confess again.

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,000
Do I have to do it again?

40
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,120
- You can choose not to.
- Here it comes.

41
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,920
I didn't bring any flowers.

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,240
This will do.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,680
Su.

44
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,750
From 15 days, 9 hours,
and 17 minutes ago to now,

45
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,520
it's been four more days,

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,430
give or take a few minutes.

47
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,270
I didn't

48
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,870
calculate it earlier.

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,000
After thinking for so many days,

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,960
I still like you.

51
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,750
Give me a chance

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,080
to apply to be your boyfriend

53
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,830
with a trial period of six months.

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
It's quite heavy. Put it down first.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,680

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,400

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
I've already ordered.

when it comes to relationships,

187
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,840
he's always been a bit careless,

188
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
not very considerate.

189
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,200
As his father,

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,960
I apologize on his behalf.

191
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,110
No need.

192
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,750
Huang,

193
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,000
I can tell

194
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,150
he really misses you.

195
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,750
Hello?

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,240
How about this?

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
Could you two talk?

198
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Communicate, maybe?

199
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
No need.

200
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,470
Alright.

201
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,550
It's about you two,

202
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,120
so it's up to you guys.

The school hasn't started yet, right?

228
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,840
Why come to work early?

229
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,240
Gotta make money.

Came back early?

234
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,670
Tiny is doing well.

235
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
It eats a lot.

236
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,480
I'm afraid I'll overfeed it.

237
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,750
I'll pick it up later.

238
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,200
Mom made ribs.

239
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,120
I brought you a portion too.

240
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,360
I'm practically drooling.

241
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440

What's wrong?

244
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,720
What time did you get home last night?

245
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,600
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,630
I already told you in advance.

247
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,030
You got back at two.

248
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,870
So what?

249
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
Is it my first time getting back at two?

250
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,030
How long have we just been married?

251
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
And you come back this late?

252
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,120
Have you never come back at two?

253
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
Have you never come back at two?

254
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,390
You were not like this
when we were dating.

255
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,720
Now you come home drunk every day.

256
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,200
You're picking a fight, aren't you?

257
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,200
Who doesn't know
I went drinking yesterday?

258
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,150
Didn't I tell you?

259
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,000
Who knows which vixen

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,360
you met yesterday?

261
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
Who did I meet?

262
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,630
I went for a few drinks with friends.
So what?

263
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,390
If you can't stand it,

264
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,670
let's get a divorce.

265
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,960
Are you crazy?

266
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
Ma'am,

267
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,350
are you okay?

268
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
Don't get involved.

269
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,530
Haven't you seen a fight before?

270
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,720
Sorry, sir.

271
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,550
Our restaurant is closing soon.

272
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,120
If you're finished eating,

273
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
let me help you with the bill.

274
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,320
Did I say I'm finished?

275
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
What's the problem?

276
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
Are you trying to throw us out?

277
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,240
Two more bottles of beer.

278
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,720
Did I tell you to move?

279
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,750
Sir.

280
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,440
Why are you crying?

281
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,670
I'll kill you if you cry again.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,270
Ma'am, do you need me
to call the police for you?

283
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
What's it to you if I beat my wife?

284
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,670
Go ahead and call.

285
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,200
Go ahead and call.

286
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,240
Come on. Go ahead.

287
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,080
Sir,

288
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
sorry about that.

289
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,320
She just started here

290
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
and doesn't know the rules. Sorry.

291
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,960
When guests dine in our restaurant,

292
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
we have a duty to protect their safety.

293
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,120
I'm dining in this dump,

294
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,120
and I have to listen to you lecture me?

295
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,200
- Sir.
- Who do you think you are?

296
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,270
Sorry, sir.

297
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,110
Come on.

298
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,550
- Sorry, sir.
- Who do you think you are?

299
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,840
- Sir.
- Calm down, sir.

300
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,510
Sir, here's the thing.

301
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,440
We're about to close here.

302
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,910
If you have any issues,

303
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,440
could you please settle them outside?

304
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,480
How do we settle it?

305
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,320
Is this okay?

306
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,790
I'll give you a 50% discount
for this meal.

307
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,550
Do I look like someone
who can't afford it?

308
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,550
No, sir, you misunderstand me.

309
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,480
That's not what I meant.

310
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,630
What I meant was...

311
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,960
Shut up.

312
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,230
Let her talk.

313
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,200
You.

314
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,040
Speak.

315
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,750
Didn't you just talk a lot?

316
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,240
Let her apologize to me.

317
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,010
What was her attitude just now?

318
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,280
I apologize.

319
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,840
I apologize on her behalf. I'm sorry.

320
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,600
Who do you think you are?

321
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,840
I want her

322
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,150
to apologize.

323
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,840
- Forget it, let's go.
- You shut up.

324
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,710
- Watch out.
- Ma'am.

325
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,200
- Are you okay?
- Get lost.

326
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,720
Fang! Fang! Fang!

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,550
Forget it, Fang. Come out, Sun!

328
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,920
Come out! Someone's hurt!

329
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,550
Stop hitting him, Fang!

330
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,110
Fang! Fang! Stop it!

331
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,590
Alright, alright, alright.

332
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,270
- Stop it.
- Fang, stop it.

333
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,590
I'll kill you.

334
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,110
Stop it!

335
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,440
- Don't get physical.
- I'll hit you!

336
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,280
Stop it.

337
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,310
Stop it. Stop it.

338
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,190
Go away.

339
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,110
Stop it.

340
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,150
Stop it.

341
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,950
Fang, Fang!

342
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,600
- Stop it.
- I'm telling you.

343
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
If you continue, I'll call the police.

344
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,040
Calm down.

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,520
Calm down.

346
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,310
Feeling dizzy?

347
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,190
Nauseous?

348
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
No.

349
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,510
You should be especially careful tonight.

350
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,240
Someone must stay by his side.

351
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,920
If there's any headache,
nausea, or dizziness,

352
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,230
seek medical attention promptly.

353
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
Okay.

354
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,270
Better get him a CT scan

355
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,960
- to check thoroughly.
- Okay, okay.

356
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,270
The wound isn't deep,

357
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,440
but it's close to the eye.

358
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,920
Better not to use anesthesia.

359
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,000
Endure it a bit, young man.

360
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,190
Alright.

361
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,350
Girlfriend, hold his hand.

362
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,670
It's okay.

363
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,180
(Wound Care Room)

364
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
The surveillance proves

365
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,760
both had the intent
to engage in conflict.

366
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,670
The man pushed the girl first,

367
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,560
so he started hitting him.

368
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,440
Yes, that's how it happened.

369
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,750
Looks like this injury

370
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,240
is quite serious.

371
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,430
Here's the thing.

372
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,310
Let me explain to both of you.

373
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,000
After questioning the couple,

374
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,160
they insist you started the fight.

375
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,350
From the surveillance footage,

376
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,590
your punch was quite severe indeed.

377
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,310
However, there was a reason for it.

378
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,960
He pushed your girlfriend first, right?

379
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,440
We're colleagues,

380
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,000
not boyfriend and girlfriend.

381
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,070
You're too young to play the hero.

382
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,720
How old are you?

383
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,560
Your temper is so fierce.

384
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,720
Is it worth

385
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,440
fighting over such a trivial matter?

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You broke so many things

387
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,950
and hurt yourself.

388
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,000
What if that handsome face

389
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,110
gets disfigured?

390
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll pay for all the losses in the store.

391
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,790
It's not just the store's loss,

392
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,530
but also the other party's
medical expenses.

393
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,000
At the same time, I want to remind you

394
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,640
that they still have

395
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,310
the right to sue you civilly.

396
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,110
- You need to be clear on this.
- No, they...

397
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,950
Understood.

398
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,920
Officer,

399
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,550
I accept any punishment.

400
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,310
It's all my fault.

401
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,030
Good attitude.

402
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
That's all we need for now.

403
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
- Is the statement finished?
- Yes.

404
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,080
Review it.

405
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,200
If everything's correct,

406
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
sign it.

407
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,240
Also, keep your phone on.

408
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,440
We may need to contact you again.

409
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Okay.

410
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,760
Are you okay?

411
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,320
I'm fine.

412
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,240
Take it slow.

413
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
Thank you.

414
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,440
Is your back okay?

415
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,790
It's fine. I'm already better.

416
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,440
I'll manage myself.

417
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
I'm fine.

418
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,880
It's getting late.

419
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,440
You should go rest.

420
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,240
The doctor said you need someone
by your side tonight.

421
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,230
Where's your electric heater?

422
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,960
- I don't have one.
- Really?

423
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,960
It's so cold.

424
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,240
How do you keep warm?

425
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,560
I...

426
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,590
I just shiver.

427
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,160
This is the only electric heater.

428
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,960
You can use it with Tiny.

429
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,110
- Let me do it.
- It's okay.

430
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,950
Sit there.

431
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,480
Rest early.

432
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,510
I'll go out first.

433
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,950
I'm coming in.

434
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,630
Thank you.

435
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,910
Huang,

436
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,240
why don't you come up and sit here?

437
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,110
There's an electric blanket. It's warm.

438
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,490
Please don't misunderstand me.

439
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
I mean no harm.

440
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm just worried you might be cold.

441
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,000
How do you have my photo?

442
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,550
Well...

443
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,880
You took me to an art exhibition once.

444
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,640
I found it quite interesting.

445
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,750
During the Spring Festival,
I had nothing to do,

446
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,510
so I found a few free exhibitions
to visit.

447
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,680
In a small gallery

448
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,550
that I forgot

449
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,240
its name,

450
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,510
while I was browsing,

451
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,790
I saw your photo on the wall,

452
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,030
along with many others.

453
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,040
Just like this one.

454
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
What a coincidence.

455
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,790
In an old Western-style building?

456
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,640
Yes, in an old Western-style building.

457
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,680
So you asked them for it?

458
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,670
Actually,

459
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,520
I stole it.

460
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,000
I was afraid they might violate
your portrait rights.

461
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,240
I intended to give it to you,

462
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,440
but I haven't got the chance.

463
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,640
I thought I might forget,

464
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,830
so I kept it here.

465
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,790
Today seems like a good day
to return it to you.

466
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,950
I'll give it to you.

467
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
I...

468
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,070
Cover up a bit more.

469
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,400
This room is really cold.

470
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,510
Still dizzy?

471
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,520
Not too much,

472
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,830
just a bit lightheaded,

473
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,720
like after drinking.

474
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,760
Huang,

475
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,520
I'm sorry.

476
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,110
Today,

477
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,200
you got expelled because of me.

478
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,640
It's my fault.

479
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,400
And that girl didn't appreciate it,

480
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,270
claiming we started the fight.

481
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,270
I thought that guy was tough,

482
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,310
trying to intimidate us.

483
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
Turns out he couldn't handle it.

484
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,920
Didn't expect you could fight so well.

485
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,000
I used to fight boys when I was little.

486
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,240
They liked putting caterpillars

487
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,590
in my pencil case and my schoolbag.

488
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,830
No wonder you're so brave.

489
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,920
You've started it since childhood.

490
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,400
If we'd met back then,

491
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
maybe

492
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,890
you wouldn't have been able to beat me.

493
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,270
I couldn't bear to hit you though.

494
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,920
Honestly,

495
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,520
I wanted to learn martial arts

496
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,270
when I was little.

497
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,830
Do you want to be a hero?

498
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,750
When I was a kid, I did dream of it

499
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,000
to act on injustice.

500
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,680
But as I grew up, I got more cowardly.

501
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,160
I ended up just running away

502
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,960
from injustice.

503
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
Anyway,

504
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,550
thank you

505
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,480

(Chatting with Endless Life)
Happy birthday, Sister-in-law.

567
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,320
Who's your sister-in-law?

568
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,000
I really didn't expect

569
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,150
someone like you

570
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,550
would date a blockhead like my brother.

571
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,840
What am I like?

572
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,550
It's you.

573
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,150
Anyway, I can't imagine

574
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,440
what you'd be like in a relationship.

575
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,190
By the way, I'll give you the gift
next time I go back.

576
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,190
What did my brother give you?

577
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,680
Guess.

578
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,840
Lipstick, or maybe perfume?

579
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,320
That big fool.

580
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,030
Oh, my.

581
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,480
He insisted that we met over dumbbells,

582
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,870
so he absolutely had to give me dumbbells

583
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,150
to commemorate it.

584
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,360
It's truly unbelievable.

585
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,840
Then you should hit his foot again.

586
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,280
That would be even more memorable.

587
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,190
How are things between you and that guy?

588
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,880
You're blushing.

589
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,510
Shanghai's too hot.

590
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,800
You like him?

591
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,230
I think you two are quite alike.

592
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,070
You don't like me, do you?

593
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
I mean

594
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,960
you're both really smart

595
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,190
and work really hard.

596
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,630
You seem cold,

597
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,670
but you're actually kind-hearted.

598
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,720
Rose,

599
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,880
I envy you so much.

600
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,440
It's always about weighing pros and cons
for most people.

601
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,800
But you're different.

602
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,710
You seem to be born
with the ability to love.

603
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,840
What a rare gift.

604
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,550
Su, do you love my brother?

605
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,000
I don't have that much talent for love,

606
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,110
but I'm trying to learn.

607
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,550
Oh, my.

608
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,920
This call couldn't have come
at a better time.

609
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,190
What did you find out?

610
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,280
Yanji?

611
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,810
Why didn't he go
to Harbin Institute of Technology?

612
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,960
He did his undergrad at Fudan,

613
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,110
and he even got a scholarship.

614
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,430
Anything else?

615
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,960
Is it true or not?

616
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,390
Anything else?

617
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,510
Alright.

618
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,950
I got it.

619
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,470
Thanks.

620
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,710
Though he seems fine,

621
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,590
from what I heard,

622
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,030
he's just an ordinary and practical guy.

623
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,030
He's leagues away
from being right for my sister.

624
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,300
He's not even her boyfriend yet,

625
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,820
and you're already
checking his background.

626
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,880
That's why

627
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,920
I need to check it now.

628
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,320
Do you think one's background matters?

629
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,120
It depends on the person.

630
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,000
If they're good,
the background won't matter.

631
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,670
Then why are you investigating

632
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,110
Rose's boyfriend?

633
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,360
If he's not good, how can she like him?

634
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,840
Don't you know Rose?

635
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,480
Once she falls in love,
she disregards everything.

636
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,110
You're right.

637
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,480
She's an adult now.

638
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,550
I shouldn't interfere so much.

639
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,360
Though Rose might not always
make the right choices...

640
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,230
Wait. The weight is wrong.

641
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,000
I thought it was heavy.

642
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,880
But she has a high margin of error.

643
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,280
What's that margin of error?

644
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,110
Drop your shoulders.

645
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,320
I've noticed

646
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,110
everyone in your family
seems to have this ability.

647
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,510
Even if you make the wrong choice,

648
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,760
you can still self-correct and improve.

649
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Are you praising her or me?

650
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,000
Can't you tell?

651
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,630
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

652
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,590
If one day we can't part amicably,

653
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,550
remember

654
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,440
to get back on track.

655
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,390
Don't blame me,

656
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,710
and don't bother me.

657
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,280
That's not gonna happen.

658
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm sure you're the one for me.

659
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,320
You can't get rid of me now.

660
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,630
I can't take it anymore.

661
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,480
No, no. Give me three more.

662
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll help you. Come on.

663
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,280
Three.

664
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,240
You can do it.

665
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,240
Ms. Jiang.

666
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
Alright, alright.

667
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,510
When did you become so needy?

668
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,280
You're the first person to come

669
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,670
to Shanghai to see me,
except for my family.

670
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,110
Don't flatter yourself.

671
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,440
I came for a business trip,

672
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,760
not just to see you.

673
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,630
I don't care. I'm happy.

674
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,960
You're not mad at me, are you?

675
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,800
When did I get mad at you?

676
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,320
You didn't reply to my text messages.

677
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,440
I'm your boss, not your friend.

678
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,320
If you wish me a happy new year,
do I have to return the favor?

679
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,480
You can give me some New Year's money.

680
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,280
Sit.

681
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,290
I'm here to test
how well you've been studying.

682
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,480
What am I thinking right now?

683
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,320
Ms. Jiang, I'm not a fortune-teller.

684
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,960
Okay, okay.

685
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,110
I'm not interested
in what you've learned.

686
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Why did you come dressed like this?

687
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,350
Also,

688
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,070
why aren't you wearing lipstick?

689
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,280
Huang Yimei,
how did you become so sloppy?

690
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,200
Do you still remember
how to do your makeup?

691
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,920
There's a charity event today.

692
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,070
You'll accompany me.

693
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,070
I haven't attended

694
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,590
such an event in a long time.

695
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,440
You can't lose your social skills.

696
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,590
Use this opportunity to review it.

697
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,010
Go home and change into a formal dress
before you come find me.

698
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,320
I don't have a dress.

699
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,440
This is Shanghai.

700
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,400
Don't you have a decent dress?

701
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,550
Don't tell anyone
that you've worked for me.

702
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
There are three hours left.

703
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,840
You'd better go buy one.
Don't claim you're poor.

704
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,670
You used to be
so willing to spend on yourself.

705
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,670
I know that.

706
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,800
See you later. Bye-bye.

707
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,990
Wait a minute.

708
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,630
I just wanted to ask you

709
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,400
if you wanted to have dinner together.

710
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,760
Sorry.

711
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,600
I can't tonight.

712
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,640
That's okay.

713
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,840
