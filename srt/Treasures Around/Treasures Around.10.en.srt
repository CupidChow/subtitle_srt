You two were quite bold just now,

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,040
with all that talking.

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,830
Why can't you handle a few chickens?

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,910
City folks are amusing.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,270
Afraid of chickens.

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,070
Look at the pretty boy in the middle.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,070
What's that bulge on his chest?

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,400
Hiding money?

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
Search him.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,470
- I'll search.
- No, no, no.

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,400
Sir, nothing here.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,320
Do you think we're fools?

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,510
Move, move. Turn around.

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,470
Yeah.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Why so bulgy if there's nothing?

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,280
Exactly.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,440
Only these two idiots

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,840
can't tell I'm a woman, right?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,790
I told you they wouldn't tell.

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,720
You didn't believe me.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,670
You're quite proud, huh?

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Stop turning.

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,370
Stop turning.

49
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,880
I said stop turning.

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,510
Why do I hear a woman's voice?

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,280
Is there a woman?

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
What do we do?

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,230
Sir,

54
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,320
it's me.

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,560
No way.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,880
This...

57
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,880
This is a girl.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,750
Quick, tell the boss.

59
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,350
He can enjoy the night.

60
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,350
Alright, alright.

61
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,120
- Boss!
- No.

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Let's go.

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,560
Boss, there's a woman!

64
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,750
Come on.

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,120
- Young Master.
- There's a long-legged girl.

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,190
Why hasn't Liu returned?

67
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,440
Thank you.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,000
Move aside, move aside.

69
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,630
Move aside.

70
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,840
- Liu.
- Move aside.

71
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,030
Move aside.

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
- Liu.
- Move aside.

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,900
Ms. Shuangshuang.

74
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,670
What happened? Why are you so flustered?

75
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,120
My master and Ms. Dandan

76
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,190
were taken by some ruffians.

77
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,070
What?

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,470
- Let's go.
- Alright, this way.

79
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,950
Where's the long-legged girl?

80
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,190
Her legs are so long.

81
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,720
Longer than mine.

82
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,670
Come, come, come.

83
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,790
Boss, this way.

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,910
Look, Boss.

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
This girl.

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,040
Her legs are so long. This is her.

87
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,910
Boss, those legs are long.

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,320
But she's too skinny.

89
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,230
Forget it.

90
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,790
Small as a sparrow, it's still meat.

91
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,720
Tonight, let the boss taste city flavor.

92
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,310
Sir,

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,280
if you don't like it, let us go.

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,350
I'll introduce you to better ones later.

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,550
I don't believe you.

96
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,310
So alike.

97
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,950
So alike.

98
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,040
Who is it?

99
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,910
Me, me.

100
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
You!

101
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,720
What's with that sound?

102
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,430
Interrupting our boss.

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
Exactly.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Boss, continue.

105
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,990
Looks just like her.

106
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Exactly like her.

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,200
Sir, this isn't proper.

108
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,600
Look.

109
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,830
I...

110
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,110
I'm dressed like this now.

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
How about

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,350
you let me change first?

113
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,600
Alright.

114
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,190
My wife's room

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,640
is nearby.

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,200
Her clothes and makeup are there.

117
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,910
Quick, take her to change.

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,720
- Alright, alright.
- Quick, quick.

119
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,960
Untie her. Loosen it.

120
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,600
Slowly.

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Alright, alright.

122
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,840
Let's go. This way.

123
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,270
Look.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,310
Even her back looks the same.

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,960
Darling.

126
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,510
Darling.

127
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,280
Boss, she's changed.

128
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,680
Boss, look.

129
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
The little lady is here.

130
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,350
This...

131
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,990
This isn't just similar.

132
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,720
It's identical.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,520
Don't run, little lady.

134
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,760
Come, come, come.

135
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,550
Where are you going?

136
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,550
Don't rush.

137
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,280
Let me kiss you first.

138
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,390
Stop.

139
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,200
Protect the lady.

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,670
(Heaven!)

141
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,670
(Why does he keep running into me like this?)

142
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,160
Who are you?

143
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Do you know where you are?

144
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,270
Little lady.

145
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,110
What do you mean?

146
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,670
Young Master, I'm here to save you.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Hide behind me.

148
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
Young Master.

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Are you okay?

150
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,590
It's not the time to joke around.

151
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,640
You're still so cheerful.

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,830
Young Master, are you okay?

153
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,240
You go first.

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,000
Go.

155
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,270
Go, go.

156
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,400
Yuncui City is prosperous.

157
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,310
How dare you cause trouble!

158
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,790
Though I've always disliked that Pei guy...

159
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,880
- Shuangshuang.
- Are you okay?

160
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,160
- I'm fine.
- I was so scared.

161
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,910
I'm fine.

162
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,720
- Not a hair out of place.
- Take them and hand to the City Lord.

163
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,740
- Shuangshuang, are you okay?
- Yes.

164
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
- Move.
- Get up.

165
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,910
Quickly.

166
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
- I never expected.
- Go.

167
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,520
In my lifetime,

168
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,070
I get to see you so beautiful.

169
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
What do you know?

170
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,430
A great man knows when to bend.

171
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,310
You've done so many bad things

172
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,880
and are still so sarcastic.

173
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520
So troublesome.

174
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,280
You're quite good-looking.

175
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,710
We should focus on saving lives.

176
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,550
That's the priority.

177
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,590
I'll find the Dongling stone.

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,910
I'll go with you

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
to make sure you don't mess up.

180
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,950
Nothing's wrong
with the scented Dongling stone.

181
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,670
What went wrong?

182
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
If nothing's wrong,

183
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,910
check your jade pieces.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,280
Stop talking nonsense.

185
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,670
Qipei Pavilion's jade is flawless.

186
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Hope so.

187
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,790
Speaking of which,

188
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
who'd most want my Qipei Pavilion to fail?

189
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,310
Isn't it you?

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Same accessories.

191
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,310
Same jade.

192
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,550
Why is there no problem

193
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,950
with your Suyu Pavilion's jade?

194
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,550
What do you mean?

195
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,240
Are you accusing us of framing you?

196
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,240
Haven't you done such things?

197
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,670
Come on, Mr. Pei.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,950
Please talk with evidence.

199
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,520
When your place has issues,

200
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,790
don't just blame others.

201
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,790
Besides,

202
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,880
if I hadn't saved you today,

203
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,910
would you be here talking nonsense?

204
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
You!

205
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,760
Even if you hadn't come,

206
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,880
I could escape.

207
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,750
Really?

208
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
I should've left you there

209
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,120
to be the bandits' concubine.

210
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,040
You changed pretty quickly.

211
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,400
Young Master, I was just looking for you.

212
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,510
They're all upstairs.

213
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,480
I'll take you there.

214
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,190
Young Master, how is it?

215
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,590
This Dongling stone is fine.

216
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,910
Looks like Doctor Qu was right.

217
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,790
She's poisoned by Yin-Yang Jiangtou Weed.

218
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,310
Yin-Yang Jiangtou Weed?

219
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,590
The coarse one is Yang. The fine one is Yin.

220
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,070
They usually grow together.

221
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,070
Even as dried weeds on a table,

222
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,910
they'll move mysteriously

223
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,360
until they intertwine.

224
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,360
After taking root,

225
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,070
they grow in the body.

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
When reaching a certain amount,

227
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,910
they spread rapidly.

228
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,910
Victims get high fever and seizures

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,070
and lose sanity

230
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,120
until they become walking corpses

231
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,640
and die in the end.

232
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,310
So severe. Can it be cured?

233
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,600
Miss,

234
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,640
please save my wife.

235
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,640
Help me prepare some items.

236
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,390
Alright.

237
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,270
Miss.

238
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,240
Here's the black dog blood you asked for.

239
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,030
Darling.

240
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,430
Ms. Shuangshuang,

241
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,880
do you know how to hit acupoints?

242
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,000
It's just what Doctor Qu taught me

243
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,190
to seal the acupoints

244
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,040
and prevent qi and blood from flowing back.

245
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,830
(Why does Shuangshuang
seem like a different person?)

246
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,510
Yu,

247
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,710
let's decoct Doctor Qu's medicine.

248
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,390
Yes.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
After a few doses,

250
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
your wife should recover.

251
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,710
Thank you for saving her life.

252
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,240
Thank you for saving her life.

253
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,760
No need to be so polite, sir.

254
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,040
Luckily, the poisoning wasn't severe.

255
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,000
Otherwise, no one could have saved her.

256
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,160
Shuangshuang, you're amazing.

257
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,040
When did you learn this?

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,430
I happened to meet an amazing doctor.

259
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,070
These villains are so vicious.

260
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,880
A farming couple

261
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,710
couldn't provoke such hatred.

262
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,640
Maybe they're targeting

263
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,830
the scented jade this time.

264
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,000
Mr. Pei, you're overthinking.

265
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,360
It's just a new product development.

266
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,950
Why would it cause hatred?

267
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,520
Moreover, it's commissioned by the City Lord.

268
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,360
It must be someone with old grudges
against Qipei Pavilion

269
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,430
seeking revenge.

270
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,430
Old grudges?

271
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,710
Why are you looking at me?

272
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,640
I've said it many times.

273
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,630
It was not me.

274
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,790
Besides,

275
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,240
if I wanted to use poison,

276
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
wouldn't I poison you directly?

277
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,960
You!

278
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,240
That's true.

279
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,830
Darling. Darling.

280
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
You finally woke up.

281
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,270
Darling.

282
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,400
Great. You're awake.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
Think carefully.

284
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,310
Did anyone else touch the jade bracelet?

285
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,670
Or switch it?

286
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
When I bought the bracelet,

287
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,640
I passed by a thread shop.

288
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,590
Is this the new scented bracelet
from Qipei Pavilion?

289
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,880
What's wrong?

290
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,400
The bracelet is beautiful,

291
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,760
and the scent is lovely.

292
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,000
But the five-color thread

293
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,240
looks a bit rough.

294
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,430
Our thread shop has a new type
of seven-color thread.

295
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,240
(Xiyuan Thread Shop)
Although it looks similar,

296
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,520
it feels softer and smoother.

297
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,560
It doesn't chafe.

298
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,110
Would you like to have a look?

299
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,830
Alright. Let me take a look.

300
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,820
(Xiyuan Thread Shop)

301
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,920
Is this it?

302
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,110
Yes. This is the thread.

303
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,040
I bought it for a few wen.

304
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,960
Without close inspection,

305
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,480
I can't tell if it's seven-color or five-color.

306
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,150
Shuangshuang, look.

307
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,630
This is the shell left
by the Yin-Yang Jiangtou Weed.

308
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,590
They must have blended the poison

309
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,830
into the thread.

310
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,040
These two threads, one Yin and one Yang,

311
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,960
are impossible to burn.

312
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,590
We thought of jade and fragrance,

313
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,830
but not the small connecting thread.

314
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,520
The villain is quite skilled.

315
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,630
Despicable.

316
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,230
Do you remember

317
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,390
what the girl selling the thread

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,920
looked like?

319
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,920
I can't recall clearly.

320
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,920
She had decent looks.

321
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,350
A pretty girl.

322
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,720
How can we investigate this?

323
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,310
At least we know

324
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,630
where the problem is.

325
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,550
If we find that thread shop,

326
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
we'll figure it out.

327
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,110
Now that she's saved,

328
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
and we have a clue,

329
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,240
it proves it's unrelated to my fragrance.

330
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,110
I won't bother you anymore.

331
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
I have work to do.

332
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,710
Farewell.

333
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,360
Well...

334
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,670
It's no bother.

335
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,870
I'm happy

336
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,110
to help you.

337
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,720
If you want to go, just go.

338
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,200
Why so many words?

339
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,230
Farewell.

340
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,390
Farewell.

341
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,740
Young Master,

342
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,440
shall we head to the thread shop now?

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,840
- No.
- No.

344
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,070
Going now will alert them.

345
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,000
Tonight, send people to watch it.

346
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,390
Tomorrow morning we'll go undercover

347
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,790
as customers.

348
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,550
We'll find something out.

349
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,800
Alright.

350
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,070
Not as stupid as I thought.

351
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,920
I'll be kind to the end.

352
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
Tonight, I'll send people to watch for you.

353
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,480
Tomorrow, it's up to you.

354
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,190
I'm leaving.

355
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,860
Shuangshuang, be careful on the road.

356
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,200
We won't disturb you anymore.

357
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,760
Benefactors,

358
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,920
you've worked all day for us,

359
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,680
without a hot meal.

360
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,070
If you don't mind,

361
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,830
stay and have dinner with us.

362
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,990
Yes.

363
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,960
I was so flustered

364
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,390
and made a scene at your house.

365
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,720
I feel ashamed.

366
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,390
Let us make it up to you.

367
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,240
- This...
- Right. It's dark.

368
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,550
Traveling at night is dangerous.

369
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,520
Stay. Have a meal

370
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,350
and a good night's sleep.

371
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,280
You can leave tomorrow morning.

372
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,120
Yes.

373
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,920
Makes sense.

374
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,830
(I wonder if Pei Pei will be comfortable here.)

375
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,630
We won't disturb you.

376
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,630
Let's go, Young Master.

377
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,110
Since they're so hospitable,

378
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,520
let's stay tonight.

379
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,280
Tomorrow morning we'll go to the thread shop.

380
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,760
It would disturb Mother if we return so late.

381
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,280
But...

382
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

383
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,310
Then I'll listen to you.

384
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,440
Do you have more of that pastry?

385
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,240
I'll make you a fresh one.

386
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,070
Alright. Thanks.

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,070
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

388
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,630
- This way.
- Young Master, please.

389
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,700
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

390
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,280
This way.

391
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,140
(Xiyuan Thread Shop)

392
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,390
What secrets are hidden

393
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,390
in such an obscure thread shop?

394
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,070
Nothing seems unusual.

395
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,910
Yu,

396
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,380
have people watch this place overnight.

397
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,870
Don't miss a thing.

398
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,000
If possible,

399
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,760
sneak in without alarming them.

400
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,280
Yes.

401
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,180
You go there.

402
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

403
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,430
- You go that way.
- Yes.

404
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,230
What's wrong?

405
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Nothing.

406
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,280
Just surprised

407
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
that you care so much

408
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
about your rival's issues.

409
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,760
It's unusual.

410
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,550
I think it's not simple.

411
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,830
Qipei Pavilion

412
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,000
has been low-key for years.

413
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,390
They shouldn't have enemies with such grudges.

414
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,390
We should know our enemy.

415
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,040
Better to clear things up.

416
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,960
You're wise, Young Master.

417
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm impressed.

418
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,670
Moreover,

419
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,830
your sister is still there.

420
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,550
No matter who the rival is,

421
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,960
protecting you and your family

422
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,350
is my duty.

423
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,790
Young Master, it's late.

424
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,070
You should go back and rest.

425
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,260
(Xiyuan Thread Shop)

426
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,200
Tired today?

427
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,720
A bit.

428
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,790
And we need to go to the thread shop tomorrow.

429
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,390
If you're tired, why not rest early?

430
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,680
And who wanted to play with fire?

431
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,990
Fine, fine.

432
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,720
Thank you for playing with fire with me.

433
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,070
Actually, I should thank you.

434
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,440
I'd like to hear

435
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,040
how you plan to thank me.

436
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,240
Thank you

437
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,150
for risking your life to save me.

438
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,110
Though your method is...

439
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,240
I still have to thank you.

440
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,440
What about the method?

441
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,440
It shows vision and responsibility.

442
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,630
Or what?

443
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,350
Should I do nothing,

444
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,470
like that ugly painter?

445
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
Exactly.

446
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,110
You just talked about having a vision.

447
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,480
That person's surname is Tan.

448
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,430
Fine.

449
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,840
So what?

450
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,790
Should I be like that Tan

451
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,200
and do nothing?

452
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,310
I can't stand seeing you get bullied.

453
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,680
I heard

454
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,350
you took many jobs to make a living.

455
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,760
And Tan mentioned

456
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,630
you worked as a stable hand.

457
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,590
Honestly, I feel sorry for you.

458
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,630
It's nothing.

459
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,590
I think it's a gift from life.

460
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,350
Looking back,

461
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,110
I miss those days

462
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,440
of running errands.

463
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
My sister and I

464
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,630
used to rely on each other.

465
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
Our family was poor.

466
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,590
I was like a brick,

467
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,390
moving wherever needed.

468
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,280
So,

469
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,520
I've always wanted to be

470
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,200
an excellent jade appraiser.

471
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,790
Once I saved enough money,

472
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,040
I'd open a shop with my sister

473
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,150
and live a carefree life as the boss.

474
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,040
Don't worry, Dandan.

475
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,150
In the future,

476
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,630
I won't let you suffer anymore.

477
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,630
By the way,

478
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,240
who taught you this move

479
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,920
you did with the boss earlier?

480
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,040
Do I need to be taught for that?

481
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,790
- Usually...
- Usually?

482
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,760
The Flower Pavilion.

483
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,470
Right?

484
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,060
No, no.

485
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,000
Did you learn it from Ms. Huadian?

486
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,990
No.

487
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,440
Then who taught you?

488
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,000
- I...
- You definitely learned it from them.

489
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,280
Or from some other girl?

490
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,000
- A girl I don't know?
- I…

491
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,040
Like this.

492
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,480
Stop laughing.

493
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,920
Who taught you?

494
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,920
Watch out.

495
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,040
You're still pretending?

497
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,680

for all the jewelry with added fragrances.

504
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,200
Recalculate and detail them.

505

Send them with the samples

507
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,560
Yes.

Young Master.

509
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,190
How did it go?

510
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,630
Nothing happened
in the first half of the night.

511

In the quiet hours later,

512
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
I snuck in.

513
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,630
The thread shop only had dyes and threads.

514
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,870
Nothing suspicious.

515
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,630
Are you sure you checked every corner?

516
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm sure.

517
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,870
But the shop was too clean.

That's odd.

519
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,480
Almost

520
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,440
as if someone tidied it up.

521
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,310
It shouldn't be.

522
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,790
We returned to the city

523
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,720
immediately after receiving the clue.

524
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,910
Something's wrong.

525
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,190
Something's wrong.

526
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,150
Jue.

527
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,920
Jue, something's wrong.

528
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,280
Big trouble.

529
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,240
(Flower Pavilion)
Quickly, block it.

530
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,090
- Hurry.
- Block it.

531
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,940
Move faster.

532
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,230
Get more people over here.

533
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,960
- Hurry.
- More people over here.

534
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,000
Hurry up.

535
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,960
Lead the guests that way.

536
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,440
Yes, block it.

537
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,960
- Send two more people over there.
- Coming.

538
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,000
Madam Yang, what happened?

539
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,870
It's your Suyu Pavilion's jewelry.

540
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,200
The issue isn't clear yet.

541
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,760
Don't make false accusations.

542
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,150
How am I falsely accusing?

543
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,310
Something's wrong with your scented jewelry.

544
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,680
And you want to deny it?

545
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,560
You...

546
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
Shopkeeper Cui.

547
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Help, quickly.

548
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,990
Shuangshuang.

549
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,760
Dandan.

550
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,240
Looks like I misjudged you.

551
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,110
Are they also wearing the seven-color thread?

552
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,110
We just arrived to investigate.

553
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,000
It's still unclear.

554
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,730
What about the thread shop?
What happened there?

555
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Yu watched all night.

556
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,240
He found no clues.

557
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,720
He sneaked in.

558
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,720
It was spotless.

559
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,350
Like someone had been warned.

560
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,440
It shouldn't be.

561
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,280
No one should know about this.

562
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,880
Dandan.

563
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,880
What happened?

564
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,280
Didn't we resolve it?

565
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,550
You still dare to show up? You...

566
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,040
Suyu Pavilion's jewelry

567
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,590
uses your fragrance.

568
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,350
If something goes wrong,

569
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,850
you're responsible too.

570
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,150
Madam Yang, calm down.

571
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,590
We won't evade this.

572
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,480
If it's our fault,

573
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,630
we'll handle it.

574
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,480
But first, let's solve this.

575
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,630
Dandan is right.

576
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,070
Where did this start?

577
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,310
What's happening now?

578
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,760
Chunqin.

579
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,120
Madam Yang.

580
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,440
The first one affected was Huadian.

581
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,600
Huadian.

582
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,200
Your earrings are beautiful,

583
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,000
and they smell like sandalwood.

584
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,280
These are Suyu Pavilion's

585
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,070
new scented earrings.

586
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,430
Right.

587
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,000
Remember to take my pipa

588
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,240
to Mr. Sun's room later.

589
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,950
Then what happened?

590
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,790
Then, we found

591
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,920
over ten girls at Flower Pavilion

592
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,070
with similar symptoms.

593
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,550
They became like zombies,

594
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,830
biting anyone they saw.

595
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,590
I finally managed to evacuate the guests

596
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,000
and lock them inside.

597
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,520
Speaking of which,

598
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,790
their only commonality

599
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,110
is wearing your Suyu Pavilion's jewelry.

600
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,280
Do they also wear the seven-colored thread?

601
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,280
There seem to be some colorful threads,

602
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,390
but I can't quite remember.

603
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,870
How could this happen?

604
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,040
The farmer's wife didn't have these symptoms.

605
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,000
What happened to these girls?

606
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,830
It must be the higher dose
of the poisonous weed,

607
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,830
making the poisoning worse.

608
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,760
Shuangshuang, can they be treated?

609
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,390
Well...

610
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,550
I can try with Doctor Qu.

611
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,470
Regardless,

612
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,070
this matter started because of us.

613
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,680
The priority is to save lives.

614
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,470
We need to go in.

615
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,680
I'll go with you.

616
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,000
You two wait outside.

617
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,150
No.

618
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,390
We'll go together.

619
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,710
Let's go.

620
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,040
Open the door.

621
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,440
- We're going in to save them.
- What now?

622
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,200
Is this still the bustling Flower Pavilion?

623
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,760
It feels like a haunted castle now.

624
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,390
So eerie and frightening.

625
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,720
If you're scared,

626
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,280
then go back.

627
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,800
Scared?

628
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,710
Ridiculous.

629
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,870
"Scare" isn't even in my dictionary.

630
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,680
The only way to conquer fear

631
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
is to face it. Let's go.

632
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,070
You face it. Go.

633
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,910
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go.

634
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,800
Go face it.

635
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,280
- Let's go.
- Face it.

636
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,800
- Let's go.
- You face it first.

637
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,590
- Who's afraid? Let's go.
- Face it. You go.

638
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,240
You said face it, so you go face it.

639
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,350
Who said we'd face it?

640
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,790
- You face it first.
- You go.

641
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,670
- Why are you pushing me?
- Where are you going?

642
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,110
- Don't retreat.
- You're not afraid. You go.

643
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,390
What are you doing?

644
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Young Master.

645
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,550
There!

646
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,110
Why are you screaming? There's nothing.

647
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,040
There. Didn't you see it just now?

648
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,680
Believe me. There really was a hand there.

649
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,440
Do you know you could scare us to death?

650
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Enough. Stop fooling around.

651
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,200
Mr. Pei, after you.

652
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,520
Mr. Su, after you.

653
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,760
Mr. Su, after you.

654
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,630
Mr. Pei, face the challenge.

655
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,520
Mr. Su, you go first.

656
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
Together.

657
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,390
Let's go together.

658
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
Forward.

659
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,680
Not that frightening.

660
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,040
Look there.

661
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,550
What is that?

662
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,080
Are you okay?

663
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,430
Young Master.

664
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,440
Behind you.

665
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,000
It's fine. No worries.

666
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,110
- Hurry, hurry.
- Young Master.

667
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,910
Go.

668
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,840
Go.

669
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
Here, here, here.

670
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,390
What's that terrifying thing?

671
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,520
What kind of sorcery can make people like this?

672
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,480
Catching and curing them

673
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,590
won't be easy.

674
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,630
Where are the others?

675
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,590
I saw them running that way.

676
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,760
Let's join them.

677
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,600
Hope nothing happens.

678
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,590
- Dandan.
- Oh, my gosh.

679
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,240
Pei Pei.

680
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,640
Pei Pei.

681
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,990
Come.

682
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,800
- Here, here, here.
- Okay.

683
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,960
Tie it, tie it.

684
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,070
Told you to stop reading novels.

685
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,660
They're not zombies.
Holding a breath doesn't work.

686
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,610
Why don't you paste a talisman?

687
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,550
No, I...

688
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,990
Pei Pei.

689
