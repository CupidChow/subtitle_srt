23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,520
Listen to me.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,550
For coloring with colored gold,

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,460
apply a light coat
when the gold is 40-50% melted

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,060
and a deep coat when it's 70-80% melted.

27
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,030
These are high-quality colored gold paints.

28
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,900
Take them with you.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
What are you doing?

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,010
Young Master.

31
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,850
Why aren't you sleeping so late?

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,060
I came out for a walk.

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,460
Is there someone here?

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,410
No, no one.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,460
What are you doing, you jerk?

36
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm here to resign.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,620
Shuangshuang, you go rest first.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
What got into you in the middle of the night?

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
Are you out of your mind?

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,740
I'm not crazy. You are.

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,390
You've served me for ten years.

42
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,590
You've been living here for free.

43
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,650
Good that you know my service.

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,620
What am I to you for these ten years?

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,670
A servant?

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,020
A punching bag?

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,580
A lapdog?

49
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,760
I've been loyal and obedient to you.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,770
But you hit me and scold me whenever you like.

51
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,270
Do you know how envious I am

52
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,180
seeing how Mr. Pei treats Liu?

53
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,300
Do you know how much

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,620
I want you to respect me?

55
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,080
I no longer want to do

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,270
those heinous things for you.

57
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,110
I...

58
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
Fine.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,370
Collect your wages tomorrow

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,550
and get lost.

61
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,300
Over the years,

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,920
has Su Jue ever treated you like a human being?

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,760
Useless!

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Get away.

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,580
How dare you touch her?

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,300
It's done.

67
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,420
The coloring is indeed crucial to the Crown.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,740
The colored gold techniques are extraordinary.

69
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,810
Its color is pure and strong.

70
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,430
With its addition,

71
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,970
the Crown is almost identical
to the one from back then.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,770
Now, just finish the inlay

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
and weld the Crown's body to the top.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,420
Then it's done.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,490
We didn't let the City Lord down.

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Alright, everyone.

77
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,490
You've worked hard all day.

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,960
Go and rest.

79
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,980
Leave the rest of the inlay

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,330
to Pei.

81
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,230
Sun, please.

82
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,070
Let's go.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Not bad.

84
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,930
Why don't you go back?

85
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,540
I'll stay and keep you company.

86
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,520
Be good. Go rest.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,380
You need energy

88
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,690
to support me.

89
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,860
Alright.

90
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,450
Call me if you need anything.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Wait.

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,690
I knew you didn't want me to go.

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,490
I want to give you this.

94
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,740
Keep it, just in case.

95
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,860
(Huaizhou)

96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,820
(Suyu Pavilion)

97
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
Yu.

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,570
Ms. Shuangshuang.

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,810
Why did you help me?

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,450
We're both martial artists.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,710
That day when you returned,

102
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,880
you were clearly injured,

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,570
yet you breathed evenly and showed no pain.

104
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,420
You injured yourself on purpose.

105
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,120
I wanted to check on you,

106
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,370
but he pushed me away.

107
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,180
Why didn't you expose me?

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,830
I don't know

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,910
why you staged this act,

110
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,330
but it must be for Su Jue.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,220
I've had enough of my time with him.

112
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,810
I've endured enough insults.

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,680
I owe the Su family.

114
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,890
I can't hurt him.

115
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
You can punish him. He deserves that.

116
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,860
So, I helped you.

117
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,100
You're a good person.

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,830
Serving such a vile and cruel man

119
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,690
isn't worth it.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,660
Find a better place.

121
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,760
Following him in his misdeeds,

122
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,180
I have nightmares every night.

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,690
This

124
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,300
is a relief.

125
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,660
Don't worry.

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,690
Suyu Pavilion is on the decline.

127
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,130
This time, Su Jue will lose.

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,980
For every evil deed

129
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,890
he's done,

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,060
I'll make him pay.

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,780
Don't blame me

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,220
when I'm harsh on him.

133
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,780
I'm already a stranger to him.

134
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,980
Do as you wish.

135
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,220
(Suyu Pavilion)

136
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,740
(Karma is everywhere.)

137
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,980
(It's time to end this.)

138
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,670
Jue,

139
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,200
Sun Wu

140
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,810
is at Qipei Pavilion.

141
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,810
I know.

142
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,250
They found it.

143
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,230
I heard the Crown is almost complete,

144
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,980
with just the welding left.

145
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,570
We have the colored gold techniques.

146
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,980
How did they complete the coloring?

147
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,490
Before this,

148
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,440
with the gold coloring,

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,810
we had a chance.

150
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,790
But now, compared to them,

151
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,200
our chances are slim.

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,300
We won't lose.

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
Never.

154
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,800
Young Master.

155
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,250
I saw your light was still on,

156
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,330
so I came to check on you.

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,890
What's wrong? You look pale.

158
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,110
Shuangshuang.

159
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,570
If I win this time,

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,570
will you marry me?

161
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,980
If you win,

162
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,420
I'll be here in my wedding dress.

163
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,090
Feels like a dream.

164
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,570
Nonsense.

165
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,450
Dreams aren't real.

166
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,140
Real or not,

167
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,900
it doesn't matter.

168
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
(A few days later)

169
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,740
(Delight and Peace)

170
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,830
Morning.

171
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,240
Morning.

172
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,690
Are you tired?

173
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,830
No.

174
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,400
Really not going to sleep?

175
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,380
I can still continue.

176
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,660
It's almost done.

177
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
Alright.

178
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,590
Keep it up.

179
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,330
You go get busy.

180
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,970
Then I'll leave you to it.

181
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,630
(Pei Pei has been working so hard.)

182
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,970
(He needs some nourishment.)

183
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,110
Squab. Nutritious squab.

184
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,200
The finest wild squab.

185
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,330
- Miss.
- Sir, which one replenishes blood?

186
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,380
The squab, of course. It's very nourishing.

187
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,110
How much is it?

188
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,260
Two taels each.

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Miss,

190
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,870
this is the best wild squab in town.

191
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,920
You can make a squab soup.

192
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,260
It's very nourishing.

193
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,300
I'll take two.

194
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,040
Alright, wait a moment.

195
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
Which one do you like?

196
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,590
The fatter one.

197
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,570
How about this one?

198
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,440
- The left one.
- This?

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,690
- That one.
- Alright.

200
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,540
Young Master, you're awake.

201
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,280
Have some tea.

202
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,690
Why are you here? You startled me.

203
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,400
Dandan went to buy squabs for you,

204
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,810
to nourish your health.

205
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,930
She asked me to watch over you.

206
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
Young Master.

207
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,700
(If you want to save Dandan,
bring the Crown to the forest temple alone.)

208
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,400
This...

209
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,000
You're awake.

210
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,470
Since you're awake,

211
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,930
let's wait for your lover to redeem you.

212
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,180
Su Jue, you jerk!

213
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,180
Young Master, Pei Pei has arrived.

214
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,970
The Crown is here.

215
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,950
Let her go.

216
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,040
Don't give it to him!

217
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,500
How will we explain this to the City Lord?

218
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,450
I don't need to explain to anyone.

219
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,750
I just want you safe.

220
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,780
Shut up.

221
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,710
Look at your situation.

222
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,300
Stop talking nonsense.

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,090
Open the box.

224
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,970
Have you lost your mind

225
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,610
for the mere Crown?

226
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,730
The mere Crown?

227
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,020
You know nothing.

228
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,450
Indeed, I don't understand.

229
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,930
The City Lord appointed us
to restore the Crown.

230
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,560
If you want to claim the credit,

231
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,690
use your skills.

232
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,780
Trying to steal my work?

233
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,380
Would you have no guilt?

234
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,060
Why would I feel guilty

235
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,660
for taking the Crown with my skills?

236
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,350
Besides,

237
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,680
when you took what I loved most,

238
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,060
did you feel guilty?

239
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,930
I've brought the Crown.

240
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,810
Now, I'm taking her away.

241
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,950
Are you alright?

242
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,570
The Crown...

243
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,070
It's not important.

244
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,160
Let's go.

245
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,300
I wanted to kill you two lovebirds together,

246
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,440
but seeing you acting like this,

247
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,930
I've changed my mind.

248
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,610
One of you must die today.

249
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,930
As for who that'll be,

250
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,730
you decide.

251
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,500
You've got the Crown.

252
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,810
Just give it to the Emperor tomorrow,

253
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,570
and the Suyu Pavilion's reputation will spread.

254
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,510
You'll enjoy wealth and glory.

255
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,210
We won't be able to compete with you anymore.

256
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,780
Why do you have to kill?

257
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
Mr. Pei, you talk a lot.

258
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,020
You must be afraid of dying.

259
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,200
Ms. Dandan,

260
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,350
see?

261
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,590
In the face of danger,

262
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,730
your lover is unreliable.

263
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,450
Pei Pei is not like that.

264
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,260
Don't look at me like that.

265
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,660
The Crown

266
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,300
can be remade.

267
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,780
But if I die,

268
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,970
I'll lose everything.

269
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,020
What are you saying?

270
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,500
I don't want to die now.

271
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,900
I didn't expect this from you.

272
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,180
Was it all my delusion?

273
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,510
I thought you were different

274
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,180
from those spoiled nobles.

275
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,060
I thought you were loyal and righteous.

276
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,090
I thought my sincerity

277
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,450
would be returned.

278
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,810
In the end,

279
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,060
I was wrong.

280
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,180
You're the one

281
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,810
Su Jue wants to kill.

282
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,330
He sees you as his rival

283
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,810
who steals his thunder.

284
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,660
Now,

285
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,060
you use me as a scapegoat.

286
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,610
If not for you,

287
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,570
I wouldn't be here.

288
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,280
Su Jue,

289
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,210
kill me if you must.

290
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,900
Interesting.

291
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,730
The lovebirds betray each other in danger.

292
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,570
You?

293
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,610
I've changed my mind.

294
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,570
Killing Pei's lover

295
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,300
would be more satisfying.

296
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,910
Dandan!

297
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,220
Young Master, what is...?

298
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,350
Yes.

299
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,700
Why are you here?

300
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,220
I received this.

301
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
I gave your letter

302
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,780
to Ms. Shuangshuang immediately.

303
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,410
Ms. Shuangshuang hates me,

304
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,980
but Dandan is her sister.

305
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,610
She wouldn't ignore this.

306
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,090
Despicable.

307
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,060
Such a jerk!

308
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,410
Young Master.

309
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,020
We've got the Crown.

310
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,680
Since we got it,

311
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,700
please let them leave.

312
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,850
Go!

313
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
Let's go.

314
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,330
Young Master.

315
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,410
They didn't follow us.

316
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,650
You scared me.

317
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
When I saw that letter,

318
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,940
I was so worried.

319
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,500
I was afraid something might happen to you.

320
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,400
You seemed calm and confident.

321
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,410
Very cool.

322
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,500
I was acting.

323
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,330
Quite convincingly.

324
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,710
Even in danger,

325
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,030
you thought to ask Shuangshuang for help.

326
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,330
Smart move.

327
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,850
Of course.

328
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,940
I have to act with you to make it work.

329
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,060
How dare you come alone?

330
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,020
For you, I'd face any danger.

331
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,160
And Ms. Shuangshuang will be here soon.

332
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,300
She's our backup.

333
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,850
Pei Pei is not like that.

334
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,940
I don't want to die now.

335
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,850
Did I hurt you?

336
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,070
I'm used to it.

337
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,170
Let's go.

338
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,700
(Peace and Tranquility)

339
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,090
We'll meet the City Lord tomorrow.

340
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,610
But our Crown was stolen

341
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,500
by Su Jue.

342
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,810
- I...
- Don't move.

343
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,090
What now?

344
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,780
The Crown is gone,

345
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,880
but we are safe. That's what matters.

346
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,570
- But...
- No buts.

347
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,780
After this kidnap,

348
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,170
I know

349
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,940
you're far more important

350
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,220
than I ever imagined.

351
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,830
Dandan,

352
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
promise me.

353
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,710
No matter what,

354
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,220
don't risk your life.

355
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,370
Don't leave me.

356
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
Alright?

357
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,250
Be safe.

358
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,370
Don't worry.

359
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,810
Wait for me.

360
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,940
(Xuanzheng Hall)

361
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,610
The City Lord has arrived.

362
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,890
Greetings, Your Lordship.

363
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,200
Rise.

364
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,130
Suyu Pavilion did not fail you.

365
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,890
Today, I present the Crown.

366
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,990
Based on the original Moonlight Crown,

367
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,120
this one is enhanced

368
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,710
with twelve colored gold techniques,

369
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,470
nine jade carving methods,

370
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,840
and forty-nine precious materials

371
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,510
inlaid on it.

372
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,700
The top is especially adorned

373
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,890
with a thousand-year-old luminous pearl.

374
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,960
I hope it pleases you, Your Lordship.

375
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,800
Impressive.

376
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,400
To create such a stunning Crown
in such a short time.

377
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,700
I didn't misjudge you.

378
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,230
This is far better

379
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,610
than your father's work.

380
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,910
However,

381
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,330
this is an assignment from the Emperor.

382
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,940
I had to be cautious,

383
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,220
so I asked someone else to recreate it.

384
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,060
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Su.

385
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,910
Not at all.

386
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,610
Let Pei Pei come in.

387
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,020
(This thief stole my crown)

388
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,500
(but insists on using his work,)

389
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,500
(truly persistent and vile.)

390
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
Greetings, Your Lordship.

391
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Rise.

392
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,800
Mr. Pei,

393
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,570
how's the restoration of the Moonlight Crown?

394
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,610
Please take a look, Your Lordship.

395
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,350
Good.

396
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,780
Very good.

397
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,570
This seems like the Moonlight Crown.

398
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,890
No gold coloring

399
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,020
and no traces of previous carvings.

400
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,640
But it appears

401
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,570
more exquisite

402
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,980
than the original.

403
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,300
Mr. Pei,

404
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,740
how did you achieve this?

405
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,850
Thanks to Mr. Sun's help.

406
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,230
Without you,

407
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,980
I'd be lost.

408
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,170
That's not true.

409
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,510
What do you mean?

410
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,610
Did you really want to give the Emperor

411
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,060
an exact replica of the old Crown?

412
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,550
Pei,

413
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,540
you are my son.

414
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,130
You should know

415
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,020
indigo comes from blue but is bluer than blue,

416
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,500
and ice is made from water
but is colder than water.

417
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,740
Restoring the Crown

418
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,370
isn't difficult.

419
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,120
After all these years,

420
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,130
haven't our family

421
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,570
and Qipei Pavilion

422
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,130
improved at all?

423
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,030
Dad...

424
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,920
Pei,

425
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,500
you don't need the gold coloring

426
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
or Mr. Sun Wu's techniques.

427
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,410
Those are from the past.

428
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,960
The times have changed.

429
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,570
You need to craft a Crown with your own skills.

430
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,330
I believe you can do it.

431
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,130
But the current Crown is already halfway done.

432
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,480
This...

433
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,700
I think they make a good point.

434
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,130
Since you've mastered the technique,

435
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,790
there's no need

436
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,090
to make an identical one.

437
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
This

438
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,920
is the perfect chance

439
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,300
to prove yourself.

440
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,120
Besides, we have enough time.

441
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,400
We'll continue

442
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,550
making the restored Crown

443
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,610
and create another Crown with our own skills.

444
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,370
If the City Lord and the Emperor don't like it,

445
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,540
I'll wear it myself.

446
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,300
Your Lordship,

447
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,400
the original Moonlight Crown

448
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,700
was magnificent,

449
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,540
but it's an old item.

450
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,850
Times have changed.

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,410
A simple replica

452
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,130
won't show our sincerity

453
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,650
or Qipei Pavilion's dedication to improving

454
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,270
our craft without distractions

455
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,980
over the years.

456
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,400
This new Crown

457
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,780
has no excess colors,

458
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,740
only refined elegance.

459
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,090
Its simplicity and nobility stand out.

460
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,500
In jade carving,

461
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,500
both hollowing and filigree techniques

462
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,060
are twice as precise.

463
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,330
Each cut shows skill.

464
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,850
In welding,

465
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,230
I developed a new clasp method,

466
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,360
allowing easy assembly

467
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,680
for both large ceremonies

468
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,370
and small gatherings.

469
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,480
Though

470
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,500
the original water amber is gone,

471
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,370
it still shines brightly,

472
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,890
evoking memories for the Emperor and Empress.

473
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,890
Well said. Times have changed.

474
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,460
Qipei Pavilion is as impressive as I thought.

475
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,910
Someone.

476
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,790
Take the Crown from Qipei Pavilion

477
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,650
and send it swiftly to the Capital.

478
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,350
Come on.

479
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,870
Pei Pei,

480
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,170
if the Emperor likes it,

481
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,750
no past mistakes will matter.

482
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,270
Even if the sky falls,

483
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,700
I'll assure you

484
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,400
and Qipei Pavilion

485
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,980
will stand forever in Yuncui City.

486
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,500
Thank you, Your Lordship.

487
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,790
Of course,

488
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,850
Suyu Pavilion also performed well.

489
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,750
Especially the crown craft,

490
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,840
much improved

491
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,550
since the Jade Competition.

492
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,790
You have innovative techniques, but...

493
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,300
No need to say more, Your Lordship.

494
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760
I lost,

495
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,540
fair and square.

496
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,020
It seems everyone has decided.

497
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
In that case,

498
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,810
let's end here today.

499
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,040
Young Master.

500
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,570
This is Ms. Shuangshuang,
applying for a silver craftsman position.

501
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,940
Greetings, Mr. Su.

502
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,630
So beautiful.

503
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,410
I promised you.

504
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,460
If you won,

505
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,460
I'd wait here in my wedding dress.

506
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,890
I lost.

507
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,170
Take off the dress.

508
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,260
I've never worn a wedding dress before.

509
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,500
Since I have,

510
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,850
I'll wear it a bit longer.

511
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,310
Fine.

512
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,880
Seeing you in a wedding dress

513
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,940
once in my life,

514
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,650
I can

515
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,060
die without regret.

516
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,410
Really?

517
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,810
You have no regrets,

518
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,460
but I do.

519
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,810
What regrets do you have?

520
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,890
To find your father's killer

521
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,020
or to kill Pei Pei?

522
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,300
You once said

523
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,570
Mr. Su is a respectable man,

524
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,700
living a clean life

525
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,300
without any blemishes.

526
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,060
But I'm sorry.

527
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,610
Mr. Su is not clean.

528
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,610
If you think Pei Pei is your father's killer,

529
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,770
I must tell you

530
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,650
what I've done.

531
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,740
During the jade competition,

532
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,500
I cheated

533
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,330
and framed him for plagiarism,

534
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,090
so he lost the competition.

535
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,840
I bought all the raw stones from everywhere,

536
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,070
forcing Qipei Pavilion

537
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,550
to make gold and silver jewelry.

538
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,740
I hired Cuiliu to frame Pei Pei.

539
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,700
I bribed servants

540
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,890
to poison Madam Pei.

541
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,440
Even Pei Chufeng

542
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,920
was locked in my dungeon

543
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,410
for years.

544
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,890
Too many things

545
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,060
to remember.

546
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,330
I know

547
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,020
you don't care about these.

548
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,270
I can tell you

549
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,440
those things that concern you.

550
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
Shuangshuang,

551
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,850
the Su family kill

552
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,540
Shan Jingtian back then

553
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,300
and stole the Moonlight Crown.

554
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,780
Shuangshuang, you hated the wrong person.

555
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,520
I am

556
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,500
the son of your father's killer.

557
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,890
Revealing all my secrets

558
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,980
feels so liberating.

559
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,890
Now, you see me

560
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,300
as the Su Jue with no secrets.

561
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,330
It's a pity

562
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,780
I can't marry you.

563
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,550
Following him in his misdeeds,

564
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,020
I have nightmares every night.

565
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,550
This

566
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,780
is a relief.

567
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,460
Don't worry.

568
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,890
Suyu Pavilion is on the decline.

569
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,890
This time, Su Jue will lose.

570
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,890
For every evil deed

571
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,780
he's done,

572
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,020
I'll make him pay.

573
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,810
Thank you for playing along
with me during this time.

574
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,300
This period

575
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,980
has been the happiest of my life.

576
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,540
Since you knew all along,

577
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,650
why didn't you expose me?

578
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,460
I didn't want to.

579
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,570
With the end approaching,

580
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,700
nothing matters anymore.

581
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,810
Spending a few more days with you

582
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,330
is enough.

583
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,630
Shuangshuang,

584
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,300
I'm tired.

585
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,090
I can't fight anymore.

586
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,410
These days have been hard on you.

587
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,790
The City Lord knows

588
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,260
about the Su family's shameless acts

589
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,170
against Pei's family

590
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,370
but lacks evidence.

591
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,840
Mr. Pei,

592
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,700
do you have any proof against the Su family?

593
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,680
One of our goldsmiths

594
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,330
has been undercover at Suyu Pavilion.

595
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,980
She invited us to the Su's Mansion tonight,

596
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
claiming she could

597
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,440
get Su Jue to confess.

598
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,570
A confession?

599
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,340
Please invite the City Lord to come.

600
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,560
Alright.

601
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,340
Are your guests all here?

602
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,730
Your friends are late.

603
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,290
I fear I can't wait any longer.

604
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,600
Shuangshuang,

605
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,500
if you get the chance,

606
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,290
tell Pei Pei

607
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,090
that

608
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,540
he won.

609
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,980
I'm not as good as him.

610
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,060
If only I had

611
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,420
admitted it sooner.

612
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,210
My life was spent

613
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,900
in the longing for victory,

614
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,460
fighting and striving.

615
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,380
Now that I'm defeated,

616
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,820
I don't even know

617
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,250
how it started or why.

618
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,820
In the end,

619
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,380
I lost my skills,

620
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,860
my life,

621
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,250
and you.

622
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,650
What have you done?

623
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,770
Where's the antidote?

624
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,770
It's too late.

625
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,800
Don't...

626
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,340
Don't cry.

627
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,980
Shuangshuang.

628
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,690
Even if all I did

629
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,670
was wrong,

630
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,730
there's one thing

631
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,570
I never regretted.

632
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,420
That's falling in love with you.

633
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,940
Shuangshuang,

634
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,980
I want to ask you something.

635
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,860
Go ahead.

636
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,420
In your life,

637
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,770
did you ever love me?

638
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,420
These days, facing hardships with you,

639
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,860
I've realized

640
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,250
how important

641
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,060
you are to me.

642
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,210
I've made up my mind.

643
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,650
I want to spend my life

644
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,460
with you.

645
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,990
Shuangshuang,

646
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,690
will you marry me?

647
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,860
Even for a moment?

648
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,110
Qipei Pavilion restored the Crown,

649
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,720
earning imperial rewards of good land and gold.

650
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
(Huaizhou)
From today onwards,

651
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,550
Pei Pei, as its head, will oversee

652
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,980
the tribute jade from across the nation.

653
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,320
(Qipei Pavilion)
Award Qipei Pavilion with a gold plaque.

654
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,510
- to remind it to be diligent and progressive
- Be careful.

655
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,630
as the lead in the jade industry
for the reputation of Yuncui City.

656
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,470
You are hereby commanded.

657
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,460
Alright, alright.

658
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,090
This imperial plaque is truly majestic.

659
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,460
Well said.

660
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,340
Master, shall we...?

661
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,820
Let's go inside and have a look.

662
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,510
Come, this way.

663
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,350
Careful.

664
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,860
How is it, my shopkeeper?

665
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,350
Satisfied?

666
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,570
Very satisfied.

667
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,900
We'll craft jade for the royal family.

668
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,020
We must be meticulous.

669
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,860
Ms. Shuangshuang.

670
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,280
Ms. Shuangshuang, have a zongzi.

671
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
Slow down.

672
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Even if you're healed,
you shouldn't run around.

673
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I'm fine. My legs are strong.

674
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,920
- But you still shouldn't...
- If you care for me,

675
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,990
I'll assume

676
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,540
I can fall for you again.

677
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,340
Sorry to interrupt.

678
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,990
Is everything ready?

679
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,340
Yes, Young Master. It's ready. Look.

680
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,860
(Shuangshuang Jewelry Shop)

681
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,690
Isn't this name a bit casual?

682
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,090
I think so.

683
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,440
(Shuangshuang Jewelry Shop)
I wanted a more elegant name,

684
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,550
but he went ahead

685
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,090
and made the sign.

686
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,150
What's wrong with "Shuangshuang"?

687
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,720
I think that is lovely.

688
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,070
It signifies double blessings,

689
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,440
double happiness, double skills,

690
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,720
- unmatched in the world.
- Enough, enough.

691
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,800
Sounds good.

692
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,720
You're

693

My young master has great taste,

699
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,960
unlike those martial arts brutes.

700
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,940
They don't understand our creativity.

No, I said you're excellent.

What excellence?

707
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,320
That's not what you said.

708
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,630
- I said it...
- Don't run.

709
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,980
Dandan, no, no.

710
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,070
