What to do?

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,140
This door...

32
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,500
You! Go away.

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,660
Dandan, Dandan.

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,020
Dandan.

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,500
What are you doing?

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,460
What are you doing? You scared me.

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,220
I'm telling you.

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
This is all your Su family's fault.

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,260
If anything happens to Young Master,

40
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,380
I won't forgive you.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,900
He volunteered to be here.

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,060
His life or death

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,700
is not Suyu Pavilion's responsibility.

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,980
You bootlicker, are you even human?

45
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,700
Don't be ungrateful. I'm telling you.

46
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,780
Who are you

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,340
to call me a bootlicker?

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,460
What am I?

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
Our young master calls me his brother

50
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,540
in front of everyone he meets.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,700
What about you?

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,260
Do you dare to call yourself that?

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,540
What do you mean?

54
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,380
What do you mean?

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,500
You want to fight?

56
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,630
What are you staring at?

57
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,820
- Want to fight?
- Dandan.

58
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Liu, what are you doing?

59
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,540
Let's go.

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,660
Stay away from me.

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,620
Gosh.

62
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,980
Shuangshuang, are you okay?

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm fine. You?

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,500
The rope.

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,060
Dandan.

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,100
Scared me to death.

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
- Are you okay?
- How are you?

68
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,220
I'm fine.

69
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Now, it's alright.

70
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,820
It's alright.

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,220
Come on.

72
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,660
Didn't you see who you were running with?

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,100
Yu, go ask Doctor Qu for help immediately.

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,220
Yes.

75
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,380
Young Master.

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,940
Where's the first patient, Huadian?

77
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,940
Seems she's not here.

78
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,460
Where's Mr. Tan?

79
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,660
Mr. Tan?

80
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,220
Mr. Tan?

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,620
Liu,

82
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,180
you stay here and guard.

83
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,900
We'll check Huadian's room.

84
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,220
- Let's go.
- Okay.

85
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,220
Mr. Tan?

86
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,980
Dandan.

87
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,780
How are you?

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Are you okay?

89
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm fine.

90
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,060
Are you hurt?

91
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,140
As soon as she entered,

92
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,900
she lunged at me, trying to bite me.

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,260
I thought I was doomed today.

94
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,420
Unexpectedly,

95
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,220
she suddenly trembled all over

96
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,900
and fainted.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,440
These earrings are from your shop, right?

98
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,420
Yes, they are.

99
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,820
But there's no seven-colored thread on them.

100
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,900
It's obvious someone tampered with them.

101
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,820
I just checked all the rooms and their bodies

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,260
but found no seven-colored threads.

103
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,460
Yet their symptoms clearly indicate

104
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,460
poisoning by the Yin-Yang Jiangtou weed,

105
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,940
and they are severely poisoned.

106
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,700
This must be related
to the seven-colored thread.

107
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,020
Our only lead now

108
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,460
is the thread shop.

109
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,340
We can only try our luck there.

110
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,340
The shop has clearly been cleaned.

111
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,580
Is it still worth going?

112
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
Since they already know,

113
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,140
we don't need to hide anymore.

114
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,900
Let's talk to them directly.

115
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,780
Alright.

116
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,660
Let's go.

117
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,340
What can I do for you?

118
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,060
Judging by your stance,

119
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,380
you don't seem to be here to choose threads.

120
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,700
What brings you here?

121
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Stop pretending.

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,100
Everyone is talking about the poisoning

123
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,340
with the scented jewelry.

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,340
Haven't you heard about it?

125
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,100
Your seven-colored thread is involved.

126
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,580
If you're behind this,

127
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,820
I'll smash your shop ten times over.

128
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,220
Sir,

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,500
what are you talking about?

130
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,340
We conduct our business honestly.

131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,340
How could we do such a harmful thing?

132
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,180
You...

133
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,460
I wonder if the thread you mentioned

134
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,580
is this one.

135
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,820
We do sell

136
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,100
these colorful threads,

137
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,580
but we really don't know

138
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
what our customers do with them.

139
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,020
I know you all are powerful.

140
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,050
We can't afford to offend you.

141
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,820
But this scented jewelry incident,

142
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,580
whether it's your own fault

143
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,700
or a setup,

144
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,460
has nothing to do with us.

145
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,900
You're being unreasonable.

146
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,700
Are you trying to bully us?

147
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,020
Sir, we don't mean that.

148
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,700
It's just that this involves many parties.

149
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,940
Please understand.

150
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,420
Shopkeeper,

151
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,580
have you hired any

152
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,660
temporary workers recently?

153
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,580
Just tell the truth and you'll be fine.

154
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,260
A couple of days ago, we were busy,

155
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,140
so we did hire a sales assistant.

156
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,700
Is it a woman? What does she look like?

157
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,700
Fair-skinned.

158
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,900
About this tall. Thin.

159
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,780
Why?

160
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,100
Okay.

161
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Did you find the suspect?

162
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,660
No, just some personal matters.

163
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Everyone, please stay calm.

164
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,140
Su Jue, Pei Pei,

165
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,750
the City Lord has summoned you urgently.

166
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,700
You useless lot.

167
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,340
I ordered you to develop scented jewelry,

168
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,680
and now you've caused such a huge mess,

169
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
panicking the entire city,

170
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,260
before the business prospers.

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Tell me. What do you plan to do?

172
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Your Lordship,

173
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,340
my Tan's Perfume Shop's perfume

174
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,820
is used in dozens of jade shops.

175
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,020
There has never been such an incident before.

176
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,260
You're quick to shirk responsibility.

177
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,340
To be honest,

178
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,780
this matter has nothing

179
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,940
to do with the perfume shop.

180
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,580
Nothing's wrong with our jade either.

181
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,240
You all claimed you did nothing wrong.

182
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,100
Then where is the problem?

183
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Your Lordship,

184
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,140
we discovered that a seven-colored thread

185
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,900
is involved in this case,

186
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,460
but we haven't found conclusive evidence yet.

187
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,860
Indeed.

188
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,140
The thread is made
from the Yin-Yang Jiangtou weed.

189
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,700
The poisoned patients are likely linked to it.

190
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,380
Jiangtou weed?

191
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,660
Do you think you can just make up a weed

192
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,020
to fool me?

193
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,660
There's no evidence for the weed,

194
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,260
but there's plenty to arrest you.

195
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,260
Guards, lock them up.

196
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
Wait!

197
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,860
Your Lordship,

198
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,340
we are also victims
of the scented jade incident.

199
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,660
We are doing our best to investigate.

200
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,220
Give us one more day.

201
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,900
If we can't give you a satisfactory answer

202
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,260
by this time tomorrow,

203
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,820
you can chop my head if you want.

204
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,300
Please reconsider, Your Lordship.

205
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,180
Fine.

206
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,460
I'll give you one more day.

207
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,340
If nothing changes by tomorrow,

208
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
I will take your lives

209
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,460
to appease the public.

210
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,820
Yes.

211
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,100
(Pei's Mansion)

212
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,940
Did you understand?

213
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,820
(Kylin of Auspiciousness)
Yes, I understand.

214
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,380
- Madam.
- Mother, are you okay?

215
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,460
I'm fine.

216
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,940
What are you doing?

217
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,100
By order of the City Lord,

218
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,700
we are to place the head
of Qipei Pavilion under house arrest.

219
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,340
If the poisoning case is not resolved

220
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,940
by 11 pm tomorrow,

221
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,920
she'll be executed at the city gate
to calm the people.

222
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,020
Executed?

223
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,700
This has nothing to do with us.

224
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,220
We are investigating too.

225
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,620
We are just following orders.

226
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,780
Sorry for the offense.

227
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Mother, they didn't harm you, did they?

228
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,580
Don't worry. I'm fine.

229
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,340
You and Dandan go investigate.

230
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,940
I'll wait here.

231
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,460
I believe in you.

232
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,980
You've kept it a secret all day.

233
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,940
You can tell me now.

234
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,540
You've figured it out too?

235
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,480
Of course.

236
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,980
I know you wouldn't brag

237
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,980
in front of the City Lord.

238
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,100
But it's still just a hypothesis.

239
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,980
I'm only 80% sure.

240
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,460
What about the other 20%?

241
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,580
The madam's life is not a joke.

242
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,580
It must be foolproof.

243
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,820
(Su's Mansion)

244
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,090
- Jue.
- Uncle.

245
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,640
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

246
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,940
We've arrived.

247
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,940
You can leave now.

248
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,140
Leave?

249
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,580
Do you think we were escorting you?

250
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,340
- You...
- Well, officers.

251
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,860
What do you mean?

252
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,300
By the City Lord's order,

253
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,220
we should detain Su Jue.

254
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,060
But seeing he is still investigating,

255
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,520
we've only lifted the house arrest.

256
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,060
If there's no progress by tomorrow,

257
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,420
the head of Suyu Pavilion will be executed

258
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,580
to calm the people.

259
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,460
Officer,

260
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,100
I am also in charge of Suyu Pavilion.

261
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,700
You can arrest me instead.

262
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,620
Everyone knows Suyu Pavilion has only one head,

263
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,700
and that's Su Jue.

264
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Wait until he passes the business
to you before speaking up.

265
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
- I...
- Let's go.

266
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,580
What now?

267
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,660
Let's go back first.

268
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,600
Alright.

269
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,060
Hurry and close the door.

270
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,460
Yes.

271
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,460
Hurry.

272
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
What are you doing here?

273
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,220
Nothing.

274
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,020
You took the Master's Document.

275
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,820
Did you change the master's name to your own?

276
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,020
Don't misunderstand. I'm not after the fortune.

277
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,300
Once this crisis is over,

278
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,780
I'll change it back.

279
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
I know that.

280
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,820
The City Lord wants the master's head,

281
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,780
so you

282
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,060
changed the name to yours.

283
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,300
You are the young master and the future

284
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,660
of Qipei Pavilion.

285
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,940
It can't go on without you.

286
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,820
But I can't let you take this risk.

287
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,540
I'm willing to use my head

288
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,660
to save the madam.

289
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,380
I grew up without parents.

290
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,300
Before I met the madam,

291
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,420
I didn't know
what it felt like to be protected.

292
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,700
Madam trusted, loved,

293
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,660
and spoiled me.

294
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,780
I can't let her bear any risk.

295
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,620
Silly girl.

296
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,900
In my heart,

297
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,700
you have always been part of our Pei family.

298
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,820
But given your status in Qipei Pavilion,

299
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,580
you can't be the master.

300
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,700
The City Lord won't believe it,

301
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,190
nor will it convince the public.

302
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
Then

303
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,140
let's get married now.

304
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,900
Of course, I want to marry you immediately.

305
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,140
But

306
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,060
you still can't become the master

307
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,540
of Qipei Pavilion right away.

308
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,500
Why?

309
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,140
Changing the master

310
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,820
requires an application and approval.

311
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,180
Silly girl.

312
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,900
What should we do now?

313
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,900
Don't worry.

314
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,340
We'll find a way.

315
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,340
Young Master,

316
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,140
we caught someone.

317
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,540
Cuiliu?

318
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,300
Young...

319
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,660
Young Master.

320
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,300
The evidence you mentioned is...

321
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,060
What evil deed did you commit? Speak.

322
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,060
Young Master, what are you talking about?

323
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
I don't understand.

324
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,780
Those petty thefts

325
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,740
you normally did.

326
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,900
I didn't bother to argue with you.

327
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,880
But now you've done something

328
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,060
that endangers lives.

329
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,340
Tell me.

330
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,700
Were you the one prying
at the thread shop today?

331
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,460
Were you the temporary worker

332
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,500
at the thread shop a few days ago?

333
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,160
And the one familiar
with the seven-colored thread

334
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,180
and Qipei Pavilion jewelry?

335
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,500
Young Master, I was wrong.

336
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,180
You've worked here since you were young.

337
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,420
My mother may have scolded you sometimes,

338
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,060
but she never mistreated you.

339
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
Now you put her in danger

340
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,900
of losing her head.

341
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,020
Do you have any sense of shame

342
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,020
or conscience?

343
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Madam.

344
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
Madam.

345
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,300
Madam, I know I was wrong.

346
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,260
Cuiliu,

347
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
if it's you,

348
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,420
you are truly foolish.

349
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,500
You've been with us since you were twelve.

350
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,780
No matter what,

351
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,900
we have a bond as master and servant.

352
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,680
Whether it's your narrow-mindedness

353
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,180
or ambition,

354
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,660
it's human nature.

355
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,540
But if you've made a grave mistake

356
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,820
and don't repent,

357
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,300
even the heavens can't help you.

358
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,660
Madam.

359
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,780
Young Master.

360
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,540
I truly know I was wrong.

361
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,780
I didn't know

362
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,260
it would get this serious.

363
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,260
You grew up in our house.

364
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
How could you come up
with such a sinister plan?

365
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,940
Who instructed you to do this?

366
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,020
If you redeem yourself

367
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,700
by helping us solve the case,

368
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,060
I can plead for mercy before the City Lord.

369
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,140
I've served the young master
faithfully for years.

370
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,260
Why did I end up like this?

371
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,180
Shan Dandan is a wretch.

372
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,140
What bewitching trick did she use

373
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,940
to make the young master obey her?

374
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,300
God above,

375
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,020
please show me a way out.

376
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,820
The way is not given by gods

377
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,060
but earned by oneself.

378
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,540
Who are you?

379
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,540
Someone who can help you.

380
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,420
How will you help me?

381
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,420
We have a common enemy.

382
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,060
If you cooperate with me,

383
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,580
I can ruin Shan Dandan's reputation

384
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,860
and get her expelled from Pei's Mansion.

385
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,940
Then,

386
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,940
your young master will bring you back.

387
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,180
Is that true?

388
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,500
My word is my bond.

389
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,780
(It can't get worse than now.)

390
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
(Might as well take a chance.)

391
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
What do you need me to do?

392
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,900
Very well.

393
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,660
There's a thread shop on West Market.

394
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,140
I need you to secretly keep this

395
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,300
and apply for a job there.

396
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,940
As for how to sell it and to whom,

397
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,060
I will inform you in advance.

398
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,540
Here.

399
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,980
Do you remember what the person

400
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,820
who used you looked like?

401
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,100
I think I know who it is.

402
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,460
Him?

403
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,060
Not necessarily.

404
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,620
You mean...

405
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,540
Do you have a way to make him appear?

406
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,580
Whenever I needed to find him,

407
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,100
I'd leave a symbol at the old temple.

408
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Here's the plan.

409
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,780
We'll divide and conquer.

410
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Liu, you and Cuiliu will lure him out.

411
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,750
Young Master, you will surround
and capture him.

412
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I have somewhere to go.

413
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,940
Tomorrow morning,

414
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,980
we'll meet at the temple.

415
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,860
Where are you going?

416
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Can you handle it alone?

417
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,900
Don't worry.

418
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,980
Young Master, we found it.

419
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,460
The Jiangtou weed originates
from the Western Regions.

420
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,120
It has never appeared
in the Central Plains before.

421
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,540
After a thorough investigation,

422
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,600
I discovered that nine years ago,

423
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,820
someone grew it in Xiushui City,

424
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
not far from here.

425
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,740
Xiushui City?

426
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,300
Could it be related to Xiushui?

427
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,780
Ride to Xiushui overnight.

428
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,140
If you find anything unusual,
report back immediately.

429
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,100
Yes.

430
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Young Master.

431
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,780
I've made up my mind.

432
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,300
This might be Suyu Pavilion's fate.

433
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
If we get through this,

434
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
I will tear that scoundrel apart

435
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,700
and strengthen our family's position.

436
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,220
If we don't,

437
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,500
and we face the City Lord's punishment,

438
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,980
I've arranged a carriage for you.

439
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,620
It contains enough gold and silver

440
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,780
for the rest of your life.

441
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,300
When the City Lord gives the order,

442
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,300
leave immediately and go as far as possible.

443
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,860
You're joking, Young Master.

444
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,260
How could I live dishonorably?

445
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,780
Besides,

446
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,060
my sister and you are involved.

447
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,500
How could I leave with a clear conscience?

448
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,980
You mean

449
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,020
your sister and I

450
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,620
are your concerns?

451
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,820
The Su family recognized my worth.

452
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,340
I dare not forget that.

453
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,380
Your words are enough for me.

454
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,060
Don't worry.

455
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,780
I will protect you.

456
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,180
(Yongyou Temple)

457
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
What's wrong?

458
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,500
Didn't I tell you not to bother me
unless it's urgent?

459
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,500
I just wanted to get rid of Shan Dandan.

460
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,540
But now, so many people are hurt in the city.

461
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,860
I'm too scared.

462
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,260
So you want to quit, right?

463
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,500
You know many things I've done.

464
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,780
It's not that easy to quit.

465
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
You can quit.

466
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,540
Anyway,

467
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,300
you're of no use to me now.

468
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,700
But only the dead can quit.

469
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,380
What are you doing?

470
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,940
(Mercy and Compassion)
Liu, are you alright?

471
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,340
Liu!

472
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,460
Come on.

473
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,940
There's no need to hide anymore.

474
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,380
Mr. Tan.

475
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,180
Stop pretending.

476
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,300
The scented jade originated with you.

477
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,860
It was all premeditated.

478
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,540
That day at the village woman's house,

479
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,020
we found clues about the seven-colored thread.

480
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,540
Only you could clean the thread shop
as you left early.

481
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,940
When we went to the Flower House,

482
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,780
you disappeared at once without a trace.

483
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Quick and clever.

484
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,140
You left us no evidence.

485
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,060
Each step

486
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,700
was guided by you in silence.

487
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,820
Unfortunately,

488
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,540
I specialize in dealing
with cunning people like you.

489
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,500
Tell me. What's your goal?

490
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,460
Your analysis is quite reasonable.

491
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,980
But you got one thing wrong.

492
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,260
You said you specialize
in dealing with people like me.

493
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,100
But you might have

494
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,780
overestimated yourself.

495
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,140
Pei Pei!

496
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,380
Pei Pei!

497
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,140
Let's go.

498
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,540
What are you doing here?

499
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Mr. Su found out this is related
to Xiushui City,

500
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,540
so we went to Pei's Mansion early
to discuss it with you.

501
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
We heard you were here.

502
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,460
We were worried, so we came to check.

503
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,580
Luckily, you were prepared.

504
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,940
I got Xiushui City. Remember that.

505
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,060
This scent is…

506
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,740
Indeed, you're deeply hidden.

507
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,620
I wasn't wrong.

508
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,620
Enough!

509
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,770
This...

510
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,700
It has come to this point.

511
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,460
Aren't you going to stop?

512
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,820
Or do you want me

513
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,700
to die in front of you too?

514
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,660
(Tan Qingbo, Xiushui City)

515
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,260
Isn't Mr. Tan the mysterious person?

516
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,380
I told you.

517
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
It's him, but not necessarily him.

518
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,620
How did you know?

519
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,540
You gave me the peach powder
Mr. Tan hated the most,

520
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,740
and you suddenly became ambitious.

521
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,500
Let alone the inadvertent calmness

522
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
and madness

523
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,580
you showed.

524
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,780
Actually, Young Master and I

525
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,940
have suspected you for a long time.

526
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,780
But it was just a guess.

527
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,260
Until you tried to drive a wedge
between Pei Pei and me,

528
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,300
revealing our past.

529
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,820
Your true intentions finally came out.

530
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,540
Thank you, Mr. Tan, for the opportunity.

531
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,300
But...

532
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,140
What's bothering you?

533
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,940
I'm still an unmarried woman.

534
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,500
About the stable hand...

535
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Don't worry.

536
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,300
I'll never mention it to anyone.

537
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,940
You should know me better.

538
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,860
Of course, I remember.

539
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,620
Mr. Tan,

540
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,240
is this a lady trouble

541
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,360
from your youthful indiscretions?

542
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,880
Is that why someone is smearing

543
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,060
the scented jade business?

544
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,580
Why are you smearing me?

545
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,340
I admit

546
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
you know Mr. Tan's past.

547
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,060
But the Mr. Tan I know

548
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,260
would never forget our agreement

549
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,060
for personal gain.

550
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,380
And

551
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,260
even if he had feelings for me,

552
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,620
he would respect and bless me.

553
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,860
Not like you,

554
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,540
using such crude methods.

555
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
Am I right?

556
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,700
His twin brother,

557
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,380
Tan Qingbo?

558
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,300
I underestimated you.

559
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Stop now.

560
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,740
After all you've done,

561
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,020
what have you gained?

562
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,580
I have my own pursuits and fate,

563
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,300
unlike you,

564
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,020
living dishonorably.

565
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,220
What is dishonorable?

566
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,100
Aren't you living dishonorably?

567
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,300
You're carefree now.

568
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,780
Or what? Like you?

569
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,260
Fleeing for my life?

570
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,300
It's you who's fleeing.

571
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,700
Don't forget.

572
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,100
You're the guard captain's son
of Xiushui City,

573
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,540
placed in Yuncui City as a spy.

574
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,260
Unexpectedly,

575
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,380
after all these years,

576
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,500
you'd betray your ancestors,

577
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,020
living like a lackey.

578
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,820
Do you still remember your hometown?

579
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Do you remember your parents?

580
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,460
When I was sent to Yuncui City,

581
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,100
I was just a ten-year-old child.

582
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
I knew nothing.

583
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,620
Who asked if I was willing?

584
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,060
Such a hometown

585
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,940
and such parents

586
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,860
are not worth remembering.

587
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,620
I have my own life now.

588
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,100
I won't get involved

589
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,500
in your conflicts.

590
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,060
Please leave.

591
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,940
You won't even

592
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,300
call me brother anymore?

593
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,820
Our Xiushui City has been oppressed
by Yuncui City for years.

594
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,500
Finally, we revived with scented jade.

595
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,780
But the Yuncui City Lord,

596
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,820
after hearing this,

597
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,300
rushed to develop the perfume market,

598
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,980
leaving us no way out.

599
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,980
We can't let his plan succeed.

600
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,380
What does that have to do with me now?

601
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,460
Tan Qinghe,

602
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,020
since it's like this,

603
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,540
don't blame me for being ruthless.

604
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,780
Unexpectedly,

605
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,780
you're from Xiushui City.

606
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,220
So, the investigation was correct.

607
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,060
You're the spy from Xiushui City.

608
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,500
At this point,

609
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,820
won't you surrender?

610
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,260
If you confess,

611
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,060
we might plead for you

612
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,580
before the City Lord.

613
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,660
I don't need

614
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,340
you nobodies to pity me.

615
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,500
Who lives or dies today

616
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,900
is still uncertain.

617
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,220
Enough.

618
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,740
If you insist on being stubborn,

619
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,100
let me be your first victim.

620
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,340
It's come to this.

621
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,780
Your tricks have been exposed.

622
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,940
Even if you kill them,

623
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,700
will the Yuncui City Lord let you go?

624
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,820
Who cares about our people?

625
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,620
Stop being stubborn.

626
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,500
I beg you.

627
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,660
Brother!

628
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,900
Hurry.

629
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Hurry.

630
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,060
- That way.
- This way.

631
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,220
Everyone has their own path,

632
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,780
like rivers and seas diverge.

633
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,540
It's a pity

634
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,700
I am not the winner here.

635
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,780
At this point,

636
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,500
I can't face

637
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,260
the captain and elders of Xiushui City.

638
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,340
No, brother!

639
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,820
How can you be so foolish?

640
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,900
Brother.

641
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,940
Brother.

642
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,140
When you're gone, I'll be all alone.

643
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,940
Please don't leave me.

644
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,500
Brother!

645
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,460
Brother!

646
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,340
(Pei's Mansion)

647
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,650
What are you thinking about?

648
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,060
It feels like the past few days

649
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,300
have been a dream.

650
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,060
The dream is over now.

651
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,020
And it was a good dream.

652
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,020
But for Mr. Tan,

653
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,820
it wasn't a good dream at all.

654
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,980
Both his own brother

655
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,420
and Cuiliu paid

656
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,660
for their sins.

657
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,060
It was some sort of justice.

658
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,220
I will visit Mr. Tan in a few days.

659
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,530
You won't be jealous, will you?

660
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,980
Maybe.

661
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,340
Young Master, Madam wants to see you.

662
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,620
- Come here.
- We've been waiting for you.

663
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,820
This time,

664
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,060
who would've thought

665
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,500
the people of Yuncui City were so united?

666
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,220
As soon as they heard the trouble

667
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,900
was caused by Xiushui City's schemes,

668
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,420
they rushed

669
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,020
to support our scented jade.

670
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,540
(Bright and Perfect)

671
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,180
All our efforts paid off.

672
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,140
I knew it.

673
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,100
You are a lucky star for our family.

674
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,660
Thanks to your investigation,

675
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,420
we cleared our name.

676
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,100
And the orders of your scented bracelets

677
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,060
have exceeded the loss
of the broken jade jewelry

678
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,020
by several times.

679
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,620
Now you don't have to ask for forgiveness.

680
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,460
Not only that,

681
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
the customers at Qipei Pavilion

682
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,260
far exceed those at Suyu Pavilion.

683
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,820
The City Lord even praised us,

684
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,460
saying our Qipei Pavilion not only runs well

685
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,180
but also solved the case,

686
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,020
and will be rewarded generously.

687
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,580
Rewarded?

688
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,140
What will the reward be?

689
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,580
You're too eager.

690
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,180
Yes.

691
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,060
It's almost dark.

692
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,620
The reward will have to come tomorrow.

693
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,820
Tomorrow?

694
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,140
That's too slow.

695
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,660
Then I must speed things up.

696
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,500
Come.

697
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,660
I've discussed it with Shopkeeper Hao.

698
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,220
From now on,

699
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,420
Dandan is the Deputy Shopkeeper
of Qipei Pavilion

700
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,940
and the Chief Jade Appraiser.

701
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,010
Your salary and bonus
will be five times higher,

702
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,340
with five days off every month.

703
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,260
No need for the days off.

704
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,220
No deductions.

705
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,740
Alright. That's great.

706
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,980
Thank you, Madam, for your trust.

707
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,380
I will work even harder.

708
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,180
Thank you, everyone.

709
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,380
Thank you.

710
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,660
Thank you.

711
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,420
- Great!
- Congratulations!

712
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,260
Now, let the Deputy Shopkeeper take over.

713
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,020
Thank you, Madam.

714
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,700
Let's go check the orders.

715
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,820
Alright, alright.

716
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,500
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

717
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,660
Take care.

718
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,660
Did you hear that?

719
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,340
I'm now the Deputy Shopkeeper

720
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,540
and the Chief Jade Appraiser of Qipei Pavilion.

721
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,060
My dream has finally come true.

722
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,620
I heard it.

723
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,740
Everyone heard it.

724
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,900
You look so happy.

725
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,220
But

726
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,380
it's nothing.

727
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,700
I've also prepared a reward.

728
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,060
A reward?

729
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,620
What is it?

730
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,900
You'll see. Come with me.

731
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,300
