(Candied Haw, Porcelain, Pastries)

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,210
I didn't expect

26
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,930
Yuncui City to have such an elegant place.

27
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,290
Elegance and romance aren't bound by location.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,560
The key is who you're with.

29
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm just a rough woman.

30
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,400
How can I afford the word "romance"?

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,450
Who dares say you're rough?

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,610
I'll take their life.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,520
You've worked hard these days.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,170
As a woman,

35
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,120
you've taken many risks.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,170
I didn't arrange things properly.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Young Master,

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,650
you've taken good care of me.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,170
Blossom Pastry.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
Makes you more beautiful and younger.

41
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,400
Isn't that the stall selling zenggao?

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,450
I remember you said you liked it.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Let's take a look.

44
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,890
Let's go.

45
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,450
Our candied haw is great!

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,330
Look at this. Isn't it big?

47
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,610
How is it?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,840
Thank you.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,960
Sweet and sour candied haw.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Miss, buy a stick of candied haw.

51
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,450
Our candied haw is sweet and sour.

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,640
Isn't it delicious?

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
It's delicious.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,610
Of course.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,210
Each piece is carefully selected,

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,610
perfectly sweet and sour.

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,330
We removed the seeds
and coated them with honey.

58
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,840
No ordinary stuff can compare.

59
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,170
Sir, how much?

60
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,240
Not expensive. Four taels of silver.

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,650
Four taels?

62
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,400
Sir, why don't you go and rob?

63
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,800
Four taels could buy this whole stall.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Here, sir.

65
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,090
Thank you, Young Master.

66
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,290
Let's go.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,120
Four taels.

68
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,520
Too expensive.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
Sour plum juice.

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,520
Top-grade iced sour plum juice.

71
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,890
Miss,

72
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,870
how about some sour plum juice?

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,050
Sweet and sour, it quenches thirst.

74
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,960
It's made from top-grade iced sour plums.

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
How much?

76
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,470
Two taels a cup.

77
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,610
Two taels?

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,050
That's cheap.

79
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,970
Thank you.

80
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,770
Let's go.

81
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,720
Sour plum juice!

82
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,400
May we find true love

83
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,840
and never be apart.

84
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,660
(May justice always prevail.)

85
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,180
(May justice always prevail.)

86
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,090
Do you feel

87
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,040
something is unfair?

88
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,930
Nothing.

89
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,130
I want to help you achieve all your wishes.

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,360
You've made your wish.

91
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,360
If you don't tell me, how can I help you?

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,650
There are too many unfair things in this world.

93
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,360
Too many wronged and harmed people.

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,720
I just hope

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,210
everyone can live happily with integrity.

96
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,650
As long as I'm here,

97
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,210
I won't let you experience

98
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,450
any injustice for even a moment.

99
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,330
As long as you trust me,

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,810
I'll protect you for life.

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,330
(Shan Shuangshuang,)

102
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
(what are you doing?)

103
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,920
(You're not sure if the person before you)

104
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,090
(is your father's killer yet.)

105
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,250
(How can you have feelings for him?)

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,360
I find you very boring.

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,520
I'm boring?

108
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,520
They ask for sky-high prices,
treating me like a fool.

109
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,960
Should I just give in to them?

110
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:18,970
The Bridge of Lost Dreams

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,480
is a high-end night market

112
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,520
formed by dozens of expensive shops.

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,130
Everything sold here

114
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
is of top quality.

115
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Isn't it normal for things to be a bit pricey?

116
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,250
Pricey?

117
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,570
I'm not a noble.

118
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Besides, if we spend the night here,

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,810
it'll cost me two months' living expenses.

120
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,090
You're really not romantic.

121
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,530
Alright.

122
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,520
We've toured the night market.

123
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,040
Where's my reward?

124
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,200
I took you here...

125
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,450
Is this night market

126
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,010
my reward?

127
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,210
I brought you here to buy
and eat whatever you want.

128
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,280
Isn't that a reward?

129
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,600
What kind of reward is that?

130
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,280
It's just wasting money.

131
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Then

132
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,010
what about the reward from my mother?

133
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,570
It's just a Deputy Shopkeeper.

134
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,770
I'm still the young master.

135
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm not as happy as you.

136
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,360
You were born a boss,

137
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
but I earned it with my own efforts.

138
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,880
I...

139
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,010
Do I really have no reward?

140
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,160
Think carefully.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
If not, I'll go to sleep.

142
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,610
There is.

143
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,120

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,500
(Qipei Pavilion)

173
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,740
(Ancient Jade Dealer)

174
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,090
Ancient Jade Dealer.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,810
The City Lord must mean my Qipei Pavilion

176
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,960
is renowned for both talent
and virtue through the ages.

177
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
If your father

178
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,880
saw the City Lord bestow such a title,

179
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,640
he could rest in peace.

180
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,890
Shopkeeper Hao,

181
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,530
arrange for someone to hang it up.

182
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,450
Put it down first.

183
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,210
Everyone, carry the boxes inside.

184
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,600
Careful.

185
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,440
It's really good.

186
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,010
I mean.

187
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,450
After the Jade Competition, we were criticized.

188
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,570
Our reputation was damaged.

189
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,930
This time, we've made a great comeback.

190
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,930
Right?

191
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,120
Let's have a big feast tonight

192
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,290
to reward everyone.

193
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Great.

194
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
What's wrong?

195
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,090
I was thinking.

196
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,050
Shuangshuang and the Su family helped us a lot.

197
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,810
Should we invite them too,

198
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,050
to show our gratitude?

199
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,530
This time we took the lead.

200
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,480
They're probably too angry

201
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,880
to come.

202
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,090
Dandan is right.

203
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,150
Whether they come or not is their business,

204
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,810
but inviting them shows our generosity.

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Young Master, what about your childhood?

206
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,210
My childhood was all about contests.

207
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Since I can remember,

208
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,090
I've always been compared to other kids.

209
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,760
If I failed

210
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,480
or slacked off even a little,

211
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,930
I faced mockery

212
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
and whipping.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,050
To be honest,

214
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
I understand Mr. Tan's brother.

215
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
When someone's stubbornness

216
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,410
and mission are in their bones,

217
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,210
no one can waver it.

218
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,410
I've never heard you talk about this.

219
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,000
What's the use of talking about it?

220
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,530
Life goes on.

221
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,530
Shuangshuang,

222
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
are you alright?

223
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,410
As long as you're okay,

224
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,290
everything's fine.

225
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,210
As long as you trust me,

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll protect you for life.

227
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,370
(No.)

228
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,050
(I can't go on like this.)

229
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,090
(If I'm blinded by romance,)

230
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,410
(I'll shame my father who died with regrets.)

231
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,530
(I must make a decision.)

232
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,480
Ms. Shan,

233
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,640
this is a letter from the Pei family.

234
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Thank you.

235
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,790
(To thank Mr. Su and Ms. Shuangshuang)

236
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,260
(for helping with the poisoned bracelet case,
please join us in our banquet.)

237
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,570
The gold and silver inlay.

238
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,170
Young Master.

239
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,640
Mr. Pei, you know about this technique?

240
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,840
It's the technique used on the Crown back then.

241
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
I have a little knowledge about it.

242
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,480
Mr. Pei.

243
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,840
I wonder what techniques
you will use this time.

244
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,170
Hollow vertical carving and filigree carving.

245
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,120
(Su Jue may be ambitious and domineering,)

246
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,960
(but after observing for a while,)

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,170
(he seems unaware of past events)

248
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,530
(and techniques.)

249
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,720
(But the more I look at Qipei Pavilion,)

250
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,410
(the more problems I see.)

251
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,410
(I need to speed up.)

252
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,530
This time we developed

253
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,840
and invested in the scented jade pieces,

254
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,290
and we risked our lives to solve the case.

255
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Just because the Pei family

256
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
held the last clue,

257
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,050
they get all the credit?

258
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,930
It's infuriating.

259
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,530
Exactly.

260
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,410
The scented bracelets are in high demand now.

261
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,240
We need to come up with a way to surpass them,

262
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,840
or we'll end up with nothing.

263
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,930
Understood.

264
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,930
Young Master.

265
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,250
Shopkeeper Wang.

266
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,760
Dandan sent someone to tell me

267
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,410
that our efforts were crucial

268
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,690
in solving the case.

269
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,640
They want to invite us to dinner

270
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,680
to show their gratitude.

271
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,410
Crocodile tears.

272
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,930
I'm not going.

273
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,210
Then I...

274
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,240
She's still your sister.

275
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,760
If you want to go, I won't stop you.

276
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,960
Thank you, Young Master.

277
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,930
That's it?

278
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,530
Can't you refuse?

279
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,130
The mist is poisonous.

280
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,010
You go first.

281
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,600
I entrust my daughter to you.

282
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,530
Jue,

283
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,840
there's something I must say.

284
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,090
I know you admire Ms. Shuangshuang,

285
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,480
but don't you find her too calm

286
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,720
and composed?

287
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,130
What do you mean?

288
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,410
Her sister is deeply rooted in the Pei family.

289
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,600
They interact frequently.

290
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,530
Since Ms. Shuangshuang came,

291
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,480
our intelligence has been lacking,

292
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,360
making it harder to deal with Qipei Pavilion.

293
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,090
We need to be cautious.

294
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,000
Impossible.

295
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,640
Shuangshuang developed the broken jade jewelry

296
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,570
and frustrated them,

297
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,480
putting the Pei family in a bind.

298
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,960
If she was with Qipei Pavilion,

299
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
why would she do that?

300
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,810
I hope I'm just overthinking.

301
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,120
You know her better than I do.

302
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,450
If even I suspect her,

303
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,570
don't you feel

304
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,640
something is off?

305
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,050
Thankfully, Ms. Shuangshuang saved us.

306
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,690
So,

307
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,840
we can test her.

308
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,690
I have a way.

309
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,700
(Peace and Tranquility)

310
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
To Ms. Shuangshuang.

311
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,570
Thank you for putting aside past grievances

312
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,930
and helping us greatly.

313
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,170
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

314
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,210
Ms. Shuangshuang, you are sensible

315
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,410
and skilled.

316
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,530
That's truly rare.

317
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,480
Indeed, my sister's gold and silver inlay

318
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,120
is exceptional.

319
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,170
Certainly.

320
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,330
I once had the pleasure of seeing that.

321
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,680
Ms. Shuangshuang's inlay

322
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,810
can even be compared to the Moonlight Crown.

323
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,640
Mr. Pei, you seem to know the Crown well.

324
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,850
To be honest,

325
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,840
in the Jade Competition,
the filigree carving on the jade fan

326
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,490
was inspired by the Crown.

327
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,440
You must have seen the Crown yourself.

328
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,530
I saw it once when I was young.

329
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,840
How did you learn

330
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,200
gold and silver inlay?

331
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,970
Also when I was young.

332
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,880
It's from a traveling artist.

333
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,250
Two artists.

334
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,600
Let's discuss another day.

335
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,970
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

336
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,570
Let's eat.

337
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,760
Let's eat.

338
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,360
Here, Dandan.

339
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,160
Thank you, Shuangshuang.

340
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,840
Shuangshuang,

341
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
I wish you could always be by my side.

342
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,810
Yes. If Ms. Shuangshuang

343
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,120
could join our Qipei Pavilion,

344
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,330
you can be with Dandan every day.

345
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,840
That would be perfect.

346
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,120
Shuangshuang, if you really join us,

347
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,680
my life would be complete.

348
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
Alright.

349
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,090
Really?

350
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,810
Boss Pei, when can my sister start?

351
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,050
You're already the Deputy Shopkeeper.

352
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,960
You

353
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,250
can decide that.

354
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,290
No time like the present.

355
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,330
She'll start from today.

356
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,400
Welcome our designer Shan Shuangshuang

357
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
to Qipei Pavilion!

358
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,160
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

359
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,490
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

360

364
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,680
Dad, what's wrong?

365
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,930
Dad.

366

Dad.

368
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,120
Dad, what's wrong?

369
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Shuangshuang, I was used.

370
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,250
The jewels on the Moonlight Crown

371
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,330
weren't medicine to save anyone.

372
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,880
I failed your mother,

373
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,530
and I failed you.

374
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,160
Dad, don't say that.

375
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,160
You've escaped successfully.

376
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,970
Who did this to you?

377
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,360
Who?

378
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,640
Silly child,

379
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,120
it was all my foolish mistakes.

380
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,160
Let's leave it at that.

Mom,

384

I'm here to see you.

Dad,

386
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,290
who tricked you

387
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,730
into stealing the Crown and losing your life?

388
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,400
Why couldn't you tell me?

389
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,400
(Father Shan Jingtian)
I've been in the Su family for years

390
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,400
but still hasn't found any clues.

391
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,330
Could it really be the Pei family's inside job,

392
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,400
using you for their gain?

393
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:37,930
Dad,

394
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,250
I'm useless.

395
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,200
I've developed feelings for a man

396
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
who might be an enemy.

397
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,160
But don't worry.

398
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
I will cut off these feelings

399
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,440
until the truth is revealed.

400

Young Master.

406
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,290
The Crown has been found.

407
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,410
Where?

408
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,300
In the depths of the forest,
near the Fatal Tomb.

409
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,730
The jade key to the tomb is nearby,

410
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
but we haven't found it yet.

411
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,490
Is the information reliable?

412
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,160
The source has been hiding for years for this.

413
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,090
It's absolutely reliable.

414
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,640
Good. Find the jade key quickly.

415
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,840
Once found, we can enter the tomb
and retrieve the treasure.

416
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,930
Understood.

00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,490
I'll take my leave.

go get me an abacus.

Thank you.

Off you go now.

431
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,130
Alright.

432
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,130
What?

433
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,000
Immature.

434
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,680
Are you comfortable
being the Deputy Shopkeeper?

435
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,160
Are you mocking me?

436
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,010
How dare I mock the Deputy Shopkeeper?

437
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,970
That's more like it.

438
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,530
As the Deputy Shopkeeper,

439
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,810
it's only right to have some servants

440
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,010
do the chores for you.

441
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,530
Don't be afraid.

442
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,730
Don't worry. I'm here.

443
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,010
Or maybe,

444
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,440
you're working so hard

445
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,840
on everything

446
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,600
because you're afraid someone

447
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,880
will replace you one day?

448
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,570
Do you really think

449
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,290
I'm so easily replaced?

450
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
No, I...

451
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,330
Speak.

452
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,050
Do you have someone else?

453
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,810
I mean...

454
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,730
You're stammering. I knew it.

455
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,730
You men

456
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,010
are all the same.

457
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,370
No, Dandan, I...

458
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,230
No what?

459
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,650
Ms. Dandan.

460
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,250
Mr. Su, why are you here?

461
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,090
Where's my sister?

462
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm here to see you.

463
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,880
May I have a word with you?

464
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Alright.

465
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,330
Please enjoy.

466
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,250
Mr. Su, what brings you here today?

467
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,490
We've been through tough times together.

468
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
No need to be formal.

469
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,640
Ms. Dandan, you're straightforward,

470
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
so I'll be direct.

471
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm here for Shuangshuang.

472
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,760
My sister?

473
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,890
To be honest,

474
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,730
I've admired her for a long time,

475
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,050
and I've secretly promised

476
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,640
to give her the best life.

477
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,570
I can tell.

478
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,250
But feelings can't be forced.

479
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,770
I can't help you with that.

480
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,400
It's up to her.

481
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,840
Ms. Dandan, you've misunderstood.

482
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,810
I don't want you to help me win her over.

483
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,290
It's just that Shuangshuang
doesn't go out much.

484
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,400
She is quiet and composed,

485
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,640
so I don't know much about her.

486
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,600
I want to know more

487
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,120
to take better care of her.

488
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,290
I know as much about my sister as you do.

489
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
How is that possible?

490
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,200
You grew up together.

491
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,530
You should know much more.

492
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,530
Since I was born,

493
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
I've never seen my parents.

494
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,810
My sister worked outside,

495
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,530
and I stayed home,

496
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,640
so we didn't spend

497
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,970
much time together.

498
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,330
Are you saying

499
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,490
you don't know what she does outside?

500
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
No.

501
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,360
That day, she was amazing
at bloodletting and detoxification.

502
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,490
Has she studied medicine or martial arts?

503
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,720
I don't know.

504
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,330
But my sister is usually gentle

505
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,840
and just makes jewelry.

506
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,090
She can't possibly know about fighting.

507
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,330
She's taken care of you for years,

508
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,120
and you're close in age.

509
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,730
Don't you find it strange

510
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,810
that she navigates the world so well?

511
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,050
Hearing you say this,

512
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,160
my sister really is amazing.

513
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,680
I'll definitely pay more attention to her.

514
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,840
(Is it that Dandan only knows a little)

515
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,360
(about Shuangshuang,)

516
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,680
(or is she wary of me?)

517
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,530
(Or am I just overthinking?)

518
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,250
Why are you here?

519
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,530
To take you home.

520
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,770
What did he want?

521
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,330
He wanted to know about my sister.

522
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,090
Aren't they together

523
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,090
every day?

524
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,290
Why does he need to ask you?

525
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,570
He likes my sister.

526
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,440
It's normal for him to ask.

527
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,400
He likes her?

528
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,290
How come I didn't know?

529
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,160
He likes my sister.

530
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,970
Should you know?

531
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,330
You have a point.

532
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,970
Young Master! Young Master!

533
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,360
Young Master! Young Master!

534
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,360
What's the matter? Why are you in such a rush?

535
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,810
Young Master, I got news about the Crown.

536
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,850
The Moonlight Crown.

537
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,610
What?

538
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,010
Don't joke with me.

539
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,400
Don't overestimate me.

540
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,880
Do you think I'd joke about this?

541
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,880
Sun Wu. It's Sun Wu.

542
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,530
Sun Wu? Who's that?

543
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,880
Sun Wu is a master
of gold and silver soldering.

544
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,640
He did the soldering

545
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,920
on the Crown.

546
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,360
His status back then was on par with my father.

547
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,370
Yes.

548
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,650
This time,

549
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
an old friend of mine

550
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,050
accidentally met Sun Wu's apprentice.

551
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,810
Since Master Sun lived in seclusion,

552
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,440
he only took on one apprentice.

553
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,010
The apprentice revealed
the location of the Crown.

554
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,920
Let's return to the mansion first.

555
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,130
Alright.

556
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,920
Let's go.

557
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,680
Fool.

558
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,840
Since we're putting on a show,

559
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,360
let's make it a full one.

560
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,090
With the appearance of the Crown,

561
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,250
Qipei Pavilion will surely make a move.

562
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,530
Then we can catch them

563
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,050
red-handed,

564
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,680
solidifying their previous crimes

565
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,120
of embezzlement.

566
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Killing two birds with one stone.

567
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,180
(Peace and Tranquility)

568
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,880
How did he know where the Crown was hidden?

569
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,200
Who hid it away?

570
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
How would I know?

571
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,480
I...

572
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,520
Come on.

573
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,290
Couldn't you get every little detail?

574
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,370
No.

575
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,200
I'm innocent.

576
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,250
His apprentice is timid

577
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,400
and cautious.

578
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,160
He only revealed it after drinking too much

579
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,680
with my old friend.

580
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,540
If we keep asking,

581
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
he might not even know himself.

582
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,600
He doesn't know

583
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,570
where the jade key is either.

584
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,660
I think he probably

585
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,600
heard it from someone else.

586
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,930
Heard it?

587
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,060
I...

588
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,160
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

589
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,120
When I heard the news,
I went to find him overnight,

590
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,730
but he had already moved.

591
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,290
Could this be a trap?

592
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,330
Master Sun Wu was involved in that incident.

593
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,570
It's possible

594
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,880
that his apprentice

595
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,360
might know the truth.

596
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,600
But unfortunately, after the incident,

597
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,810
Master Sun Wu retired

598
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,010
and disappeared.

599
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,530
Do you want to find the Crown?

600
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,810
When the Crown was lost,

601
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,360
everyone thought it was our inside job

602
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,770
to monopolize the skills
and treasures of various families.

603
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,490
My father became timid

604
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,570
and wouldn't let me touch the jade business.

605
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,970
If we can uncover the truth,

606
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,440
we can clear

607
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,730
the Pei family's name.

608
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,770
Even if it's a trap,

609
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,840
I must get to the bottom of it tonight.

610
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,730
If you're going,

611
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,120
we'll go with you.

612
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,090
Here.

613
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,240
Here.

614
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,600
One, two, three.

615
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,010
We can do this!

616
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,530
Close the doors and windows to prevent theft.

617
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,330
Close the doors and windows to prevent theft.

618
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,810
Have you hidden the jade key?

619
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,490
Right at the cave entrance.

620
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,600
It will be easy to find.

621
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,010
This is called "willing prey takes the bait".

622
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,010
It's been a while. Why hasn't anyone come yet?

623
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,960
Why are you here?

624
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,680
Weren't you supposed
to be watching Shuangshuang?

625
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,880
Young Master, Ms. Shuangshuang
is going out to buy materials.

626
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,730
I feared causing suspicion,
so I didn't stop her.

627
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,010
At this hour?

628
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,040
Forget it.

629
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,050
Our task isn't to keep her confined.

630
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,730
If she shows up here,

631
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,440
we can catch her red-handed.

632
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,680
Someone's coming.

633
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Shuangshuang.

634
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,810
Release the arrows!

635
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:40,920
Uncle, what are you doing?

636
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,490
I'm doing this for your own good, Jue.

637
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,440
Stop. Careful, Young Master!

638
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,370
Jue!

639
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,370
Quick!

640
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,730
- Jue, Jue.
- Young Master, are you alright?

641
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
How could you be so foolish?

642
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Spare me.

643
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm just a mountain bandit.

644
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,530
I heard rumors of treasure here,

645
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,400
so I came looking.

646
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,480
I don't want it anymore,

647
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,570
- I don't want anything.
- It's not her.

648
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,200
It's not her.

649
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,570
The arrow is poisoned!

650
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,530
Take the young master back now.

651
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,160
Get a doctor.

652
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,490
You stay here and wait for the Pei family.

653
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,930
Yes.

654
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,970
So it was you.

655
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,250
And what if it is?

656
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,840
Only you know.

657
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,600
If I move this sword slightly,

658
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,240
no one will know.

659
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,370
You...

660
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,240
Su Jue went to great lengths
to create this story

661
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,280
just to force me to show up.

662
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,680
That must be hard for him.

663
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,730
I'm outmatched.

664
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,090
Do whatever you want.

665
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,160
Really?

666
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,410
You won't kill me?

667
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,930
Why kill you?

668
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,930
You're not a bad person.

669
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,930
Aren't you afraid I'll tell the young master?

670
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,410
I'll kill you then

671
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,570
and your entire family.

672
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,690
Fine.

673
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,050
I won't hide it from you anymore.

674
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,010
I have my reasons for entering
the Su's Mansion to find the Crown.

675
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
But I don't seek wealth or kill.

676
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
As long as the Su family
doesn't act too wickedly,

677
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,530
I won't harm them.

678
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,450
As for you,

679
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,720
over the years,

680
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,200
has Su Jue ever treated you like a human being?

681
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
If you keep today's events to yourself,

682
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,010
your family will be safe.

683
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,120
But if you oppose me

684
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,570
and risk your family's life
to work for the Su family,

685
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,890
I can't help you.

686
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,530
Thank you for sparing my life.

687
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,280
We're all from poor families.

688
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,320
No need for that.

689
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,570
Ms. Shuangshuang,

690
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,160
besides deceiving you,

691
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,460
they also gave false information
to the Pei family,

692
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,320
trying to frame them for hiding the Crown.

693
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,320
Go save your sister quickly.

694
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,460
The Pei family got the jade mine

695
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,930
in the western mountain
of the suburbs first.

696
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,770
Loser!

697
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,570
This darn Pei family.

698
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,770
You bootlicker.

699
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,770
Are you even human?

700
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,490
Don't be ungrateful. I'm telling you.

701
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,970
Who are you

702
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,320
to call me a bootlicker?

703
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,490
What am I?

704
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,120
Our young master calls me his brother

705
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,720
in front of everyone he meets.

706
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:17,970
What about you?

707
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,000
Let's go.

708
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,850
It's late. No one else will come.

709
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,680
- Let's report back.
- Yes.

710
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,410
We've been walking all night.

711
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,760
Why aren't we there yet?

712
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,970
Hang in there.

713
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,290
We should be close.

714
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,720
Everything looks the same.

715
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,320
It feels like we've passed this place before.

716
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,680
The paths are tough to walk here.

717
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,930
Yes.

718
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,970
Be careful, Dandan.

719
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,010
Look ahead.

720
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,010
Do you smell that?

721
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,490
What is it? It smells so good.

722
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,000
This is...

723
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,760
It does smell good.
