23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,660
Mr. Pei.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,940
You don't have to rush over.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,140
You know

26
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,300
I will wait for you.

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,660
How can that be possible?

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,420
I'm a man of my word.

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,300
Even a moment's delay is not acceptable.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,180
Mr. Pei.

31
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,620
Don't worry.

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,620
I will definitely persuade Madam Yang,

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,060
and be the Jade Beauty

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,620
for Qipei Pavilion.

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,780
I heard the portrait for the competition

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,820
has been delivered today.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,460
Portrait?

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,940
The painter came a few days ago.

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,580
It shouldn't be so soon.

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
No?

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,940
How do you know about the portrait?

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,220
Tell me.

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,460
Who did you just go to?

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,240
You tell me.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,260
- Who did you go to?
- Don't, don't, don't.

46
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,460
- Hold on, I...
- Tell me.

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,540
Who did you go to?

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,860
Ms. Huadian.

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,340
Dandan.

50
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,940
Your portrait is here.

51
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,460
The painting looks really nice.

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,340
(Little trickster.)

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,540
(Playboy.)

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,060
Mr. Pei, look.

55
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,580
What do you think of this painting?

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
Do you like it?

57
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,740
Yeah.

58
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,940
Mr. Pei, do you think she looks better

59
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,620
than in the painting?

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,380
Yeah, tell me.
Do I look better in person?

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,220
Say it.

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,060
Both is good.

63
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,500
I think this painting,

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,740
one shade the more,

65
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,460
one ray the less.

66
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,820
It's just perfect.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,640
There is absolutely no need f
or any modifications.

68
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,460
(Don't push your luck.)

69
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,220
(Wanting to help
that ugly painter make money?)

70
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,340
(In your dreams.)

71
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,100
No need to modify indeed.

72
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,740
The main thing is

73
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,260
my Mr. Tan

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,300
doesn't have time to repaint it.

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,220
After all, Lingyuan is taking
too much of his time.

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,660
What? Lingyuan
wants to change the painting?

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,580
You don't know, Ms. Huadian.

78
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
When I went to Lingyuan's room just now,

79
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,780
she happened to have a guest there.

80
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,980
That guest

81
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,380
was so nice to Ms. Lingyuan.

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,740
He was carefully telling her there

83
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,900
what needed to be modified.

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,140
Right, Mr. Pei?

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,380
Lingyuan is ugly.

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,100
Of course, she needs to modity more.

87
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,740
Mr. Pei said

88
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,420
my painting doesn't need to be modified.

89
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,820
Right, Mr. Pei?

90
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,180
Then modify it.

91
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,100
Since she modified it,
we should do the same.

92
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,060
But the time is...

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Liu.

94
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
Young Master, I'm here.

95
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,100
Young Master.

96
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,020
Lingyuan's guest

97
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,940
specifically instructed me

98
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,660
to make Lingyuan's portrait

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,020
look so beautiful.

100
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,220
How about this?

101
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,500
Let's call Lingyuan over

102
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,100
and discuss together

103
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,220
how to allocate the time reasonably.

104
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,900
Do you have time to make the change now?

105
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,380
Yes, of course.

106
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,380
Tell me,
how do you want to modify it, Mr. Pei?

107
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,660
No need for major changes.

108
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,620
Just make the color a little brighter.

109
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,780
That's definitely not a problem.

110
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,940
Just now, Lingyuan's guest

111
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,900
looked chubby with big ears

112
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,020
and a heavy, brutal-looking face.

113
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,060
His taste is definitely

114
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,980
not as good as Mr. Pei's.

115
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,740
Is it true, Mr. Pei?

116
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,620
Of course.

117
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,980
(Flower Pavilion)

118
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,020
Ms. Dandan,

119
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,940
don't be mad at Young Master.

120
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,140
He did nothing wrong.

121
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,660
He just wants to find the Jade Beauty.

122
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,700
He asked me to do it.

123
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,380
You know very well who I am.

124
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,780
- Anyway, Young Master...
- Shut up.

125
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,700
What are you looking at?

126
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,620
You are already a member
of the Qipei Pavilion now.

127
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,340
Why are you still doing these errands?

128
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,500
You will embarrass us.

129
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,460
I didn't delay your work.

130
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,460
What's wrong with me
earning some extra money in my own time?

131
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,500
And you,

132
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,580
you said to focus on the carving.

133
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,380
Now you're here
flirting with girls in this place.

134
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,500
And two girls at once.

135
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,660
I'm there for work.

136
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,780
I came to persuade them

137
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,340
to be our Jade Beauty.

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,180
I came specifically for the competition.

139
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,020
Bah!

140
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,260
You're just trying

141
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
to have some fun here.

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,780
You are shameless.

143
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
You hit on your former boss

144
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,580
and make dirty money.

145
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,540
You are vulgar.

146
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,980
You said I am vulgar?

147
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,900
(Flower Pavilion)

148
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,220
Who is bullying my Mr. Pei?

149
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,060
Your Mr. Pei?

150
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,140
Cheater! Hit him!

151
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,620
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

152
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,790
Don't touch me.

153
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,340
(Flower Pavilion)

154
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,500
(Add the crista)

155
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,180
15 centimeters long Linglong jade

156
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
with silver-plated edge.

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,780
Interesting.

158
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
My man

159
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,980
took it from Pei Pei's room.

160
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,940
Can't be wrong.

161
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
Uncle.

162
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,780
Make the same Linglong jade

163
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,220
according to this drawing

164
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,660
and send it to City Lord's residence.

165
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,340
Just say it's a gift from Suyu Pavilion.

166
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,620
The person suspected of plagiarism

167
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,180
not only can't win the competition,

168
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,140
but also will be condemned.

169
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,740
Understood.

170
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,020
I understood.

171
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,460
Jue, you finally came around.

172
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,500
No longer the innocent young man
as you used to be.

173
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,780
Good.

174
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,300
Uncle.

175
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,300
What do you think of Ms. Shuangshuang?

176
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,420
Ms. Shuangshuang is...

177
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,460
Gentle, quiet, and graceful.

178
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,180
And she's skillful.

179
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,780
Both talented and gifted.

180
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,740
Uncle, to be honest,

181
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,140
this pair of mandarin ducks

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,180
is the betrothal gift I prepared for her.

183
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,820
So it must be a champion work.

184
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,020
Precautions averts perils.

185
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,420
That's great.

186
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,590
- You go first.
- You go first.

187
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
Okay.

188
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,830
Even if you did it for the Jade Beauty,

189
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,920
is there

190
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,600
no other way?

191
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
You are a decent man.

192
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,720
How could you seduce the girls?

193
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
What are you up to?

194
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,660
Then what's your solution?

195
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,740
Give them money

196
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,700
or force them to come with a knife?

197
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,100
Also,

198
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,180
I've already paid your wages.

199
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,460
Yet you're still helping others.

200
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,900
Are you insatiable

201
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,780
or are you doing it for your old lover?

202
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,420
I'm not doing it for money.

203
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,560
Then what for?

204
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
For love?

205
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,060
Or

206
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,260
you are jealous,

207
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,900
so you ruined my date
with other women on purpose?

208
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,140
Say it.

209
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,900
Yes, I'm jealous.

210
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,020
I just hate seeing you with other women.

211
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,300
I hate your inconsistency.

212
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,420
I hate the way you play tricks.

213
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,380
I hate it that you kissed me

214
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,900
and then pretend like nothing happened.

215
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,220
I got it.

216
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,380
I was just being delusional.

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,860
This time, we can forget about the girls

239
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
in Flower Pavilion.

240
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,940
But we must figure out a solution.

241
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,700
We need a girl with good looks

242
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,220
and fame.

243
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,020
Where can we find such a person?

244
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,580
Young Master.

245
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,940
Are you listening?

246
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm listening, go on.

247
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,660
The Jade Beauty is crucial.

248
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,980
Think about those judges
in previous years.

249
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,860
Many times, they weren't really judging
based on the jade itself,

250
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,340
but the beauty.

251
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,300
Ms. Dandan.

252
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Are you listening?

253
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,260
You two are so in sync with each other.

254
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,620
Why not just get married?

255
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

256
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,940
Young Master, Dandan.

257
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,300
What's going on with you two?

258
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,500
Ever since the negotiation
during the day,

259
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,740
it's like you've lost your soul.

260
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,340
The Jade Competition is still about jade.

261
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,140
I didn't expect the display
of the Jade Beauty

262
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,420
to be so important.

263
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,740
In previous competitions,

264
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
there were jade hairpins
and jade ornaments

265
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,300
used as accessories for static display.

266
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,860
Some used jade discs as props to dance,

267
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,540
while others use jade flutes and pipes
to play music.

268
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,460
In short, they came up with many plans.

269
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,940
Every time,

270
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,140
the judges

271
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,060
would carefully watch the display
of the Jade Beauty,

272
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,500
so we must take it seriously.

273
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,940
However, come to think of it,

274
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,020
I can use jade hairpins and rings

275
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,140
for static display.

276
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,900
What's with that expression?

277
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,220
I tell you,

278
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,380
I am a pretty girl
from the Shiduizi Hutong

279
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,180
of West Market District in Yuncui City.

280
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,980
It's not that you are not good-looking.

281
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,660
But girls like Lingyuan

282
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
are famous

283
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,420
not only in our Yuncui City,

284
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,580
but also in the surrounding areas.

285
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,260
Many people came here out of admiration.

286
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,540
The more people watch them,

287
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,300
the more points we will gain.

288
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,980
They have a large number of views.

289
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,180
Let's just call them traffic.

290
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,140
Having traffic is good,

291
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,820
but strength is also
very important, right?

292
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Dandan makes sense.

293
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,020
It's the most important to showcase

294
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,980
our jade artifacts.

295
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Do you know Hongyan

296
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,980
from Flower Pavilion?

297
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,180
Although she may not be
outstanding in appearance,

298
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,660
and not very famous,

299
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,140
her dancing is truly amazing.

300
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,340
She and Huadian used to be my shill.

301
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,820
So I know them.

302
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,620
I think we can give it a try.

303
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,020
What?

304
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,620
Let me be the Jade Beauty?

305
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,060
That's right.

306
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,820
Although I have already reserved

307
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,160
all the popular girls of Flower Pavilion,

308
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,300
after many thoughts,

309
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,060
I feel that they are not
half as good as you.

310
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,060
Mr. Su, you flatter me.

311
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,460
I am just an ordinary girl.

312
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,180
There's nothing remarkable about me.

313
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,180
Nonsense.

314
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,300
You are extraordinary.

315
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,460
In my heart,

316
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,260
you are the most beautiful woman
in the world.

317
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,660
But

318
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,740
I don't know anything.

319
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,660
You don't need to do anything.

320
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,220
This jade mandarin duck
is made just for you.

321
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,340
You just need to hold it quietly

322
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,380
and appreciate it.

323
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,780
That's enough.

324
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,660
Just do me a favor.

325
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,700
You're back.

326
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,860
Sorry, Dandan.

327
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
I did six dances, so I came late.

328
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,340
Hurry, sit down.

329
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,020
We have something to ask of you.

330
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,380
It's only natural for us to wait.

331
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,500
Ask me?

332
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,380
We would like to ask you

333
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,220
to be the Jade Beauty
of our Qipei Pavilion.

334
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,260
What? You don't want to?

335
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,780
No.

336
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,060
No shops have

337
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,260
asked me to be their Jade Beauty.

338
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,900
That's because they had no taste.

339
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,100
Think about it.

340
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,360
No one here dances
better than you, right?

341
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,020
You're what we came for.

342
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,580
Please do us the honor, Ms. Hongyan.

343
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,700
I'm sure you'll be well-treated.

344
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,100
As long as you don't mind, I'm willing.

345
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,940
Great.

346
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,340
We're preparing the Linglong jade.

347
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,660
Do you have any thoughts?

348
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,660
Linglong jade?

349
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,140
What a beautiful dance.

350
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,340
Mr. Pei.

351
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,180
This Linglong jade

352
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,500
is hard to integrate with dance.

353
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,380
I can only try my best to show it.

354
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,900
It's probably difficult
to achieve perfect harmony.

355
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,700
We definitely can't change the jade item.

356
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,930
This jade is very important
to our Young Master.

357
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,460
- So can you...
- No problem.

358
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,460
I can change.

359
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,380
- But...
- It's okay.

360
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,260
I am already an adult.

361
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,980
These sentiments
cannot fill my stomach.

362
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,140
And there'll be plenty of opportunities
to make up for it.

363
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,340
Ms. Hongyan.

364
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,340
What kind of jade item
is suitable for your dance?

365
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,340
Drum, fan, flute.

366
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,380
All are suitable.

367
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,500
Okay.

368
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,780
I'll make a jade fan for you

369
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,700
as soon as possible.

370
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,380
You really want to make a jade fan?

371
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,020
The carving technique of the jade fan

372
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,580
is similar to the previous one,

373
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,420
and the requirements are more refined.

374
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,020
It's also a good choice.

375
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,220
What about the thing happened before?

376
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,620
You've let go?

377
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,860
I can't.

378
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,140
However,

379
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,180
there's no need to let go.

380
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,020
There are some things

381
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,060
that I'll never forget in my whole life.

382
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,820
But there's no need
to force yourself to forget.

383
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,220
Just let it quietly stay there.

384
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,740
After all, the future road
is wider and longer.

385
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,300
And

386
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
now that I have you,

387
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,740
I will strive to live better.

388
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,620
That's great.

389
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,820
Just this?

390
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,660
Otherwise?

391
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,540
Maybe I need a kiss.

(Jade Competition)

401
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,260
Your hair is so dry.

402
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,500
You can't even smooth it.

403
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
The powder is so thick.

404
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,300
Can't cover your face
even with three layers.

405
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,220
Young Master.

406
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,260
What are you staring at?

407
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,140
You're beautiful.

408
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,900
Is it a bit too much?

409
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,940
Anyone will look beautiful
with makeup, alright?

410
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,460
I already said I don't need it.

411
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,940
Why do you insist on me
putting on these?

412
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,580
How can you face people without makeup?

413
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,180
It's the first formal debut

414
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,740
of the jade appraiser
from our Qipei Pavilion.

415
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,380
Can't let others outshine you.

416
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,220
Don't worry,
she will definitely be outshone.

417
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,460
That won't happen.

418
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,820
So confident.

419
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,060
The other jade appraisers are all men.

420
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,460
Who can be prettier than me?

421
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
We've prepared for so long.

422
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,220
It's time to let the world
know our strength.

423
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,180
We must win

424
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,500
this battle.

425
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,100
Come on.

426
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,660
Come on.

427
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,180
Come on.

428
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,900
How about it?

429
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,020
She's not here?

430
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,420
Why is she standing us up at this time?

431
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,580
Is she trying to destroy us?

432
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,780
Otherwise, I'll go look again.

433
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,980
I've searched everywhere. It's no use.

434
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,340
In the worst case,

435
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,820
we can cancel this Jade Beauty.

436
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,900
How can that be possible?

437
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
Our jade fan is a pure dynamic ornament.

438
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,340
How can we display it
without the Jade Beauty?

439
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,700
It's all my fault.

440
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,540
I came up with a bad idea!

441
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,080
Otherwise, these things
wouldn't have happened.

442
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,180
Don't worry about these things.

443
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,900
Let's focus on
finding a solution for now.

444
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,900
But City Lord is coming soon.

445
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,660
We definitely won't make it in time.

446
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,260
Right.

447
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,300
The first time I met you,

448
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,420
it was at Flower Pavilion.

449
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,180
At that time, your appearance

450
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,780
almost fooled me.

451
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
How about

452
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
you do it yourself?

453
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,740
Me?

454
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,980
You know my dancing.

455
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,900
No, no.

456
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,900
That's better than nothing.

457
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,100
I think Young Master is right.

458
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,380
We should make every possible effort.

459
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,940
We don't have any other
options right now.

460
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,980
Give it a try.

461
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,700
But...

462
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,140
I'll go get dressed up.

463
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,020
Young Master.

464
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,380
It seems to be a girl
from Flower Pavilion.

465
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,060
She should be the Jade Beauty
the Pei family found.

466
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,780
The girl looks ordinary

467
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,780
and is not very famous.

468
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,700
She is not well-received
at Flower Pavilion.

469
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,220
Since she's so miserable,

470
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,860
we can make things worse.

471
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
You mean...

472
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,340
Go find Madam Yang.

473
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,020
The Su family doesnt want these girls,

474
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,260
nor can others have them.

475
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,580
Yes.

476
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,450
Wait.

477
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Tell Madam Yang

478
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,540
during regular training sessions,

479
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,940
she can participate.

480
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,540
Just make her disappear
on the day of the competition.

481
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,860
Understood.

482
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,140
City Lord is here.

483
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,180

Good!

488
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,740
Your Lordship, thank you very much

489
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,740
for appointing the Flower Pavilion
to host this Jade Competition.

490
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,900
We extend our welcome
to all the celebrities present.

491
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,380
Good!

492
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,220
Bravo!

493
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,020
After the selection of carvings, samples,

494
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,420
and jade quality,

495
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,500
His Lordship and the judges

496
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,260
selected four stores to enter the finals.

497
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,820
They are

498
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,220
Suyu Pavilion,

499
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,060
Good!

500
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,820

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,140
Good!

and Xiangyu Hall.

505

Good!

506

After all the jade items
are exhibited today,

507
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,020
the judges will select the champion.

508
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,900
Now, let's welcome His Lordship
to the stage.

509
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,780
Bravo!

510
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,220
You have said everything.

511
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,460
What am I supposed to say?

512
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,740
Let's get started.

513
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,700
Okay, okay, okay.

514
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,180
Now, I announce

515
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,860
the 12th Jade Competition of Yuncui City

516
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,940
officially begins.

517
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Good!

518
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,260
The first competitor
is Linglong Pavilion.

519
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,780
Let's give a round of applause to them.

520
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,060
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

521
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,660
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

522
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,740
Didn't Suyu Pavilion

523
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,500
reserve all the girls
from Flower Pavilion?

524
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,820
This jade instrument

525
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,260
is made of top quality Hetian jade.

526
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Polished by craftsmen several times,

527
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,540
combined with the performance of

528
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,580
the famous beauty, Ms. Huadian,

529
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,620
it's simply amazing.

530
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,540
Let's give her a round of applause.

531
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,080
- Good!
- Good!

532
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,780
Is this too tight?

533
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,780
You don't understand.

534
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,220
This shows your waistline.

535
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,500
Good!

536
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,420
Good!

537
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,580
Good!

538
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,300
Your Lordship.

539
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,820
How do you feel
about this jade instrument?

540
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,420
This jade piece is quite large.

541
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,460
Poorly-made.

542
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,940
Next, please welcome Xiangyu Hall.

543
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,260
Good!

544
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
This jade sword is selected from
the top-grade jade produced in Kunshan.

545
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,600
The sword body is intact
without any breakage.

546
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,420
It's over two feet long,

547
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,500
having a heroic and imposing appearance.

548
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,860
Let's applaud!

549
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,620
- Bravo!
- Good!

550
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,500
- Bravo!
- Good!

551
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,460
The carving is exquisite.

552
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,580
- Bravo!
- Good!

553
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,620
The next one is Suyu Pavilion.

554
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,220
- Bravo!
- Good!

555
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,240
Suyu Pavilion is about
to make an appearance.

556
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,660
That's Suyu Pavilion, isn't it?

557
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,780
Look at this.

558
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,900
It's so beautiful

559
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,140
The real deal

560
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,460
doesn't need those fancy gimmicks.

561
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,980
Everyone says that the word "bright"

562
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,740
is used to describe the moon,

563
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,300
but I feel that

564
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,300
it's more suitable to describe a beauty

565
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,900
or a piece of fine jade.

566
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,860
This pair of mandarin ducks

567
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,060
are made of the rare ice type
that appears once in a thousand years.

568
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,180
I used more than twenty skills
unique to Suyu Pavilion.

569
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,580
I remember my sweetheart told me before

570
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,420
that a pair of mandarin ducks
without eyes

571
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,740
cannot see each other's faces,

572
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,180
let alone those

573
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,780
superficial appearances.

574
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,620
But they can still

575
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,140
stay closely together,

576
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,940
that's what true love means.

577
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,820
Bravo!

578
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,780
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

579
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,580
Bravo!

580
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,940
What a beautiful description.

581
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,230
Looks like this year's champion

582
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,180
will go to the Su family again.

583
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,660
- Good!
- Good!

584
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,660
- Good!
- Good!

585
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,700
The last one to appear is Qipei Pavilion.

586
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,700
- Good!
- Good!

587
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
It's so beautiful.

588
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,500
Look at yourself.

589
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
Exquisite,

590
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,540
well-proportioned,

591
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,660
and delicate.

592
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,900
Is that so?

593
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,860
You will be the Jade Beauty.

594
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,380
What?

595
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Are you kidding me?

596
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,580
Don't be silly.

597
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,340
I'm not joking around.

598
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,260
The other Jade Beauties are all women.

599
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,860
But we will take on a different path

600
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,300
and catch them off guard.

601
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,100
No.

602
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,980
Yes.

603
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,940
Impossible.

604
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
Possible.

605
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,940
I disagree.

606
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,220
Please.

607
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,900
Please, please.

608
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,820
Well...

609
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,090
Since you have done so much for me,

610
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,620
I will reluctantly

611
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,660
agree to help you.

612
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,700
You are so kind.

613
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,020
Let's do makeup.

614
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,460
So beautiful.

615
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,020
How come I haven't seen her before?

616
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,900
When did this girl
come to Flower Pavilion?

617
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
I have never seen her before.

618
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,820
So stunningly beautiful!

619
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,180
She is truly captivating.

620
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,380
Yes.

621
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,700
This is a silver and jade fan
presented by Qipei Pavilion.

622
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,260
The fan surface is thin as cicada wings.

623
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
Decorated with reliefs

624
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
and cutouts.

625
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,300
The fan blades are connected
by extremely fine silver threads.

626
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,100
The carving technique
at the fan's handle

627
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,700
is also exquisite,

628
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,890
requiring

629
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
extremely difficult skills.

630
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,260
Isn't that Linglong jade?

631
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,580
How did it turn into a fan?

632
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,980
Calm down.

633
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,100
To better present it,

634
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,420
our chief designer is willing

635
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
to demonstrate it personally.

636
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,540
Please applaud.

637
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,540
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

638
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,860
Go for it.

639
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,540
Let's play some music.

640
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,340
Isn't this Mr. Pei
from the Qipei Pavilion?

641
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,500
- Pei Pei.
- That's right.

642
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,220
- It's Mr. Pei.
- Mr. Pei.

643
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,580
Mr. Pei is on the stage.

644
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,540
- Good!
- Good!

645
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,460
Flashy.

646
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,060
Shameless.

647
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,140
Do you all like it?

648
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,060
- Yes!
- Yes!

649
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,180
Thank you all.

650
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,060
Good for you, Pei Pei.

651
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
You guys are really something.

652
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Although this jade fan
is already a top-quality item,

653
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,100
in terms of artistic attainments

654
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,060
and the selection of materials,

655
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,900
it's still slightly inferior
to the mandarin ducks.

656
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,740
Suyu Pavilion is indeed

657
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,220
the pride of our Yuncui City.

658
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,940
Your Lordship, please wait.

659
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,620
Your Lordship.

660
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,100
Could you please take another look?

661
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,260
This is the long-lost
filigree carving technique.

662
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,940
Exactly.

663
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,460
It was my fault just now.

664
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,390
Not only is this item
in excellent condition,

665
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,440
but it is also extremely
difficult to carve.

666
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
It has made me realize

667
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,380
that there are creative people

668
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,740
who improved our old techniques.

669
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,220
The presentation of this Jade Beauty

670
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,820
has left a deep impression on me.

671
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,780
Your Lordship.

672
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,940
I think Suyu Pavilion is better.

673
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,100
The carving skills
of the jade mandarin ducks

674
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,300
are so profound

675
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,580
and the ice piece is also top-grade.

676
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,020
Truly one of a kind.

677
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,060
Your Lordship.

678
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,380
The quality of this jade fan

679
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,340
is not as good as the mandarin ducks.

680
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,100
But the craftsmanship
and strength are really good.

681
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,620
I think Qipei Pavilion is better.

682
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,740
Suyu Pavilion is better.

683
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,020
I think Qipei Pavilion is better.

684
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,940
Suyu Pavilion is better.

685
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,580
- Qipei Pavilion is better.
- Suyu Pavilion is better.

686
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,310
- Qipei Pavilion is better.
- Suyu Pavilion is better.

687
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,420
Enough.

688
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,740
Since there is a disagreement,

689
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,220
let's take a break.

690
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,940
The result will be announced later.

691
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,500
(Flower Pavilion)

692
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,420
The effect was particularly pretty good.

693
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,020
Everyone was applauding.

694
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,540
Really? I didn't see it.

695
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,620
Don't worry, it will definitely work.

696
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,260
Here it comes.

697
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,310
Your Lordship.

698
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,460
How did it go, Your Lordship?

699
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,940
Please welcome our two contestants

700
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,180
of this Jade Competition,

701
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,740
Qipei Pavilion

702
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,380
and Suyu Pavilion.

703
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,780
- Please come to the stage.
- Good!

704
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,820
Good!

705
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,860
- Qipei Pavilion.
- Suyu Pavilion.

706
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,260
- Qipei Pavilion.
- Suyu Pavilion.

707
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,740
- Qipei Pavilion.
- Suyu Pavilion.

708
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,180
- Qipei Pavilion.
- Suyu Pavilion.

709
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,020
- Qipei Pavilion.
- Suyu Pavilion.

710
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,060
Okay.

711
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,900
- Suyu Pavilion.
- Qipei Pavilion.

712
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,700
I don't think we should vote.

713
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,820
As the lord of a nationally
renowned city of jade items,

714
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,740
at this year's Jade Competition,

715
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,740
Qipei Pavilion and Suyu Pavilion
are tied for the first place.

716
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,820
Does anyone have any objections?

717
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,700
No.

718
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,380
Agree! Agree! Agree!

719
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,380
Calm down.

720
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,940
Agree! Agree! Agree!

721
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,820
Hold on, please.

722
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,150
What's the matter?

723
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,240
You didn't see the gift box

724
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,940
that was delivered
to your house a few days ago, right?

725
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,420
I really haven't had time to open it.

726
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,700
I took the liberty

727
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,180
and asked your guard
to bring the gift box over.

728
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,220
Take a look at it, please.

729
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,060
