Don't worry.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,650
Mr. Hao will take good care of the master.

25
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,110
I found another confession

26
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,620
in the Su family's dungeon.

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,680
The one the City Lord received

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,570
must've been written under duress
by Master Pei.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,620
But if the Crown was stolen by the Su family,

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
why have I never seen

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,530
any related techniques in their house?

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,530
Could it be their plan failed,

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,090
and they didn't get the Crown?

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,900
Or

35
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,300
they couldn't decipher its techniques.

36
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,380
My father had mastered most

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,700
of the techniques on the Crown.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,940
Some were taught

39
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,060
to me by him,

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,420
and others

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,940
were taught by the elders in their spare time.

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,700
What do you plan to do next?

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,420
Seek justice from the City Lord.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,620
But the master is a convicted criminal
by the government.

45
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,380
We lack conclusive evidence

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,380
to prove he was imprisoned by the Su family.

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,340
That would push him right into danger.

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,500
My father is now a state criminal.

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,460
We can't reveal him publicly

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,980
to confront the Su family.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,260
To cover their crimes,

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,940
the Su family likely won't act rashly soon.

53
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,140
For now, we must prioritize safety.

54
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,060
Uncle,

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,700
you said the person accidentally

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,940
discovered Pei Chufeng.

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,580
Why didn't she

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,380
stay to investigate

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,260
or report to the authorities?

60
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,620
Instead, she hurriedly took him away.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,340
She wanted to protect him.

62
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,100
I think this matter

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,940
is connected to the Pei family.

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,540
If it really is the Pei family,

65
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,900
then Pei Chufeng is probably at their place.

66
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,620
Since Pei Chufeng is a convict,

67
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,580
why not report to the City Lord

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,540
and capture him at the Pei's Mansion?

69
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,500
Uncle,

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,380
we can't do that.

71
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,700
We've never imprisoned Pei Chufeng.

72
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,660
How could we know he's still alive?

73
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,540
If we can think of dealing

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,700
with the secret chamber and dungeon,

75
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
the Pei family

76
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,780
could also transfer him quickly.

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,020
Since Pei Chufeng is a convict,

78
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,140
the Pei family wouldn't dare act

79
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
without full confidence.

80
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,620
Now, both families

81
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,860
have to feign ignorance

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,500
and keep the peace.

83
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,780
Yes, yes.

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
We can't do that.

85
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,180
Come in.

86
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,660
Young Master, something happened.

87
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,860
What now?

88
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,940
The men you hired to find Ms. Shuangshuang

89
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,020
are all dead.

90
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
What?

91
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,940
What happened?

92
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,380
I don't know.

93
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,900
Before we found Ms. Shuangshuang,

94
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,890
their bodies were discovered

95
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,020
in an alley in the West Market.

96
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,420
No clues were left behind.

97
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,340
Who did this?

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,780
Master,

99
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,500
you don't even recognize me.

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,660
What did they do to you?

101
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,500
How much suffering

102
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,660
did you endure?

103
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,580
It's a shame the madam passed

104
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,580
before seeing you again.

105
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,260
Do you know Shan Jingtian?

106
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,780
Do you know who tricked him

107
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,540
into stealing the Crown?

108
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
The Crown?

109
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,060
The Crown?

110
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,420
It wasn't me.

111
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,700
I didn't steal the Crown.

112
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,860
- I didn't steal it.
- It's okay.

113
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,820
I didn't steal it.

114
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
Ms. Shan,

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,020
I've heard about your grievances

116
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,820
about the Su and Pei families.

117
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
I've been at the Pei's Mansion for decades.

118
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,580
I've seen everything.

119
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,540
I have no right to speak up,

120
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,220
but now that the master is alive,

121
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,300
I want to defend him a bit.

122
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,220
When the Crown was lost,

123
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,380
the City Lord was on the verge
of losing his position,

124
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,420
and Yuncui City was on the brink of collapse.

125
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,500
But at that moment,

126
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
Suyu Pavilion presented

127
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,940
a replacement Crown,

128
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,420
saving Yuncui City

129
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,820
and earning immense fame.

130
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,220
But think about it.

131
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,580
How could they create

132
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,460
such a royal tribute

133
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,420
in just a few days?

134
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,140
It's obvious someone had premeditated this.

135
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,340
Now, with the master found
in the Su family's dungeon,

136
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
the mastermind behind all this

137
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,420
should be clear to you, Ms. Shuangshuang.

138
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,180
I don't need to say more.

139
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,580
Shuangshuang,

140
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,420
I know you've been

141
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,220
bearing all this alone for years.

142
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,780
We're family,

143
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,060
and you have me.

144
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,140
I won't let you bear it alone anymore.

145
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,140
And I believe

146
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,300
we will find evidence

147
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,860
to clear both our fathers' names.

148
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,260
Alright.

149
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,220
You have me.

150
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,020
No more tears.

151
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,780
Now that Su Jue knows

152
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,300
my father is here,

153
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,700
they will try to harm us.

154
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,020
We need to hide my father first

155
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,140
and plan from there.

156
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,260
But the fall of Qipei Pavilion

157
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,900
means no one wants this hot potato.

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,060
How about staying at my place?

159
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,260
Your place?

160
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,460
Dandan and I

161
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,140
have a quiet house in Xifang Alley.

162
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,540
It's simple,

163
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,540
but it's livable.

164
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,540
I'll move there with the master.

165
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
With me there,

166
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,260
the master will have someone to look after him.

167
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,180
Thank you.

168
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,060
You're awake.

169
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,540
Shuangshuang.

170
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,620
Are you okay?

171
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,340
Of course, I'm okay.

172
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
But you...

173
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,820
Why did you push yourself?

174
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,820
Well.

175
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,380
I was worried about you

176
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,740
and wanted to be your protector.

177
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,940
This is no time

178
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,500
for jokes.

179
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,180
My leg...

180
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,140
I've contacted

181
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,740
the best doctor, Doctor Qu.

182
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
He'll be here soon.

183
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,420
My leg won't heal, will it?

184
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,900
Don't talk like that.

185
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,380
Doctor Qu is the best healer.

186
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,620
He will find a way.

187
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,980
Even if my leg can't be healed,

188
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,140
it's worth trading my legs

189
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,780
for your safety.

190
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,140
Don't blame yourself.

191
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Thank you.

192
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
Please.

193
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,020
Doctor Qu.

194
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,300
Let me see.

195
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,220
Young Master.

196
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
If my legs don't heal,

197
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,380
I won't be able to serve you anymore.

198
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,460
Don't talk nonsense.

199
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,180
If your legs really can't heal,

200
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,740
I'll take care of you
for the rest of your life.

201
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,500
All his bones are shattered.

202
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
What should we do now?

203
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,860
I can only set the bones by hand.

204
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,340
When he can barely stand,

205
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,460
he'll need exercise

206
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,820
to recover.

207
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,740
Firstly,

208
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,460
his bones are badly shattered.

209
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,100
I can only align them by touch.

210
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,020
I can't guarantee perfect alignment.

211
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,100
Even if he stands,

212
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
he'll still have a limp.

213
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,820
Secondly,

214
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,820
the pain of setting shattered bones

215
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,300
is unbearable.

216
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,580
He will suffer greatly.

217
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,540
You are the doctor Shuangshuang trusts,

218
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,300
so I trust you too.

219
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,060
Let's begin.

220
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,620
He can't watch this.

221
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,740
(Peace and Tranquility)
- Ladies, help me here.

222
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,580
OK.

223
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,100
I can't do it.

224
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,980
I don't want the treatment.

225
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,780
Let me go.

226
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,620
Kill me.

227
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,740
It hurts.

228
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,140
It hurts.

229
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,300
Liu, you have to hold on.

230
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,420
It hurts.

231
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,060
I don't want it.

232
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,060
I don't want it.

233
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,260
Let me go.

234
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,420
It hurts.

235
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,100
It's done.

236
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,420
Let me check your pulse again.

237
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,660
How is he?

238
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,460
Don't worry. It was successful.

239
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
By the way,

240
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,260
I think I found...

241
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,660
(Peace and Tranquility)

242
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,100
Is this the legendary water amber?

243
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,260
Yes.

244
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,380
It disappeared completely

245
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,980
after the Crown was lost.

246
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,100
I can't believe

247
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
it's been hanging around your neck.

248
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,140
Why was it encased in alum?

249
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,420
I heard from my mother

250
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,900
that water amber is extremely precious.

251
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,060
If exposed for too long,

252
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,260
it would rust,

253
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,300
forming a surface like an egg.

254
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,220
Because of this,

255
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,540
my father encased it in a glass shell

256
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,580
and placed it on the Crown.

257
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,220
The Crown's top was detachable,

258
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,620
so it could be easily removed by the Emperor.

259
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,060
The glass shell must have been broken,

260
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,580
so it was encased in alum.

261
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,180
I never expected

262
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,180
Guard Zhao to hide it

263
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,700
on Dandan all this time.

264
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,300
For years,

265
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
I've been searching

266
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,540
for the other half of the Crown and its jewels.

267
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,860
Now it seems laughable.

268
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,020
If I'm correct,

269
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,940
with the loss of the water amber,

270
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,700
the other half of the Crown

271
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,740
must have been lost

272
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,700
in the wilderness during the fight.

273
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,220
Or it's

274
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,380
with the Su family.

275
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,660
The Crown has always been in their hands,

276
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,420
but they couldn't decipher it

277
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,180
and caused others' families to be destroyed.

278
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,100
Despicable.

279
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,380
How is he?

280
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,020
He's taken my medicine

281
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,340
and is sleeping.

282
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,100
You can rest easy now.

283
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,500
I owe you a great debt of gratitude.

284
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,660
Please accept my bow.

285
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,620
You silly girl.

286
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,580
How many times have I told you

287
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,980
not to mention gratitude to me?

288
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,300
Doctor Qu,

289
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,420
I have another request.

290
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,620
What is it?

291
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,340
Another patient needs your help.

292
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,860
I'm exhausted today.

293
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,140
Let me rest,

294
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,180
and we'll discuss it tomorrow.

295
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,820
Alright, I'll visit you tomorrow.

296
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,380
Thank you.

297
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,300
You want him to treat Master Pei's madness?

298
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,900
You totally get me.

299
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,180
Can he really be cured?

300
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
Let's have Doctor Qu try.

301
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
If he can't do it,

302
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,060
no one can.

303
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,820
(Suyu Pavilion)

304
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,100
The precision of this knife work

305
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,500
is remarkable for just a few months
of practice.

306
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,660
I've spent my whole life studying it.

307
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,340
What am I lacking?

308
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,060
How's it going?

309
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,340
Young Master, as you suspected,

310
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,300
the Pei's family sent someone out overnight,

311
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
but at the alley in the North Market,

312
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,980
they split into two groups.

313
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,140
The alleyways are intricate,

314
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,340
and the hired trackers lost them.

315
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,380
Useless!

316
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,700
Please calm down.

317
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,540
We've confirmed they are in that area.

318
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,980
Our men are searching through the night.

319
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,100
We should find them soon.

320
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,740
Once you find them, kill them.

321
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,100
Yes.

322
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Pei Pei,

323
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,740
your mistake

324
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,500
was constantly opposing me.

325
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,500
How's it going?

326
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,900
Come on.

327
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,420
Let's sit and discuss.

328
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,140
He's been in a cold and damp place
for a long time.

329
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,260
The dampness invaded his heart,

330
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,060
and he suffered severe trauma,

331
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,660
causing a mental breakdown.

332
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,060
Is there a way to cure him?

333
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,380
I can use acupuncture

334
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,100
to expel the cold from his body.

335
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,660
When his acupuncture points open,

336
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,300
if we can use something

337
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
that scares him

338
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,580
to shock his mind,

339
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,260
we might restore his sanity.

340
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,540
Is there any danger?

341
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,300
There's no life-threatening risk,

342
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,460
but if it fails,

343
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,380
his mental state may worsen.

344
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,860
My father had a proud spirit.

345
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,980
If given the choice,

346
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,580
he would rather take the risk

347
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,860
than live like this.

348
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,900
The acupuncture is complete.

349
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,420
Now, we begin the mental stimulation.

350
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,620
Doctor, please proceed.

351
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,540
Dad.

352
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
Dad.

353
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,340
It's me, Pei Pei.

354
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,460
I'm Pei Pei.

355
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,860
Your Pei.

356
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,420
Do you remember me, Dad?

357
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,420
Dad, it's Pei.

358
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,700
Look at me.

359
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,420
It's not enough.

360
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,580
Perhaps I have a way.

361
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,260
Is this the legendary Moonlight Crown?

362
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,420
This...

363
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,820
Dad,

364
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,460
look at this.

365
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,500
Do you recognize it?

366
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,740
You're lucky

367
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,740
to survive this.

368
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,260
Since you're still alive,

369
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,460
you'll be used by us.

370
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,260
Hungry?

371
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,420
Then eat this.

372
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,820
- Master!
- Dad!

373
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,980
Dad.

374
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,900
Dad.

375
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,940
Dad.

376
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,540
What's happening?

377
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,780
It's nothing serious.

378
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,940
He's just fainted.

379
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,780
Let him lie down.

380
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,180
I'm truly sorry.

381
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,620
I did my best.

382
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,220
This was our choice.

383
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,020
Not your fault.

384
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,100
Will he be in danger?

385
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,500
He's weakened,

386
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,900
and he'll need time to recover his strength,

387
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,420
but he won't be in any danger.

388
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,460
Rest assured.

389
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,420
You've worked hard today.

390
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,940
Please rest.

391
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,980
I'll see you out.

392
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,140
Farewell.

393
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,540
Take care, Doctor.

394
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,740
Don't worry.

395
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,740
The master will be fine.

396
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,940
Let me.

397
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,500
The master dedicated his life to his work

398
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,180
but now he's like this.

399
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,420
He's still free from all worries.

400
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,220
Maybe this is a release for him.

401
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,540
Pei.

402
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,900
Pei.

403
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,780
Pei.

404
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,140
Dad, I'm here.

405
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,140
- Pei.
- Dad.

406
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,780
Here.

407
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,620
I'm Pei.

408
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Do you recognize me now?

409
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,300
You've grown so much.

410
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
Dad.

411
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,140
Pei.

412
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,380
Dad.

413
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,060
Liu, time to eat.

414
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,900
Thank you.

415
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,220
Shuangshuang,

416
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,820
I'm so happy to see you

417
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,340
back with us.

418
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,500
Honestly, I never thought...

419
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,220
Master Pei would come back alive

420
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,620
and cured.

421
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,860
Heaven is truly watching over us.

422
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
Yes.

423
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,540
I want to help now,

424
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,580
but I'm bedridden with broken bones.

425
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,020
There's nothing I can help.

426
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,700
Just focus on recovering.

427
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,460
Don't worry about anything.

428
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,700
Who's there?

429
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Speak up!

430
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,460
Are you sent by Su Jue?

431
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,420
Dad, let's eat.

432
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,700
Master, take it slow.

433
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,300
Master, have a seat.

434
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,820
Who is this?

435
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,020
I'm Dandan from Qipei Pavilion.

436
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,860
Dad,

437
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,140
Dandan is now Qipei Pavilion's shopkeeper

438
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,740
and also

439
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,420
my fiancée.

440
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,660
- Have a seat.
- OK.

441
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,740
OK.

442
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,980
More importantly,

443
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,100
she is Guard Zhao's daughter.

444
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,220
What?

445
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,420
Ms. Dandan is Guard Zhao's daughter.

446
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,780
Guard Zhao died protecting me.

447
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Now, you're part of our family.

448
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,100
Perhaps it's a chance given by gods

449
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,900
for us to repay him.

450
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,660
Let's eat.

451
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,100
Dandan.

452
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,860
Shuangshuang, you're back.

453
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,740
Are you all okay?

454
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,340
We're fine.

455
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,700
Sit and eat.

456
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,180
Is Liu settled in?

457
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,020
Thank you.

458
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,060
Pei, who is this young lady?

459
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,500
This is Ms. Shuangshuang.

460
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,060
Her father is Shan Jingtian,

461
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,420
who was deceived into stealing the Crown.

462
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,260
What?

463
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,860
That incident involved

464
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,580
so many innocent people.

465
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
What's more despicable

466
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,340
is that these children were dragged into it

467
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,740
over the years.

468
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,780
I shouldn't say this

469
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,660
in front of the children,

470
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,700
but I must speak my mind.

471
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,500
Eighteen years ago,

472
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,820
Su Zhiyan, for his own gain,

473
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,580
tried to steal the Crown.

474
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,940
Despite his elaborate plans,

475
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,500
he got nothing.

476
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,100
The Crown

477
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,900
was broken and lost.

478
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
If I have to blame someone,

479
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,380
it's the Su family for their wickedness.

480
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,020
But

481
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,980
the Su family

482
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,700
didn't stop there.

483
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,900
They spread rumors,

484
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,020
accusing me of stealing the Crown.

485
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,580
They even threatened me

486
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,060
with Qipei Pavilion's business,

487
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,820
forcing me to let Pei

488
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,180
quit the Jade Competition.

489
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,820
Pei,

490
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,620
I was a coward back then.

491
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,660
I've failed you.

492
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,780
Dad.

493
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,940
In the end,

494
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,900
Su Jue's uncle Wang Jiu

495
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,220
set me up in the inn

496
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,420
and locked me up for over a decade.

497
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,340
I was suffering there,

498
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,220
living like a crazy animal.

499
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,700
Dad,

500
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,060
that's water under the bridge.

501
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,100
Let's not dwell on the past.

502
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
We're reunited now.

503
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,780
Let's enjoy this meal.

504
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,140
Don't worry.

505
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,860
I won't let the villains go unpunished.

506
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Alright.

507
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,180
Come.

508
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,540
Here, Dad.

509
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,380
Eat first.

510
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,340
Dandan, you go inside.

511
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,180
Stay safe.

512
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,660
Shuangshuang, are you alright?

513
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,300
I'm fine.

514
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,940
They're from the Su family
trying to silence Master Pei.

515
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,700
I've subdued one at Pei's Mansion,

516
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
but like the others,

517
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,780
he bit his tongue

518
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,100
to avoid exposure.

519
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Where should we go now?

520
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,700
This place has been exposed.

521
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,220
Let's return to Pei's Mansion.

522
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,700
By the mandate of heaven.

523
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,020
(Xuanzheng Hall)
To the Lord of Yuncui City.

524
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,860
Useless.

525
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,100
You can't even deal with a dying mad old man.

526
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,420
What can you do for me?

527
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,220
Young Master, please forgive me.

528
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,060
I underestimated the Pei family.

529
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,220
It was my oversight.

530
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,780
Don't give me that crap.

531
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,980
Tell me. What are you going to do now?

532
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,300
Young Master, the City Lord summons you.

533
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Continue searching.

534
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,460
If there's another mishap,

535
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,500
you'll join those dead men.

536
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,500
(Xuanzheng Hall)

537
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,060
Greetings, Your Lordship.

538
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,260
Rise.

539
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,220
May I ask why you've summoned us so urgently?

540
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,780
(Reforge the Moonlight Crown)

541
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,820
This...

542
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,860
You read correctly.

543
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,860
The Empress is critically ill,

544
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,420
and her only regret

545
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,660
is not having the Moonlight Crown

546
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,020
from years ago.

547
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,220
The Emperor has sent an urgent decree,

548
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,540
ordering us to quickly restore

549
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,420
the Crown from the original design

550
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,420
to fulfill the Empress' wish.

551
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
Your Lordship,

552
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,220
after Pei Chufeng

553
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,620
embezzled the Crown,

554
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,780
didn't we deliver

555
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,420
another crown on time?

556
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,300
Indeed, you accomplished the mission

557
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,220
and delivered a substitute,

558
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,300
saving us from the Emperor's wrath.

559
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
But remember.

560
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,660
The Empress was dissatisfied

561
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,260
with that crown.

562
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,380
She played with it briefly and discarded it.

563
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,940
She didn't even wear it
on her birthday banquet.

564
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,340
That's the Imperial Palace.

565
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,740
They have everything.

566
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,620
We can't just casually make do.

567
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,820
But, Your Lordship,

568
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,820
even Pei Chufeng,

569
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,340
leading so many master craftsmen,

570
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,780
took several months
to create the Moonlight Crown.

571
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,940
Now, with the Empress critically ill
and time running out,

572
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,260
- I fear...
- This is an imperial order,

573
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,540
not a discussion.

574
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,380
It's absurd,

575
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,100
but in Yuncui City,

576
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,340
the Suyu Pavilion

577
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,620
is our only hope.

578
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,060
No matter how,

579
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,420
you must recreate a new Crown asap.

580
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,900
Otherwise, your business

581
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,180
will be ruined.

582
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,300
Yes.

583
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,580
I'll have the original design
sent to your residence.

584
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,900
Start immediately.

585
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,300
Don't delay.

586
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,860
If you fail the Emperor's command,

587
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,140
no one will be spared.

588
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,300
Yes.

589
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,260
Yes.

590
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,060
Go.

591
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,700
Be careful.

592
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,020
How is it?

593
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,540
One, two, three.

594
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,300
Careful. Be careful.

595
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,900
How is it? Does it work smoothly?

596
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,660
Look, it's perfect.

597
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,380
Master.

598
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,500
- Dad.
- Master.

599
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,100
My legs are crippled.

600
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,380
I can't bow to you.

601
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
No need.

602
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,620
We are all

603
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,540
in this together now.

604
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,100
Who's whose master anymore?

605
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,620
My father is right.

606
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,340
We're family now.

607
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,500
No need for formalities.

608
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,980
Dad, how's your health?

609
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,100
I'm fine. No problem.

610
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,700
I've fought my whole life,

611
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,780
and in the end, it's all in vain.

612
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,860
Master, life is like that,

613
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,700
with ups and downs, highs and lows.

614
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,260
Sometimes we have, yet sometimes we don't.

615
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,420
It's what makes life exciting.

616
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,300
My favorite saying is,

617
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,860
"Fighting with people and heaven"

618
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,260
"is endless fun."

619
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,500
Life is long.

620
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,140
What's meant to be will be.

621
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,300
It's just a pity

622
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,100
that Xiangjun is no longer with us.

623
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,220
Alright, enough of that.

624
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,060
Today, I will cook for you myself

625
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,740
and make you a delicious meal.

626
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,220
But Dad, your health...

627
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,980
I'm fine. It's not hard labor.

628
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,540
Do you really think I'm useless?

629
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,740
Haven't you

630
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,460
missed my cooking for years?

631
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,980
Great, great.

632
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,660
I'll trim the vegetables.
I'm not useless either.

633
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,660
Come.

634
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,140
Young Master.

635
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,780
You haven't slept all night?

636
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,620
How is it?

637
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,620
We've studied the design all night.

638
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,300
The jade carving is extremely intricate,

639
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,500
with tiny hollow sections.

640
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,940
With our skills,

641
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,420
we can't do it.

642
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,780
Unless...

643
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Unless what?

644
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,700
Unless we have top-quality jade

645
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,180
that won't lose its luster

646
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,100
or break

647
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,020
no matter how it's cut.

648
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,420
You mean Nuwa's celestial jade?

649
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,750
Across the four regions and eight cities,

650
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,060
no one has better jade than Suyu Pavilion.

651
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,020
What use are you then?

652
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
How's the gold and silver part?

653
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,820
Please.

654
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,860
Young Master,

655
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,220
a third of the crown

656
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,060
uses the gold

657
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,780
and silver inlay technique left by Ms. Shan.

658
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,100
Though our skills

659
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,140
aren't as refined as hers,

660
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,180
we can barely manage.

661
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,700
The key is the pearl inlay and edge melding.

662
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,460
We can't figure it out.

663
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,060
Useless!

664
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,060
All of you.

665
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,660
Mr. Su, no use just getting angry.

666
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,660
The City Lord's deadline is tight.

667
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,340
You better think of something fast.

668
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,740
I'm thinking.

669
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,500
It doesn't look like you're thinking,

670
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,380
more like playing house.

671
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,260
This Crown's restoration

672
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,180
is crucial to Yuncui City's safety.

673
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,940
You better take it seriously.

674
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,850
Who are you

675
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,150
to lecture me on my plans?

676
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,990
You...

677
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,420
Let go!

678
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,020
Well.

679
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,660
Our young master is under a lot of pressure.

680
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,820
He's very tense.

681
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,900
Don't take it to heart.

682
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,820
We're all in this together.

683
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,220
Don't take it to heart.

684
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
Please don't get mad.

685
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,940
Jue,

686
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,060
he works for the City Lord.

687
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,220
Why argue with him?

688
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,460
I don't care about that.

689
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,700
What does he know?

690
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,860
Talking nonsense here.

691
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,700
Alright, alright.

692
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,540
I know you're under a lot of pressure,

693
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,420
but we need to find a way

694
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,380
to solve this problem first.

695
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,940
Have you found a replacement
for the amber at the Crown's top?

696
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,940
I contacted Mr. Qin.

697
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,740
He found a major source,

698
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,260
saying a priceless

699
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,900
luminous pearl

700
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,820
is on its way.

701
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,380
Good.

702
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,140
Stay calm.

703
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,420
Alright, alright.

704
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,660
I'll go check.
