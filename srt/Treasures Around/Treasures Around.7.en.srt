00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,630
Your Lordship.

33
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,160
This jade fan was originally my entry.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
But a while ago,

35
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,280
a draft went missing from my house.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
You...

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,120
Just in case,

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,000
afraid someone would plagiarize my work,

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,040
I temporarily changed my entry.

40
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,720
As for this finished jade fan,

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,120
I had to give it to you early
as a birthday gift.

42
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,750
That's impossible.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,000
I've been careful with it these days.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,160
No one could have touched it.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,880
Pei Pei, how dare you?

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
Your Lordship,

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,720

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,070
is much rougher compared to mine.

50
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,120
You intended to plagiarize.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,840
Of course, you need to improve your skills.

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
You're talking nonsense.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,880
I didn't plagiarize at all.

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,910
Your Lordship,

55
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,600
this was polished by me and Mr. Pei,

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
without any reference to any other work.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I swear to God.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
It's ridiculous.

59
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,720
If their own jade appraiser can testify,

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
can my uncle

61
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,880
also testify for me?

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,670
How dare you?

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,950
In the biggest event of Yuncui City,

64
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,950
such absurd things happened.

65
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,470
Now that the evidence is conclusive,

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,560
you still dare to argue?

67
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,070
Not just this time,

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
Qipei Pavilion is permanently
disqualified from competing.

69
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
From now on,

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,440
you cannot touch any official contributions.

71
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,440
You are truly despicable.

72
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,750
Isn't it you who's despicable?

73
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,160
(Qipei Pavilion)
They owe us money.

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,910
Let's take their things.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't leave anything behind.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,320
Take them all.

77
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,750
- Young Master.
- Take them all.

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,950
What are you doing?

79
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,790
Move them all.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,820
- Take them all.
- You can't take them.

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
- Get away.
- Why can't we?

82
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,190
- You can't take them.
- Take them all.

83
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,090
Don't leave anything behind.

84
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,320
- Take them.
- This is...

85
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,350
Get out of the way.

86
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,200
A few days ago,

87
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,430
we were all fooled by you,

88
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,990
so we left without money.

89
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,110
Now you're defeated and punished.

90
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,790
Supplier's supply rights are also cut off.

91
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,430
What else do you have to say now?

92
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,270
That's because...

93
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
That's right.

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,910
Now even the official supply is cut off.

95
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,040
Who are you going to sell those treasures to?

96
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,200
Could it be sold to the common folks?

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
This was agreed upon beforehand.

98
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,280
We supply first,

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,350
and you inject funds after selling.

100
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,990
Now you're not even qualified to sell.

101
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,040
How do you pay back?

102
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,760
Come on, take this too.

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,960
- That's right.
- Let me tell you.

104
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,790
Today, taking these things isn't enough.

105
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,670
You wait for me, old thing.

106
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,150
You...

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
What are you doing?

108
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,310
Come here and see.

109
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,790
- Let me tell you who he is.
- Come over.

110
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,600
He's the Miss Pei who cheated,

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
got caught, and lost the game.

112
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,230
Good for you.

113
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,070
Let me go.

114
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,150
Let go.

115
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
Let go of me.

116
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Pei.

117
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,150
Forget it.

118
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,870
- He's capable now.
- Right.

119
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,470
Two more people come in and continue.

120
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,080
Take them all.

121
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,080
Take them all.

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Move, move, move.

123
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Take them all.

124
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,310
- Take them all.
- Take them all.

125
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,390
Don't leave a single thing.

126
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,470
Don't leave a single thing.

127
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,870
It's just losing a game.

128
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
Nothing serious.

129
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,110
As for those unscrupulous suppliers,

130
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,110
we lost money and gave goods.

131
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,400
Though it's a bit tight now,

132
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,470
there's always a way out.

133
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,430
We can always start over.

134
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,430
Mother, sorry.

135
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,630
Pei.

136
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,760
You did a great job.

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,110
Ms. Shan is young and inexperienced.

138
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,760
Letting her be Young Master's partner

139
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
is not a good decision.

140
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,990
That is my decision.

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
Blame me if you have to.

142
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,160
It's the bad guy's fault.

143
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,230
It has nothing to do with these two kids.

144
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
But Qipei Pavilion

145
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,790
should be thoroughly investigated

146
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,280
to check if there's a mole.

147
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,550
As for their performance,

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,080
I am satisfied from start to finish.

149
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,110
Winning or losing is common.

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,640
This is over.

151
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Never mention it again.

152
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,910
By the way, we have no evidence now.

153
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,990
The City Lord will only punish us more.

154
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,080
Wait until we have new evidence

155
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
to prove our innocence again.

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,910
You may leave now.

157
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,240
Yes.

158
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,400
Pei, stay.

159
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,800
Pei.

160
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,680
Come, sit down.

161
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,950
Mother.

162
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay.

163
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,670
No need to say more.

164
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,080
From the moment

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
you picked up the knife again,

166
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
I've been satisfied.

167
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,200
Your and Dandan's efforts

168
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,720
and stubbornness for the Jade Competition,

169
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,670
I have seen it all.

170
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,670
I didn't interfere,

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,790
because I hope you can grow together

172
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,280
and rekindle confidence in life.

173
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
As for winning or losing,

174
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,470
I don't care at all.

175
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,630
But Mother,

176
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,790
I don't deserve it.

177
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,280
I'm not worse than Su Jue.

178
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,470
I know.

179
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,840
They use despicable means.

180
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,960
We don't have to argue with them.

181
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
As long as you stand up again,

182
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,160
Qipei Pavilion will prosper sooner or later.

183
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,670
I have confidence in you.

184
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,920
By the way,

185
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,840
don't blame Dandan for this matter.

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
She did her best.

187
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,150
Of course not.

188
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,640
Answered so soon.

189
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,400
This is not like your usual attitude
towards her.

190
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Could it be...

191
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,280
Mother, no.

192
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
You rest first. I'll go now.

193
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,670
How's it going?

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,720
Something's wrong?

195
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
Are we going to be punished?

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,830
Young Master, Dandan.

197
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,790
How is it? Did you find her?

198
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,190
I had her at the teahouse.

199
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's go.

200
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
Speak up.

201
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,710
Of course, it's arranged by Su Jue.

202
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,240
You don't need to cover for him.

203
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Right.

204
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,710
I changed sides temporarily

205
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
and joined Suyu Pavilion.

206
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,070
Su Jue has worked with Madam Yang for years.

207
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,880
I can't afford to offend him.

208
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,070
This is my own wrongdoing,

209
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,790
but Jade Beauty's matter was voluntary.

210
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,430
Even if you make a fuss with the City Lord,

211
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
it won't help.

212
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,070
I'm not talking about the Jade Beauty's matter.

213
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,630
What?

214
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Su Jue prepared a jade fan

215
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,520
very similar to ours

216
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,670
and gave it to the City Lord early,

217
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,790
accusing us of plagiarism.

218
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,030
But about this jade fan,

219
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
except for us,

220
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,910
only you know everything about it.

221
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,240
Do you suspect

222
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,520
I leaked it to Su Jue?

223
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,280
If I did something wrong, I will admit it.

224
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,950
After all, who I become Jade Beauty for

225
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
is my own right.

226
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,240
But I can't do this kind of sneaky

227
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,590
and harmful thing.

228
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,710
Right. I've seen Su Jue.

229
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,880
Mr. Su.

230
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,640
So anxious.

231
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,240
Going to be the Jade Beauty for Qipei Pavilion?

232
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm in a hurry to return to Flower Pavilion.

233
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,480
It's not convenient to stay long.

234
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,590
What's the rush?

235
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,950
Our meeting is fate.

236
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,190
Tell me.

237
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,360
What jade does the Pei family use?

238
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,310
How do you plan to present it?

239
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Why?

240
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,120
Want to quit your job at Flower Pavilion?

241
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,120
Is there money to earn a living?

242
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,310
Mr. Pei plans to make a Linglong jade.

243
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,310
Though it's hard to match with dance,

244
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,160
it's the boss's request after all.

245
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,040
I have to accept it.

246
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,950
I only mentioned the Linglong jade.

247
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,710
I didn't mention

248
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
replacing the jade fan.

249
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,240
Though I am just a humble artist,

250
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,830
I still have some sense and conscience.

251
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,150
If you don't believe me,

252
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,670
I can swear to heaven.

253
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,910
- I swear...
- Alright.

254
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,150
You may leave now.

255
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,520
About the Jade Beauty,

256
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,670
I don't think it's her.

258
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,310
If it really is her,

259
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,190
there's no need to mention

260
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,550
the meeting with Su Jue in detail.

261
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,710
She could've hidden it from us.

262
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,240
When I was getting ready for the competition

263
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,430
and looking for craftsmen before,

264
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,790
I saw a drawing.

265
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,710
(Suyu Pavilion)
We hadn't put that on the shelf,

266
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,280
but Suyu Pavilion
already started selling it.

267
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,950
Who exactly is it?

268
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,880
What's this about?

269
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
I'm afraid you're in a bad mood,

270
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,950
so I came with food and drinks.

271
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,570
These are all your favorite food.

272
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,870
I prepared it specially for you.

273
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,720
Eat it now.

274
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,390
What's wrong?

275
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,030
Thank you.

276
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,790
Thank me?

277
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,790
Your efforts aren't less than mine.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
You want to prove yourself more.

279
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,910
You're also very sad.

280
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,310
But you still came to comfort me

281
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,070
at once.

282
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Thank you.

283
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm used to failures. I can handle it.

284
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
But you...

285
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm afraid you're sad here alone.

286
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,590
That was before.

287
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Now that I've decided to stand up again,

288
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,310
it's impossible to give up easily.

289
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,040
That's right. What's the big deal?

290
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,190
We just lost once.

291
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Moreover, he won us

292
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,070
by such disgusting means.

293
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,590
We still have time.

294
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,590
As long as we don't die,

295
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,710
we'll fight him to the end.

296
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,640
I'll expose Su Jue

297
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,760
sooner or later.

298
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,480
Let's wait and see.

299
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,480
If you don't fire me as your jade appraiser,

300
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll accompany you

301
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,160
to the end.

302
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,150
To the end.

303
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,190
I actually said an idiom.

304
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,760
Yeah, you said an idiom.

305
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,360
What about another one?

306
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,360
Well.

307
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,040
We can take turns.

308
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Come on.

309
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,050
Let's drink.

310
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
Come up with an idiom.

311
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
End...

312
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,310
End what?

313
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,750
End...

314
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,020
(Suyu Pavilion)

315
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,070
Five hundred taels of gold.

316
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,910
Good.

317
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,710
Fifty strings of emerald pearls.

318
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,720
Good.

319
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,400
Fifty ingots of silver.

320
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,950
This. This one.

321
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,120
These are silver and gold.

322
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,960
Two hundred taels each.

323
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,830
Take it.

324
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,630
Shopkeeper.

325
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,790
Okay. Keep going. This one.

326
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,190
- This.
- Eight hundred taels of silver.

327
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,270
- Okay.
- Jue.

328
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,590
These are gifts

329
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,550
from the city's dignitaries.

330
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,670
Why don't you take a look?

331
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,710
You just won the Jade Competition.

332
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,120
Why are you still depressed?

333
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,550
Winning the Jade Competition

334
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,280
was planned.

335
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,880
What's there to be happy about?

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,670
But the craftsmanship of Pei Pei's fan

337
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,710
is indeed annoying.

338
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,120
This is weird.

339
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,240
Pei Pei hasn't asked
about jade affairs for many years.

340
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,070
What has made him so excited?

341
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,120
Uncle, it's better to be more careful.

342
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Our status can't be shaken.

343
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,000
He's just a flash in the pan.

344
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,190
He'll stop it in a few days.

345
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
Right, Uncle.

346
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,590
Please find craftsmen
to make a golden bottom bracket

347
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,950
and a crystal cover for the mandarin ducks.

348
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,790
Okay.

349
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,030
Thank you.

350
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,400
I'll go to the workshop.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,840
This.

352
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,280
Tidy up here.

353
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,510
Okay.

354
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,360
This is the silver and jade fan
presented by Qipei Pavilion.

355
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,590
The carving technique
at the fan's handle

356
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,880
is also exquisite,

357
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
requiring

358
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,360
extremely difficult skills.

359
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,910
(Pei Pei's filigree carving technique)

360
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
(is almost as good as that
of the Moonlight Crown.)

361
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,760
(He's so brilliant.)

362
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,520
(Did I bet wrong?)

363
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,550
Young Master.

364
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,710
Why are you still messing
with these worthless things?

365
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
You're already deeply involved
in the Jade Competition.

366
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,880
You're the craftsman who won the first prize.

367
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,760
Who dares not allow you

368
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,190
to work on expensive products?

369
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,590
No, Young Master.

370
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,190
I feel that I am still too inexperienced.

371
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,400
I need more practice for a while.

372
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,630
Also,

373
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,430
I have some opinions of my own.

374
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,150
Let's sit down for this.

375
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,590
Accessories don't have to be expensive
to be good.

376
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,550
After all, there are more
poor people in this world.

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,430
I myself come from a poor family

378
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,880
and have sold jewelry at stalls before.

379
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,950
Perhaps only ten people

380
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,280
can afford expensive accessories,

381
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,910
but there may be thousands

382
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,360
who can afford the cheap goods from my stall.

383
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,070
They too have the right to beautify themselves.

384
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,670
I spoke too much.

386
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
No.

387
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,190
What you said makes sense.

388
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,110
As long as you're happy,

389
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,240
I can satisfy you even if it's expensive,

390
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,790
let alone these worthless things.

391
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,280
Thank you, Young Master.

392
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,320
By the way,

393
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,720
the mandarin ducks have been sent out
for detailed refinement.

394
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,200
You'll definitely like it.

395
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
Cousin, did your wife
like the osmanthus ointment

396
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,040
- I gave to her last time?
- She loved it.

397
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,240
She said she wanted to thank you.

398
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,190
No need.

399
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,830
If she likes it, I'll send her more next time.

400
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,880
Okay.

401
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,960
Are you done?

402
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,110
Not yet. What's up?

403
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,390
These hulls are from you.

404
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,440
Can't you clean up?

405
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,630
Aren't you sweeping right now?

406
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,200
But you keep throwing them.

407
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,630
- You can sweep again.
- You two, stop arguing.

408
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,190
Li,

409
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,040
- come here.
- Coming.

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Dump these scraps and garbage together.

411
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,360
Okay.

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,070
You want to throw all these away?

413
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,070
What do we need them for?

414
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,000
To make jewelry to sell to you?

415
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,520
It's a shame to throw them away.

416
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,720
If you want, take them.

417
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,680
The steward won't have to clean up this trash.

418
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,280
I think these scraps

419
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
actually suit you.

420
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,720
Bumpkin.

421
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,760
You really don't need them?

422
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,240
Yes. We don't need them.

423
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,350
Bumpkin,

424
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,190
take them away.

425
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,790
Why is the main door locked so early?

426
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,630
Come on.

427
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,960
Caught you.

428
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,480
You saw it, didn't you?

429
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,830
Liu, did you see it too?

430
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,180
Tell us.

431
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,540
When did you start stealing things?

432
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,100
You told me...

433
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,140
Forget it.

434
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
If I ask you now,

435
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,060
you won't admit it.

436
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,140
Dandan,

437
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,740
with so many valuable things at home,

438
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,620
why steal these scraps?

439
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,260
Madam, you're reasonable.

440
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,620
Young Master's spittoon
is more expensive than this.

441
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,020
Why would I steal these scraps?

442
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,780
You were afraid

443
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,980
other things would be obvious.

444
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,500
Though these scrapes seem worthless,

445
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,060
they can accumulate

446
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,540
into some money.

447
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,700
Dandan, don't be angry.

448
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,140
I was just guessing.

449
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,380
But seeing you climbing over the wall

450
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,300
so skillfully just now,

451
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,780
it seems like you've done this before.

452
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,260
You can tell us beforehand
if something happens.

453
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,340
It's dangerous to climb walls late at night.

454
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,620
I grew up wild since childhood.

455
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,460
Young Master.

456
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,180
Isn't this your idea?

457
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,300
What?

458
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,380
After losing the contest,

459
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,740
you worked hard to manage the Pavilion.

460
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,140
Wasn't it written on the jade sales strategy?

461
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,020
We should make good use of the scraps

462
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,100
and develop low-cost jade jewelry
for mass sales.

463
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,940
Remember?

464
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,140
Right.

465
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,460
There's indeed such a thing.

466
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,060
So, Dandan,

467
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,780
what are you going to do with these scraps?

468
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,140
Madam, here's the thing.

469
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,100
I have a sister

470
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,060
who used to sell jewelry at the West Market.

471
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,020
The things she made were extremely beautiful.

472
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,300
It's just that our family

473
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,620
didn't have much savings,

474
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,300
so she used cheap materials like stones

475
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,140
and wood.

476
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,260
Today, when I passed by the workshop,

477
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,460
I saw these scraps

478
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,860
and thought it'd be a pity to throw them away.

479
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,700
I thought I'd show them to my sister

480
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,140
and see if she could do some processing

481
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,940
to turn them into rare jewelry.

482
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,180
How much could jewelry

483
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,300
made from these things sell for?

484
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,980
We lost the Jade Competition because of you.

485
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
Now, you're messing around again.

486
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,020
It's small profits but quick returns, okay?

487
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,540
Besides, many people want

488
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,740
my sister's jewelry.

489
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,060
Before, I thought

490
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,300
about making some jade jewelry

491
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,620
for the people with low income,

492
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,940
but I was afraid
the income wouldn't cover the cost.

493
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,300
After we lost the Jade Competition
because of being set up,

494
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,380
we may lose some noble clients

495
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,980
for a while,

496
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,180
but ordinary people are different.

497
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,820
They don't care about the Jade Competition.

498
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,900
They only care about good value for money.

499
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,860
We can't rely on a single tree to survive.

500
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,140
If we change our approach,

501
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,020
there may be a chance to turn the tide.

502
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,100
Mr. Hao, what do you think?

503
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,260
I think Dandan is right.

504
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,580
Spread the word

505
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,020
and let the workshop rush

506
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,580
to use these scraps

507
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,780
and some simple decorations

508
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,860
to make a batch of accessories.

509
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,740
Dandan, you're familiar with it.

510
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,300
Give some advice to the masters.

511
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,020
Alright, Madam.

512
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,980
Madam.

513
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,660
Is this decision too hasty?

514
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,900
Alright, alright.

515
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,700
It's late now.

516
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,820
I'm going to bed.

517
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,220
In the future,

518
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,980
don't bother me with these trivial matters.

519
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,020
I still want to live a few more years.

520
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,660
Madam, take care.

521
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,180
I think this idea is excellent.

522
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,460
Let me.

523
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,580
I'll do it.

524
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,580
What's this called?

525
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,900
This is going for wool and coming back shorn.

526
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,980
This is too clever by half.

527
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,700
This is paying a double penalty.

528
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,820
- You...
- What's wrong?

529
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,580
Are you angry?

530
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,740
Ms. Cuiliu, take care.

531
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,380
Young Master, time for breakfast.

532
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,900
Let me help you.

533
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,260
Come.

534
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,220
Good.

535
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,700
Drink.

536
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
Here. Come and sit.

537
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,340
Come.

538
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,460
- Have some porridge.
- Wait.

539
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,620
It's hot.

540
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,700
Hot.

541
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,060
Wait.

542
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,140
Did you poison this porridge?

543
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Young Master, how could you say that?

544
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,060
Even if I had ten times the courage,
I wouldn't dare.

545
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,460
Here.

546
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,060
You seem off today.

547
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,060
Being overly attentive for no reason.

548
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,860
Surely, there's a trick.

549
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,660
Young Master, how could you say that?

550
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,020
I'm your maid.

551
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,380
It's my duty.

552
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,420
Besides breakfast,

553
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,220
the tea is brewed, the ink is prepared,

554
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,500
and the ground is cleaned.

555
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,380
Eat breakfast before it gets cold.

556
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,700
If there's nothing else,
I'll go to the workshop.

557
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,540
Wait.

558
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,060
Are you trying to slip away?

559
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,940
Did you forget?

560
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,260
Madam said I need to go to the workshop
when I'm free

561
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,940
to advise those masters.

562
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,620
Young Master.

563
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,420
About yesterday...

564
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,410
No need to mention it again.

565
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,380
It wasn't intentional.

566
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,300
Blaming Dandan was a mistake.

567
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,860
I feel particularly guilty.

568
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,980
Dandan prepared such greasy food for you.

569
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,740
Let me brew you some Pu'er tea.

570
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
Don't.

571
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,700
Don't brew Pu'er.

572
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,100
Switch to Maojian, Longjing, or Biluochun.

573
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,540
Why?

574
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,020
Because they are green teas.

575
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,960
They can freshen your breath.

576
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,740
You...

577
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,700
Young Master.

578
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,380
Cuiliu and I are going to brew tea for you.

579
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,180
Let's go.

580
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,660
Let's go.

581
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,900
I think we can add some fabric flowers

582
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,540
to these hairpins.

583
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,700
My sister made them before.

584
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,500
They sold very well.

585
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,940
Don't compare our products
to street stall goods.

586
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,700
If you don't understand, don't speak.

587
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,980
What's wrong with street stall goods?

588
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,060
Madam wants to enter the low-price market now.

589
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,700
We need to connect with the people.

590
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,300
Do you still have the nerve to mention Madam?

591
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,100
She's been deceived by you

592
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,140
for some reason.

593
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,540
That's why I have to deal
with these scraps every day.

594
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,860
How dare you!

595
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,420
How dare you!

596
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,820
Madam is not someone you can discuss.

597
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Young Master, I...

598
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,620
That's not what I meant.

599
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,780
Then what did you mean?

600
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,220
Listen to Madam,

601
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,980
whether you like it or not.

602
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,940
Madam ordered her to assist you,

603
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,980
so you have to endure it.

604
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Don't talk nonsense.

605
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,180
Yes.

606
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,220
Let me announce something to you all.

607
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,140
From today on,

608
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,540
she's in charge.

609
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,940
She can do whatever she wants

610
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,620
and spend as she pleases.

611
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,860
If anyone dares to disobey her orders,

612
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,180
drag them out

613
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,660
and execute them.

614
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,620
Yes, yes.

615
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,020
Yes.

616
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,220
Yes.

617
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,980
Besides,

618
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm her master after all.

619
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,760
Though her ideas are outdated and chaotic,

620
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,980
unreasonably telling you what to do,

621
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,180
you'll just have to endure it.

622
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,740
Yes.

623
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,500
(What am I hoping for?)

624
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,900
(Fengyue Teahouse)

625
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,060
Broken jade jewelry?

626
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,540
It's called broken jade,

627
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,020
but compared to the stones
we used at the street stall,

628
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,220
it's much more sophisticated.

629
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,180
Besides,

630
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,860
the jade articles from the two families

631
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,060
are not affordable for ordinary folks.

632
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,660
This broken jade jewelry

633
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,420
can open up the market

634
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
and benefit the common people.

635
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,940
Killing two birds with one stone.
Why not do it?

636
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,540
Your idea coincides with mine.

637
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,500
But Qipei Pavilion just lost the competition.

638
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,500
They not only didn't blame you

639
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,220
but allowed you to develop new categories?

640
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,140
Madam is magnanimous.

641
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,460
She didn't blame me,

642
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
but the people below

643
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,660
have been making things hard for me.

644
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,420
About the broken jade jewelry this time,

645
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,100
nobody wanted to help.

646
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,340
Unless...

647
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
Unless what?

648
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,940
Unless I can come up

649
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,260
with extremely exquisite jewelry styles.

650
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,060
They'll surely be impressed.

651
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,660
But you

652
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,860
aren't good at this.

653
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,060
Don't I have my kind-hearted, good-natured,

654
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,500
and elegant sister?

655
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,500
You wretched girl.

656
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,060
I really can't do anything with you.

657
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,580
Shuangshuang, you're the best.

658
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,860
Okay, I'll go back and draw some designs

659
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,660
with the cheap materials.

660
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,900
I'll give them to you another time.

661
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,340
I knew it. My sister is the best.

662
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,020
But

663
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,780
let's not let others know about this.

664
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,820
After all, the Su and Pei families are rivals.

665
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,260
It's not appropriate for me
to help you with these things.

666
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,740
Understood.

667
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,620
(Dandan is working so hard for the Pei family,)

668
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,420
(but we don't know
if they're a friend or a foe.)

669
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,020
(Suyu Pavilion)

670
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,100
Mr. Wang.

671
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,900
Ms. Shuangshuang.

672
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,420
Mr. Wang, you've worked hard.

673
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,460
I've prepared a bowl of soup for you.

674
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,540
Oh, you're very kind.

675
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,540
Here, put it here.

676
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,940
During the Jade Competition,

677
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,700
I often had to trouble you.

678
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,220
I haven't had a chance to thank you properly.

679
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,100
How can you say that?

680
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,580
We're all family here.

681
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,060
Why not have a seat?

682
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,860
With Pei's defeat in the competition this time,

683
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,860
it might be even harder
for them to turn things around.

684
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,180
Of course.

685
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,100
It's strange, though.

686
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,460
Earlier, I heard Mr. Su mention

687
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,820
the Pei family embezzling the Moonlight Crown.

688
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,020
If it's true,

689
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,580
why haven't they cleverly utilized it?

690
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,380
They wouldn't dare.

691
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,540
That's a capital crime.

692
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,020
Unless...

693
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,700
Unless their family is on the verge of ruin,

694
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,340
desperate and unable to make ends meet,

695
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,620
then maybe they would

696
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,580
sell off the amber from the Crown.

697
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,380
But even if the Pei family is struggling,
it wouldn't come to this.

698
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,020
Mr. Wang, drink it while it's hot.

699
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,820
(If this old fox is right,)

700
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,420
(the Pei family must be at their wit's end)

701
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,700
(to resort to the Moonlight Crown.)

702
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,340
Liu,

703
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,500
why are you here so late?

704
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,460
You know it's very late?

705
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,500
Young people need to take care of their health.

706
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,460
It's so late, and you're still working.

707
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,460
I have nothing here.

708
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,980
I know you've been busy,

709
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,980
so I'm here to help with some maid's chores.

710
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,460
Liu,

711
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,860
you're one of the few honest people
in this mansion.

712
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,660
Speak frankly. Don't beat around the bush.

713
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,260
I...

714
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,780
You sit first.

715
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,740
Sit, sit, sit.

716
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,100
Sit.

717
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,180
Sit.

718
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,980
Sit, sit, sit.

719
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,580
Sit.

720
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,900
This...

721
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,860
This is something I sewed myself.

722
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,980
I want...

723
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,380
I understand.

724
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,260
I understand everything.

725
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,740
But I can't talk to you

726
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,460
about romance right now.

727
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
I...

728
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,500
Courageously pursue love.

729
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,780
That's right.

730
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,180
- No...
- Don't worry.

731
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,050
I'll keep it secret for you.

732
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,220
(I don't believe I can't kick you out.)

733
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,460
And I'll still treat you as a good friend.

734
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,180
No, you misunderstood. I...

735
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,820
A young man's feelings deserve respect.

736
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,140
I really didn't... I...

737
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,380
- I understand.
- Shameless.

738
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,260
Flirting with the young master

739
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,460
and secretly fornicating with his attendant.

740
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,140
- Where's your sense of shame?
- Let me tell you.

741
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,260
Stop talking nonsense.

742
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,140
You're still trying to argue?

743
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,740
There are evidence and witnesses.

744
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,750
Even if you jump into the Yellow River,
you can't wash this away.

745
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,620
Come on.

746
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,540
Do you have a delusional disorder?

747
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
The world you see

748
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,060
depends on what you think.

749
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,140
You...

750
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,060
What?

751
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,180
What's wrong?

752
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,500
Young Master, I saw

753
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,060
Dandan and Liu's adultery,

754
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,540
but they denied it

755
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,940
and insulted me.

756
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,300
Liu, what's going on?

757
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,620
Young Master,

758
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,060
I just wanted Ms. Dandan

759
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,900
to give this doll to...

760
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,760
Alright, I understand.

761
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,680
I trust you.

762
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,220
This...

763
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,380
- That's it?
- That's it?

764
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,900
- Young Master, you...
- Didn't you say

765
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,860
even jumping into the Yellow River
wouldn't clear things up?

766
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,700
Now things are clear.

767
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,620
I've already forgiven you

768
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,980
for misunderstanding Dandan last time.

769
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,620
But instead of repenting,

770
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,060
you're still making false accusations.

771
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,660
These two people in front of you

772
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
are the closest to me in this world.

773
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,260
Do you think I would listen to you

774
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,380
and misunderstand them?

775
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,420
You don't want your job here, right?

776
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,100
Young Master, I was wrong.

777
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,580
I didn't understand the facts for a moment.

778
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,780
But I meant well.

779
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,460
I've always been thinking of you,

780
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,700
afraid that you'd suffer.

781
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,740
I was wrong about Dandan last time,

782
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,580
and I feel guilty.

783
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,620
I've been wanting to make it up somehow.

784
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
I came today

785
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
to give Dandan a gift.

786
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,300
Give me a gift?

787
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,500
What gift?

788
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,020
A...

789
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
A lipstick.

790
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,620
Show it to me.

791
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,020
Bring it out.

792
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,620
You try it first.

793
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,260
Young Master, I was wrong. I really was.

794
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,580
I...

795
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,620
I was jealous Dandan was getting close to you.

796
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,980
I lost my mind for a moment.

797
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,940
I swear.

798
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,620
There's just a bit of ephedra

799
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
and mimosa inside.

800
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,900
It'll just cause sores and pus for a few days.

801
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,300
Nothing serious.

802
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,220
Young Master, I was wrong.

803
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,340
Give me another chance, Young Master.

804
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,300
You're really incorrigible.

805
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,220
We can't tolerate you anymore.

806
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,420
Go settle your monthly salary
with the shopkeeper

807
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,500
and leave on your own.

808
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,300
Young Master, I was really wrong.

809
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,020
Give me another chance, Young Master.

810
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,940
Please, I beg you.

811
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,860
Get lost.

812
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,380
Rest assured.

813
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,140
There won't be such incidents in the future.

814
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,940
Anyway, she's not happy here.

815
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,980
Finding another job

816
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,260
might be a good thing.

817
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,220
It's late now.

818
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,620
I'm going back to rest.

819
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,260
I have an appointment with my sister tomorrow.

820
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,020
Sister?

821
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,540
Have an appointment with her sister?

822
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,140
Could you give this to your sister for me?

823
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,980
What did you just say?

824
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,620
Young Master,

825
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,620
I didn't say anything.

826
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,420
Look. It's late at night, and it's dark.

827
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,860
How about I cook you some noodles?

828
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,260
No, I'm not tired at all.

829
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,580
Young Master, the kitchen is this way.
