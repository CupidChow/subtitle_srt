23

You little liar.

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,390
- Hurry up.
- You rogue.

25
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,350
Let go of me.

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,990
Mother.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,230
She's the maid you found for me?

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,870
She's a spy sent by Suyu Pavilion.

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,390
Think it over.

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,870
You need evidence to say that.

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,200
Why do you say I'm a spy?

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
Evidence?

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
That day at the auction,

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,720
she bid for the Su family and embarrassed me.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,430
So many people saw it.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,270
It was a test by the Su family's shopkeeper.

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,600
See? She admits it.

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,350
Admit what?

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,390
I didn't go to the Su family.

40
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,230
Do you have any evidence?

41
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,920
Any credible evidence?

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,200
You want evidence?

43
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,830
That day at Flower...

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,630
Flower...

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
Flower what?

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Flower...

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
- Flower Street?
- Yes. Flower Street.

48
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,830
I've never been to Flower Street.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
Young Master, you've got the wrong person.

50
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,510
Even if you didn't go, and I was wrong,

51
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,390
you can't work in Qipei Pavilion.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,070
Pei.

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
Don't mess around.

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Now by your side,

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
those girls serve you.

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,830
You seem quite satisfied,

57
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,790
but I'm not.

58
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,480
Now I've met someone I'm satisfied with.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
What's wrong?

60
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,600
One more person to take care of you. Why not?

61
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,270
I've said everything today.

62
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,080
As for Ms. Dandan,

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,200
apart from taking care of your daily life,

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,390
I also promise

65
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,440
she can take some time off

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,080
to participate in our jade appraisal work.

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,880
- If she performs well,
- This...

68
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,950
she can bring artisans

69
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,550
to participate in this year's Jade Competition.

70
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,640
I've approved it.

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,480
Shopkeeper Hao.

72
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,830
Tell everyone

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
to cooperate.

74
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,640
Hello, Shopkeeper Hao.

75
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,600
My name is Shan Dandan.

76
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,000
As long as we unite,

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,510
we will definitely win this Jade Competition.

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,670
We can shine again.

79
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,830
Nice to meet you.

80
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,950
Such an empty promise.

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,950
Then let me say a few words.

82
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,950
Madam,

83
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,920
the Jade Competition is held every four years.

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,160
It's not trivial.

85
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,790
(Hao Yuan, Qipei Pavilion's shopkeeper)
The winning store will gain fame and business.

86
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,360
It'll also be qualified
to supply officials nationwide.

87
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,230
Ms. Dandan

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,950
is still young

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,920
and has no family craft.

90
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,710
Nor has she worked in a formal jade store

91
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,440
for three to five years.

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,990
Even if she performs well,

93
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,230
she...

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,230
Such a heavy responsibility

95
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,200
Is indeed a bit inappropriate.

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,510
Indeed, Mother.

97
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,230
Though I'm still young,

98
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,160
I've been studying jade for many years.

99
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,670
Madam,

100
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,080
I will definitely do my best.

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
I will not let you down.

102
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,110
Shopkeeper Hao.

103
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,310
I understand.

104
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,590
You want the best for the shop,

105
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,710
but you shouldn't be biased.

106
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
Back in the day,

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,640
I was also a small jade appraiser

108
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,910
without a school or a family.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Mother, I disagree.

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,470
She's a spy sent by the Su family.

111
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,950
If you let her do the jade appraisal work...

112
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,320
Then you go for her.

113
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,430
I won't go.

114
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Just wait.

115
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,470
I will find evidence.

116
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,020
(Suyu Pavilion's Workshop)

117
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,870
Young Master.

118
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,220
Young Master.

119
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,860
Shuangshuang.

120
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,700
Young Master.

121
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,940
Scared you?

122
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,060
It's okay.

123
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,380
Luckily, the hairpin isn't ruined.

124
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,740
Let it be ruined.

125
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,100
If I were bothered by such trivial matters

126
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,020
and argued with you,

127
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,140
it would be a joke if it spread.

128
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,900
Young Master, you're so well-mannered.

129
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,460
Combining gold and silver with jade.

130
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,700
It's wonderful.

131
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,380
I knew I didn't misjudge you.

132
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,940
I heard this technique was used

133
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,380
on the Moonlight Crown.

134
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,580
Have you seen it, Young Master?

135
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,900
The Moonlight Crown?

136
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,500
That was cast by Master Pei.

137
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,700
How would I know?

138
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,580
Sorry, I misspoke.

139
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,780
You're talented, clever,

140
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,140
diligent and hardworking.

141
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,700
How about you join me

142
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,380
at this year's Jade Competition?

143
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,460
Young Master, I lack experience.

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,220
- I'm afraid...
- I haven't even finished,

145
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,260
and you're rushing to refuse.

146
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,940
Just think of yourself as my assistant.

147
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,900
How about it?

148
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,780
Thank you for your appreciation, Young Master.

149
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,860
Young Master.

150
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,940
Young Master, please go ahead.

151
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,420
(Does Su Jue really not know
about the Moonlight Crown,)

152
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,620
(or is he pretending not to know?)

153
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,860
(When the Crown went missing back then,)

154
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,500
(the Su family was the most suspicious.)

155
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,540
(I have to look into this.)

156
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,020
Young Master.

157
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,260
Someone found a jade mine

158
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,660
in the western mountains outside the city.

159
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,820
It's not known
if good materials can be mined.

160
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,860
Is that so?

161
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,020
I'll make sure
someone keeps an eye on it.

162
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,140
But I heard

163
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,020
the Pei family also knows about this news.

164
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,460
The Pei family knows too?

165
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,460
Whether they can mine it or not,

166
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,580
we can't let the Pei family take the lead.

167
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Arrange more people.

168
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,020
If there are obstacles or troubles...

169
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,940
Understood.

170
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,460
(The Su family is already at the top.)

171
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,100
(Why is Su Jue so ruthless
towards the Pei family?)

172

(Late husband Pei Chufeng's Spirit Tablet)

173
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,700
(Late husband Pei Chufeng's Spirit Tablet)

174
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,420
Pei.

175
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,420
Won't you even consider

176
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,940
this year's Jade Competition?

177
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,900
No.

178
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,300
It's been so long.

179
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,820
You...

180
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,720
Stop it, Mother.

181
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,620
I won't participate in the Jade Competition.

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,180
Isn't it all because of him?

183
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,260
He...

184
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,900
He's your father.

185
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,100
Now you won't even call him father?

186
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,140
Pei.

187
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,060
Your father did it for the greater good

188
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,580
and for the safety of our family.

189
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,540
He regretted it before he died,

190
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,980
feeling he shouldn't have
treated you like that.

191
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,060
Mother.

192
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,220
I have things to do.

193
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,060
I'll leave first.

194
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,900
(Late husband Pei Chufeng's Spirit Tablet)

195
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,580
Madam,

196
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,260
you're reminiscing about the past again.

197
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,220
I'm getting older.

198
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,340
Pei is still the same.

199
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,900
Children have their own blessings.

200
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,380
You must take care of yourself more.

201
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,380
But, Madam,

202
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,300
why do you value Dandan so much?

203
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,420
Recently, every new style

204
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,580
we planned to launch at Qipei Pavilion

205
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,420
has been preempted by Suyu Pavilion.

206
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,340
The styles are almost identical,

207
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,580
yet they accuse us of plagiarism.

208
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,820
Why is that?

209
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,740
Don't you understand?

210
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,420
There's a mole in our Pavilion.

211
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,420
What are we going to do about this?

212
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,700
Of course, we need to cultivate anew

213
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
people we can trust.

214
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,540
Dandan

215
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,340
is clever

216
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,060
and enthusiastic.

217
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,740
I like her.

218
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,500
As for the Jade Competition,

219
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,780
will she really participate?

220
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,420
What's most important

221
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,260
for our Pavilion now is transformation.

222
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Otherwise,

223
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,380
who knows how long
we'll be suppressed by Suyu Pavilion?

224
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,900
If Dandan can stir things up a bit,

225
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,740
she might be worthy of a promotion.

226
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,620
Winning the Jade Competition

227
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,580
would be best,

228
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,300
but losing is normal too.

229
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,500
As long as Qipei Pavilion

230
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,420
can be revitalized,

231
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,860
Dandan would be the biggest contributor.

232
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,540
Madam, you're thinking long-term.

233
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,180
Come.

234
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
No need.

235
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,540
However,

236
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,980
it seems the young master doesn't like Dandan.

237
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,180
That's precisely why

238
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,180
I assigned her to him.

239
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,260
With this maid's job,

240
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,940
if Dandan really achieves something

241
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,140
and also disciplines Pei,

242
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,940
then truly,

243
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,540
I've found a treasure.

244
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,660
(Peace and Tranquility)

245
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,820
A good maid

246
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,580
never misses any details.

247
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,980
Tell me.

248
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,860
How much does Madam pay you?

249
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,940
I'll double it.

250
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,820
Leave the Pei's Mansion.

251
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,660
Young Master.

252
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,820
Please have a seat.

253
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,620
Young Master.

254
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,500
What I want isn't money.

255
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,540
I want opportunity and dreams.

256
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,140
True.

257
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,460
The Su family's spy

258
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,580
has finally infiltrated

259
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,860
the Pei family.

260
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,740
How could you easily give up?

261
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,980
No matter what you say,

262
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,580
I walk upright,

263
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,020
with a clear conscience.

264
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,060
I did nothing wrong.

265
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,700
Liu, check.

266
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,660
Okay.

267
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,460
Young Master, this is cleaner than Cuiliu's.

268
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

269
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,340
Young Master, your satisfaction

270
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,540
is the greatest affirmation of my service.

271
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,740
Dan Dandan.

272
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,300
Who would have such a ridiculous name?

273
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,260
Young Master,

274
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,500
that character is "Shan".

275
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,460
I'm Shan Dandan.

276
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,700
Your family's business is vast.

277
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,860
You should keep up with culture.

278
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,740
- You...
- There's more.

279
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,460
Your name is also quite funny.

280
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,820
Pei Pei.

281
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Bah.

282
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,660
Bah.

283
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,860
Bah.

284
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,900
These two words are fine,

285
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,380
but if it were three... Bah, bah, bah.

286
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,420
Too inauspicious.

287
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,100
Young Master, based on Madam's hint,

288
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,020
after cleaning, I'm going to the workshop.

289
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,300
If there's anything, call me.

290
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,540
I'll take my leave.

291
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,700
Young Master,

292
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,340
what are your plans for Shan Dandan?

293
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,140
Young Master, just send her away.

294
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
I can serve you alone.

295
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,740
She's a nobody.

296
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
Do I have to handle her myself?

297
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,100
Do you think Shopkeeper Hao

298
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,340
and those masters in the shop

299
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,140
will listen to a little maid?

300
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,820
You're wise.

301
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,780
Go and secretly keep an eye on her for me.

302
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,220
Report any situation.

303
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,060
Understood.

304
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,460
Young Master.

305
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,980
You...

306
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,340
You can leave too.

307
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,380
Leave.

308
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,980
(Qipei Pavilion's Workshop)

309
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,420
Good morning, everyone.

310
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,260
Need any help?

311
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,500
Not bad, not bad.

312
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,660
- Shopkeeper Hao.
- Shopkeeper Hao.

313
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,020
- Shopkeeper Hao.
- Shopkeeper Hao.

314
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Ms. Dandan.

315
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,660
Looks like it's your first time
in a jade workshop.

316
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,020
It is my first time,

317
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,220
but I know about the jade-making steps

318
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,700
and craftsmanship.

319
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,740
Here's drilling.

320
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,300
Here's grinding.

321
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,740
Here's jade opening.

322
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,380
Hollowing out, engraving,

323
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,620
carving and intricate engraving

324
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,860
should all be in there.

325
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,020
What's the use of knowing the steps?

326
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,020
Mr. Hao,

327
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,100
I will definitely learn from the masters.

328
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,860
Could you assign a designer

329
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,660
to join me in this Jade Competition?

330
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Our Qipei Pavilion has always had a rule

331
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,980
of voluntary participation.

332
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,940
No appointments.

333
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,700
Go talk to the masters yourself.

334
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,740
I have other matters to attend to.

335
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,820
Respected seniors

336
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,100
and masters.

337
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,580
Hello. My name is Shan Dandan.

338
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,220
The Jade Competition is about to begin.

339
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,460
I hope everyone can lend me a hand.

340
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,260
Let's brainstorm together

341
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,180
and come up with a design and drawings.

342
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,660
Do you have confidence?

343
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,380
- What's going on?
- Come on.

344
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,620
Let's go.

345
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,060
Don't mind her.

346
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,060
- No time left.
- Hurry, hurry.

347
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,940
Mr. Wang,

348
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,060
I heard you have the most seniority here.

349
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,500
You not only design

350
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,780
but also carve jade exceptionally.

351
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Can I invite you

352
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,460
to join my team?

353
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,220
Ms. Dandan, you're overpraising me.

354
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
At my age, my eyesight isn't good enough.

355
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,980
I can't handle such a big responsibility.

356
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,260
You should find a young person instead.

357
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,260
I'm about to finish here.

358
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,140
You see.

359
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,740
Your hollow carving is truly remarkable.

360
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,980
Would you like to join my team?

361
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,180
Such bad luck.

362
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,060
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,700
Would you like some tea?

364
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,060
Thank you.

365
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,700
Your design drafts...

366
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,940
These must be kept strictly confidential.

367
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,700
Miss, don't take offense.

368
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,380
Miss, please.

369
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,140
This jade hairpin is so gentle and translucent.

370
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,460
Master, your technique is excellent.

371
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,540
I have an idea.

372
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,100
We can add more fine grooves on the side

373
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,620
and create various jade accessories

374
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,010
that can be freely dismantled and matched.

375
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,440
Young ladies would surely love it.

376
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,320
What do you think?

377
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,340
What do you think?

378
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
He

379
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,420
can't hear well.

380
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,100
(The craftsmen are so hostile towards me.)

381
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,900
(It seems I'll have to start)

382
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,980
(with selling.)

383
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,500
Need any help?

384
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,540
No, no need.

385
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,220
Still quite shy.

386
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,380
Mr. Hao,

387
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,260
let me help you wipe.

388
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,150
No need, no need.

389
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,340
We lack money here,

390
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,780
instead of manpower.

391
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,140
You're snatching their work.

392
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
Do you want them to be fired?

393
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Please come inside.

394
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,340
What accessories do you need?

395
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,780
We have a complete range.

396
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,910
- We have everything.
- I'm not looking.

397
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,220
What's wrong?

398
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,940
Why did you bring me here?

399
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,660
Didn't you say you were buying bracelets?

400
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,260
It means bracelets at Suyu Pavilion.

401
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,700
I've been married to you for so many years.

402
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,820
How can you want me to get by

403
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,740
with outdated bracelets at Qipei Pavilion?

404
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
I don't know this.

405
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Let's go to Suyu Pavilion to buy the best ones.

406
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,740
- Let's go.
- Do you feel sorry?

407
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,060
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

408
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,180
Then I'll buy two.

409
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,180
You can buy ten if you want.

410
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,860
The items in our shop are actually quite good.

411
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,980
Come and take a look.

412
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,700
(How did Qipei Pavilion's reputation)

413
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,300
(become so bad?)

414
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
(The head of a chicken is better
than the tail of a phoenix.)

415
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,580
(If I can find a way)

416
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,740
(to revive Qipei's business and status,)

417
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
(the value I gain)

418
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
(must be greater than at Suyu Pavilion.)

419
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,940
(Suyu Pavilion)

420
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,780
Goodbye.

421
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,240
- Come back next time.
- Triplet.

422
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,540
Triplets.

423
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,620
This is awesome.

424
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,300
Had triplets.

425
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Right?

426
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,980
Yes.

427
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,620
This old lady must be so happy.

428
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,420
You know, triplets.

429
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,820
How amazing is that?

430
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,180
That's really fast.

431
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
It's not an ordinary person.

432
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,220
What did you two buy?

433
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,900
We bought a jade bracelet.

434
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,100
- A jade bracelet.
- A superior one.

435
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
Yes, a superior one.

436
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,740
Right.

437
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,660
Just next door.

438
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,620
That midwife told me.

439
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,140
It's triplets.

440
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,580
(Suyu Pavilion)

441
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,220
Just a few days ago.

442
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,860
Three at once.

443
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,940
Miss.

444
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,420
Your outfit looks really good.

445
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,700
Your hair accessories are also nice.

446
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,500
Is it newly bought?

447
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
Can I take a look?

448
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,060
This is Suyu Pavilion's new product
released today.

449
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,940
These must be kept strictly confidential.

450
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,660
Miss, don't take offense.

451
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,980
This hairpin suits your outfit perfectly.

452
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,140
I think so too. Thank you.

453
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
You're welcome.

454
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,940
(Isn't this hairpin designed
by Qipei Pavilion?)

455
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
(How did Suyu Pavilion release it first?)

456
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,700
Dandan.

457
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,060
Shuangshuang.

458
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,060
Why are you standing outside and not going in?

459
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,060
Shuangshuang, I have something to tell you.

460
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,620
- Let's go.
- It was not easy to give birth.

461
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,780
Really?

462
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,100
That was very dangerous.

463
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,780
Then I know.

464
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,420
What?

465
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
You went to Qipei Pavilion.

466
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,020
So I can't often see you at Suyu Pavilion.

467
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,980
After all, two families are in competition.

468
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
But you've offended Master Pei before.

469
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,020
How can you stay in Qipei Pavilion?

470
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,700
Shuangshuang, rest assured.

471
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,620
I have Madam covering me.

472
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,820
Madam gives me the opportunity to work hard.

473
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,180
Maybe I can represent Qipei Pavilion

474
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,980
in this Jade Competition.

475
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,740
I'm now a jade appraiser.

476
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,340
I'm still worried.

477
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,220
How can they let a little girl

478
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,220
represent Qipei Pavilion in the competition?

479
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,580
Is Mrs. Pei

480
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,260
having other intentions?

481
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,260
Mother, I disagree.

482
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,100
She's a spy sent by the Su family.

483
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,420
If you let her do the jade appraisal work...

484
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,700
Then you go for her.

485
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,860
I won't go.

486
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,660
(Madam just wants me)

487
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,820
(to handle Mr. Pei.)

488
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,900
(What else?)

489
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,500
Dandan.

490
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,780
Shuangshuang, don't worry.

491
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,260
Madam really likes me.

492
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,460
After all, I'm smart and capable.

493
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,700
Even if there's really any danger,

494
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,780
I can definitely turn it around

495
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,380
and retreat safely.

496
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,460
Rest assured.

497
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,340
Then you must remember to be careful.

498
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,980
Got it.

499
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,460
Are you hungry?

500
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,500
Let me take you to eat

501
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,620
your favorite, crabmeat balls.

502
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,180
No, I have other things to do today.

503
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,380
Other things?

504
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,940
Related to jade.

505
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,620
Time is running out.

506
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,700
Shuangshuang, I'm leaving.

507
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
Be careful.

508
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,660
How can there be such a pretty lady
in the world?

509
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
Shuangshuang.

510
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,300
Liu.

511
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,900
Perfect match.

512
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,220
Not a single.

513
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,300
Single...

514
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,740
Where's Dandan?

515
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,780
Dandan.

516
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,020
Hello, I'm Liu.

517
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,700
(Peace and Tranquility)

518
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,260
Her sister is a designer at Suyu Pavilion.

519
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,780
Yes.

520
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,500
Her name is Shan Shuangshuang.

521
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,260
She's really beautiful

522
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,220
with straight black hair.

523
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,860
She's tall too.

524
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,900
Young Master,

525
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,140
I heard that Su Jue particularly values her.

526
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,700
She was promoted to a formal designer

527
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,700
before completing her apprenticeship.

528
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,980
Young Master, do you think this is evidence?

529
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Why not?

530
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,140
Young Master, she must be a spy.

531
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,260
If Su Jue wants a spy,

532
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,620
wouldn't it be better for her sister to come?

533
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Shan Dandan

534
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,420
can work here

535
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,900
because my mother was momentarily pleased.

536
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,980
Why bother for Su Jue?

537
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,140
Young Master,

538
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,380
are you saying

539
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,820
she's not a spy?

540
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,460
Then should we continue watching her?

541
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,220
Fool.

542
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,700
Of course, we must continue the investigation.

543
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,610
Go and keep a close eye on her.

544
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,860
Young Master, it's time to eat.

545
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,340
The young master already has food.

546
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,140
Why are you here
to add unnecessary things?

547
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,780
Look at what you've made.

548
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,140
It's bland and watery.

549
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,020
It doesn't look appetizing at all.

550
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,780
The young master doesn't like
eggplant or braised pork.

551
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,900
He doesn't like heavy oil or salt.

552
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,740
He especially doesn't like drinking cold tea.

553
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,020
Did you know all this?

554
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,780
You...

555
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,900
You must be wondering how I know, right?

556
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,220
I checked the leftovers in the kitchen.

557
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,420
With a bit of attention,

558
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,460
it's not hard to find out.

559
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,900
A good maid

560
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,180
never misses any details.

561
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,220
What? Are you going to fight?

562
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,820
The young master is here.

563
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,980
Mind your manners.

564
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,460
But the menu

565
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,500
never changes.

566
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,460
This means you never asked for these things.

567
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,300
You don't care about it.

568
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,300
You usually just get by

569
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,340
with anything.

570
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,740
Don't worry. With me here,

571
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,700
this won't happen again.

572
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,500
I understand you.

573
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,220
Amazing.

574
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,060
Who?

575
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,860
It's me, Ms. Dandan.

576
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,220
Who are you?

577
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,940
I'm an apprentice at Qipei Pavilion.

578
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,220
My name is Yang Yuhuan.

579
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,260
I saw the workshop lights on.

580
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,420
So I came in to check.

581
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,380
What are you doing?

582
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,380
I'm thinking about the Jade Competition.

583
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,020
This is just a draft.

584
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,260
I need to discuss it with the masters.

585
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,820
But no one seems to trust me.

586
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,380
If you don't mind,

587
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,820
I'd like to help you.

588
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,380
They usually

589
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,180
don't let me do important tasks.

590
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,060
Really?

591
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,060
You're a heroin!

592
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,060
But

593
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,700
I'm not very skilled.

594
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,940
Don't be modest.

595
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,100
It's true.

596
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,980
Then how did you get into Qipei Pavilion?

597
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,500
During the interview,

598
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,380
I ate ten buns in one go.

599
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,420
Mr. Hao said that a big eater

600
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,540
brings good luck.

601
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,180
So he kept me.

602
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,220
(Oh, heavens.)

603
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,380
(Qipei Pavilion is unique indeed.)

604
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,460
Ms. Dandan.

605
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,360
(Never mind. Desperate times
call for desperate measures.)

606
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,060
(Some help is better than none.)

607
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,020
It's settled then.

608
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,420
I'll wait for you there

609
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,860
after work.

610
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,820
There?

611
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
Alright.

612
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,660
We can do this!

613
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,740
We can do this!

614
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,100
Young Master,

615
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,820
last night, someone saw

616
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,780
someone was helping her.

617
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,060
Someone was helping her?

618
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,460
Who?

619
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,780
Yang Yuhuan.

620
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,380
That girl from the workshop.

621
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,500
Yes.

622
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,900
Young Master,

623
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,460
should we have Mr. Hao fire her?

624
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,460
No need.

625
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,940
It's just unfortunate.

626
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,380
We'll waste some money again.

627
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,980
Dandan,

628
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,460
your idea of combining two bracelets

629
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,700
is excellent.

630
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,700
It's three-dimensional and innovative.

631
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,300
Start carving quickly.

632
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,740
Dandan,

633
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,300
why didn't we think

634
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,260
of intertwining the jade before?

635
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,340
Start carving.

636
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,700
- Dandan.
- Carve.

637
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,740
The third one.

638
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,980
Sorry.

639
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,260
My skills aren't up to your idea.

640
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,220
It's okay.

641
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,620
Just focus on practicing.

642
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,060
Leave the rest to me.

643
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,820
You don't blame me?

644
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,660
No, I don't.

645
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Mr. Hao,

646
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,580
could you give me more funds?

647
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,100
The material consumption is too high.

648
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,780
There's no more money.

649
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,980
How can there be no money?

650
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,380
Why not?

651
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,940
Young Master.

652
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,860
My mother let you join the jade appraisal

653
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,340
and design to bring in new ideas,

654
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,620
not to squander

655
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,540
the family's money.

656
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,100
Such waste.

657
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,420
If you're not a spy from the Su family,

658
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,580
then make do with the funds you have.

659
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,340
If that's not enough,

660
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,540
find another place to go.

661
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,980
Darn it, Pei Pei!

662
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,980
Always targeting me,

663
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,140
calling me a spy.

664
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,100
You only make things worse.

665
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,740
Whose turn is it?

666
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,660
- Your turn.
- Mine, mine.

667
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,660
Come on.

668
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,180
- Dandan.
- Seven dots.

669
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,580
I don't want it.

670
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,540
Dandan, come over.

671
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,060
Nine bamboos. What's this?

672
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,500
Take a look. Two dots.

673
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,900
Madam.

674
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,220
Hello, ladies.

675
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
Dandan,

676
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
should I take the two dots or not?

677
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,660
This...

678
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,140
Madam, this isn't appropriate.

679
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,620
If we win,

680
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,140
I'll share half with you.

681
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,820
Take it. You should take it.

682
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,420
Take it.

683
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,220
Alright, I'll take the two dots.

684
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,620
Green Dragon!

685
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,260
Six.

686
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,580
I won again.

687
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,500
You're lucky. It's you again.

688
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,540
Look at this.

689
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,940
Such good luck.

690
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,140
Really, look at that.

691
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,500
Alright, alright.

692
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,060
I'm tired.

693
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,460
Let's call it a day.

694
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,860
Dandan,

695
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,140
you won over 200 taels today, right?

696
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,060
Thanks to your blessing, madam.

697
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,260
Madam Pei,

698
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,380
you hired a strategist to win.

699
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,500
And now you want to run?

700
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,940
Not fair.

701
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,100
Exactly.

702
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,940
Ladies,

703
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,740
it's called steady gains.

704
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,620
In the future,

705
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,780
you'll win it back.

706
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,860
Besides,

707
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,340
you've been letting me win
because I'm not good.

708
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,860
Maybe next time,

709
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,660
you'll have unbeatable luck.

710
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,060
This girl can talk.

711
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,580
Look at her.

712
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,580
No, no. Another round.

713
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,620
One more round.

714
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,490
The last round, okay?

715
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,380
- Okay.
- Alright. I'll join you.

716
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
- Alright.
- One more round.

717
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,020
One more round.

718
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,140
Come on.

719
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,180
Come on.

720
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,660
Come on.

721
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,820
Let's play.

722
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,540
Madam Pei had such good luck today.

723
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,220
Young Master,

724
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,660
now Dandan has money again.

725
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,060
Do you think she'll design jade overnight?

726
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
What if...

727
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,980
I mean.

728
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,100
What if Madam likes her work?

729
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,460
Would she represent Qipei Pavilion

730
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
in the Jade Competition?

731
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,580
Young Master,

732
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,060
we might as well go all out.

733
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,580
Do you have no respect for the law?

734
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,420
Just joking with you.

735
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,540
Young Master,

736
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,020
this is for my later plan.

737
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,660
I have a great idea.

738
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,580
A beauty trap.

739
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,220
Her?

740
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,900
How can a toad eat swan meat?

741
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,820
Young Master,

742
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,020
I have to criticize you.

743
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,460
How can you belittle yourself?

744
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,820
Why would you call yourself a toad?

745
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
- I...
- That's not right.

746
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,300
Young Master.

747
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,180
You can't hurt me.

748
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,940
That girl is my personal maid.

749
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,460
Not being around me all day is improper.

750
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,380
You mean...

751
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,980
Madam hates

752
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,900
social climbers.

753
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,900
I'll let her see

754
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,660
if she misjudged.

755
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,260
You!

756
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,300
What's this?

757
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,780
What are you pretending for?

758
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,780
The young master asked me to give this to you.

759
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Clothes, jewelry, and makeup.

760
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,660
You little vixen.

761
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,180
What tricks are you using?

762
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,740
What tricks could I have?

763
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,620
Just

764
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,580
some irresistible charm.

765
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,060
A woman's charm

766
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,020
is destined by heaven.

767
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,900
Wretch!

768
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,220
Wretch!

769
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,380
Also.

770
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,340
Also?

771
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,340
The young master is really fond of me.

772
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,940
The young master wants you

773
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,580
to serve him tonight

774
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,180
to bathe him.

775
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,180
The young master specifically

776
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,820
wants you to wash him.
