23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,380
- What are you doing?
- Young Master.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,380
Are you deliberately looking for trouble?

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,660
Well...

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,500
It's a misunderstanding.

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,580
Misunderstanding.

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,500
It's a misunderstanding.

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,500
Just a misunderstanding.

30
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,860
You two are together?

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,140
Yes, yes, he's my servant.

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,680
It's his first time here.
He doesn't know the rules.

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,580
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,420
Why can't I come here?

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,940
I told you not to follow me.

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,140
When did you tell me?

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,620
Do you know how dangerous it is here?

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,700
What is a girl like you doing here?

39
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,140
And you dare to say that.

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,940
Isn't it all because of you?

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,140
Because of me?

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,740
Sirs.

43
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,020
It's indeed all a misunderstanding.

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,620
It's really his first time here.

45
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,580
Please be tolerant of him.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,020
(Cloud)
Please.

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,020
A jade pendant.

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,900
He's an official.

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,820
How did you get
the official jade pendant?

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,420
This is a gift from City Lord to me.

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,460
So they are afraid of the officials.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,700
Now that they know I am an official,

53
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,260
why don't they bring out the material

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,420
and let me have a look?

55
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,740
Okay.

56
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,260
It's the eagle catching chickens game.

57
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,380
What eagle? What chickens?

58
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,020
Why I don't understand their words?

59
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,860
The eagle is an official.
And they're the chickens.

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,420
Now I don't know if it's true.

61
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,500
What should we do?

62
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,540
Stop talking nonsense. Hit him.

63
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,540
Let's go.

64
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,500
- Hurry up.
- Stop.

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,980
- Go.
- Catch them.

66
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,820
Stop.

67
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,300
Kid, don't run!

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,250
Stop.

69
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,100
- Hurry, chase them!
- Let's go!

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,300
- Stop, don't run.
- Chase them!

71
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,860
Stop him!

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,780
You're throwing things.

73
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,180
Let's go, go.

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,100
Block him from the front.

75
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,140
Stop him!

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,540
Don't let him escape.

77
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,660
Stop.

78
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,900
- This way.
- Stop.

79
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,060
Surround him!

80
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,220
This way.

81
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,340
Stop! Don't run!

82
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,220
Go.

83
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,860
- Catch him.
- Hurry.

84
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,900
Stop, don't run.

85
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,540
Jue.

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,740
Something's wrong.

87
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,610
What's up?

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,220
Someone is causing trouble
in our black market.

89
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,020
What? Who?

90
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,420
Pei Pei.

91
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,140
Why did he go to the black market?

92
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,340
- I don't know either.
- (Oh no. Dandan.)

93
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,260
Hurry up.

94
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,460
Come on.

95
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,580
Get in.

96
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,660
Quick.

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,020
Go over there.

98
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,220
Catch him.

99
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,300
- Hurry.
- Don't let him escape.

100
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,340
Quick.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Come on.

102
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
You guys go over there.

103
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,620
- Where is him?
- The rest of you follow me.

104
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,780
- Go that way.
- Go there.

105
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,500
You...

106
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,900
What are you doing in the black market?

107
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,020
I just wanted to help you buy jade.

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,860
Help me?

109
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,900
Let's not talk about this for now.

110
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Better to think about

111
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,860
how can we escape.

112
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,020
Does it hurt?

113
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,940
It's nothing.

114
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,100
You just said you wanted to buy me jade.

115
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,820
I was thinking that normally...

116
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,060
What are you doing?

117
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,540
How dare you touch my butt?

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,260
Look where my hands are.

119
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,740
It's not you.

120
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Then this...

121
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,220
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- They are over here.

122
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,700
- Hurry up!
- Keep up.

123
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,900
- Catch him!
- Where do you think can run?

124
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,940
Surround him quickly!

125
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,860
Quick, quick, surround them!

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,540
- Stop him!
- Keep running!

127
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,180
You're not running anymore?

128
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,660
You won't get away from me!

129
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,140
What should we do?
Are we going to die here?

130
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,900
Don't worry, even though
I don't understand the jargon,

131
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,250
I am the Young Master of the Pei family.

132
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,180
The reinforcements are on their way,
just you wait.

133
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,450
Reinforcements?

134
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,380
I'll see who
your reinforcements are today.

135
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,740
Brothers, get him!

136
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Get him!

137
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,650
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

138
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,820
Make way.

139
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,700
- Excuse me.
- Make way.

140
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,650
- Make way, please.
- Excuse me.

141
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,700
Young Master, are you okay?

142
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Ms. Dandan, are you okay?

143
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,940
Who just saved us?

144
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,540
It was me, Young Master.

145
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,620
Me, Liu.

146
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,220
(Peace and Tranquility)

147
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,180
Be gentle.

148
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,780
It's so serious.

149
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,580
We should find a doctor.

150
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,740
No.

151
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,100
If we bring a doctor over,
my mother will know.

152
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,300
It's just a minor injury.

153
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,260
What if it gets worse?

154
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,300
What if it festers?

155
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,740
- What if it hit the bones?
- What if

156
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,340
I have the Jinchuang ointment?

157
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,500
Young Master.

158
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,500
Go ahead then.

159
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,420
Young Master.

160
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,460
No, I'm afraid of blood.

161
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
You do it, Ms. Dandan.

162
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,420
Go for it.

163
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,860
He wasn't like this just now.

164
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,820
Young Master, let me help you.

165
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,780
Okay.

166
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,940
Bear with it, it'll hurt a little.

167
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,980
Please rest assured, Madam.

191
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,100
I took a peek outside the room,

192
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,420
it's not serious.

193
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,940
Ms. Dandan is taking care of him.

194
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,940
Do you want to go check on him?

195
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,180
Forget it.

196
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,180
Dandan can stay with him.

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,340
Thank you.

198
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,220
You went to the black market
to help me find the jade?

199
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,260
No.

200
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,340
I...

201
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,420
Who did you hear it from?

202
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,820
How could that be possible?

203
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,300
You just told me that, didn't you?

204
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,700
Are you mistaken?

205
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,060
I don't remember saying it at all.

206
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,460
Young Master,

207
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,820
can you stop pretending?

208
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,380
You wanted to be nice to her,

209
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,180
but now you're all injured
and she doesn't appreciate it.

210
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,100
What are you up to?

211
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
I...

212
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,380
And Ms. Dandan,

213
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,600
Young Master went to the black market

214
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,060
just to find the Hotan jade for you

215
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,060
to make up for his mistake

216
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,380
that he caused your stone to be dropped.

217
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,260
Alright.

218
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Be careful with the wound.

219
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,100
Anyway, Ms. Dandan,

220
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,310
Young Master has put in a lot of effort

221
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,060
and suffered a lot for you.

222
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,260
Okay, okay, you can go out now.

223
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,740
Got it.

224
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,860
Don't overthink it.

225
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,580
I'm not just helping you.

226
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,420
I just think that if you
represent our Qipei Pavilion

227
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,060
to win the Jade Competition,

228
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,620
I could continue

229
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,820
enjoying my life at the mansion.

230
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,740
Thank you.

231
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,060
What?

232
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,420
The black market has been shut down?

233
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,580
How could this happen?

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,660
They have been wanting
to investigate it for so many years,

235
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,380
but we have never left any evidence.

236
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,180
It must be Pei Pei.

237
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,860
He caused a scene in the black market
under the guise of buying jade

238
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,500
and exposed the private goods

239
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,060
of those underground stall owners.

240
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,860
The authorities caught them in the act.

241
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,220
So you're saying

242
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,060
right after
the illegal goods were exposed,

243
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,460
the officials arrived.

244
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,780
What about our men in the black market?

245
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,700
They didn't notice it?

246
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,860
It's because Pei Pei

247
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,020
had someone injure our men,

248
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,180
and then got the officials there.

249
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,540
In this way,

250
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,140
our business
will definitely suffer a heavy blow.

251
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,500
Back then, the Pei family
had been oppressing us,

252
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,820
but luckily me and your father had...

253
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,100
What?

254
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,700
(It's related to the crown.)

255
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,580
Had...

256
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,820
Had some new skills

257
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,060
so we surpassed the Pei family.

258
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,500
- Young Master.
- Come in.

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,900
Young Master, there's an urgent matter.

260
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,060
What's up?

261
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,420
The Pei family got the jade mine

262
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,940
in the western mountain
of the suburbs first.

263
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,980
What?

264
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,860
Didn't I already offer twice the price?

265
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,660
It's because of my incompetence.

266
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,100
The jade expert from the Pei family

267
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,750
has been friends
with the mine owner for ten years.

268
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,820
It was my negligence.

269
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,060
Loser!

270
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,820
This darn Pei family.

271
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,820
It was our negligence.

272
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,100
The jade mine is not top-grade.

273
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,540
Just let them have it.

274
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,820
Unfortunately,

275
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,980
the black market has been
operated by your father for years.

276
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,500
But Pei Pei completely destroyed it.

277
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,820
Pei Pei.

278
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,220
I will make him pay for it.

279
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Let's discuss the jade mine issue later.

280
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,460
We need to figure out a solution

281
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,260
to retrieve those black market goods

282
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,740
from the government's hands.

283
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,900
This incident

284
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,540
was instigated by Pei Pei,

285
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,540
and I have always been at odds with him.

286
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,020
It means these years,

287
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
they have been watching our every move.

288
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
It's our negligence.

289
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,860
So he took advantage of it.

290
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,180
I will go investigate.

291
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,460
I'd like to see

292
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,100
who has the courage

293
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,340
to dare to sell the Su family out.

294
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,060
Come with me to find some people.

295
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,300
Let's teach them a lesson first.

296
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
(Secret room.)

297
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,980
Deliver this to Mr. Su's room.

298
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,940
Yes.

299
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,580
(Pei's Mansion)

300
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,100
Good morning, Young Master.

301
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,780
Did you sleep well last night?

302
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,340
Why are you here?

303
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,180
At this hour,

304
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,540
I'm supposed to deliver food to you.

305
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,460
I won't eat. My hand hurts.

306
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,500
Young Master.

307
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,460
You have been injured for a long time.

308
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
It's not recovered yet?

309
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,900
Why are you so talkative?

310
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,740
Get someone
to help me change the dressing.

311
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,540
Alright, I will go find a doctor now.

312
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,500
Are you stupid?

313
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,860
My injury is almost healed.

314
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,820
Why get the doctor?

315
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,460
Young Master.

316
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,700
I don't know much about medicine

317
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,940
and am a bit clumsy.

318
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,700
If I hurt you,

319
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,340
just bear with it.

320
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,260
Didn't Young Master say

321
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,260
his hand injury is almost healed?
Don't worry so much.

322
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,860
Young Master,
I'll go get Ms. Dandan here.

323
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,540
Young Master.

324
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,900
No.

325
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,340
Ms. Dandan has been busy these days.

326
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,540
What is she busy with?

327
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,060
She got a good piece of jade

328
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,620
from the black market.

329
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,740
Many craftsmen want to join her team

330
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,900
for the good material.

331
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,420
I also heard that

332
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,300
she made a great contribution
to our workshop.

333
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,620
Contribution?

334
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,620
Young Master.

335
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,380
How about I do it instead?

336
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,140
Young Master.

337
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,020
Have you taken care of
everything in the room?

338
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,780
You've been running
to the workshop all day long.

339
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,020
I'm really sorry, Young Master.

340
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,140
I have been really busy lately.

341
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,220
The matters of the room

342
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,740
can only be handled by Cuiliu.

343
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,020
But I have told her

344
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,180
and she is very willing.

345
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,420
She is willing?

346
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,620
Did you ask me whether I'm willing?

347
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
Liu.

348
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,300
Let's go

349
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
check out the workshop.

350
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,260
Okay.

351
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,420
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

352
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,340
Go, go, go.

353
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,180
Please come in, Young Master.

354
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,550
- Hello, Ms. Dandan.
- Young Master.

355
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,420
Young Master.

356
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,660
Hello, Ms. Dandan. Young Master.

357
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,300
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

358
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,660
When did you become so popular?

359
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,860
Not very much.

360
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,500
What are you guys happy about?

361
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,450
Young Master.

362
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,500
Ms. Dandan has done us a favor.

363
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,180
It's nothing.

364
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,580
According to the jade sales
of Yuncui City

365
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,700
in the fourth quarter,

366
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,660
the sales volume

367
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,340
of Hetian jade and jadeite
has been declining,

368
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,460
but Nanhong red agate and white jade

369
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,340
have become the favorite
of the distinguished officials.

370
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,940
So I proposed to the shopkeeper

371
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,940
to change the sales strategy.

372
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,540
The sales volume will increase rapidly.

373
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,500
So

374
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,020
we received a lot of bonuses.

375
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,740
Although

376
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,750
I don't really want to praise you,

377
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,140
your business acumen is quite good.

378
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,260
I'm just a maid,

379
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,940
contributed a little
to the career of Qipei Pavilion.

380
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,300
As the Young Master,

381
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,700
you can do much more.

382
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,740
This is too difficult to carve.

383
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,660
What's up?

384
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,620
Young Master.

385
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,780
I have tried it for an afternoon.

386
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,260
The newly acquired red agate
is too difficult to carve.

387
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,040
The red agate has low density
and low hardness.

388
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,100
Its glossiness is also poor.

389
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
Use the size 12 knife

390
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,180
and use only 70% of the strength.

391
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
Young Master, it worked.

392
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,580
This size 12 knife is very suitable.

393
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,380
Young Master, you are really amazing.

394
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,580
I just have some talent.

395
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,740
Why don't you participate
in the Jade Competition?

396
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,300
I can tell that
you are hiding your strength.

397
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,300
If the two of us team up,

398
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,820
we can definitely bring forth new ideas.

399
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,180
I'll take care of you while I'm at it.

400
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,420
Isn't this a win-win situation?

401
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,580
I...

402
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,260
I'm not interested.

403
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,620
Young Master.

404
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
Young Master.

405
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Young Master is so talented.

406
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,700
But instead of studying jade in the room,

407
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
he always fishes here every day.

408
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,860
Because he is suffering in his heart.

409
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,460
Madam.

410
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,860
My Pei

411
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,500
is not like what you usually see him.

412
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,660
He was the most talented and hardworking

413
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,700
jade carver in Yuncui City.

414
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,140
But many years ago,

415
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,740
he got involved in a tragedy.

416
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,740
He was heartbroken

417
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,580
and swore not to touch the family's

418
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,900
jade and jewelry business again,

419
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,380
only being a carefree young master.

420
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
Sit, Dandan.

421
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,740
Madam.

422
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

423
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,260
Those who know these things

424
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,180
have all advised him,

425
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,900
but he doesn't want others
to mention it,

426
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
let alone talk him out of it.

427
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,620
So I'm thinking

428
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,020
maybe someone who doesn't know the past

429
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,500
can help him get rid of that pain.

430
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
I have always followed
his father's wishes,

431
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,110
thinking that without talent or ability,

432
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,180
I can keep him safe.

433
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,060
But now that I am old,

434
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,540
how long can I continue to protect him?

435
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,660
Even if I have to force him,

436
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,420
I need to get him back on his feet.

437
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,300
The Qipei Pavilion must not fall.

438
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,060
Madam,

439
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,660
may I ask what happened back then?

440
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,620
That is a scar in his heart.

441
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,540
He still refuses to mention it.

442
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,700
Just pretend it never happened.

443
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,780
But now,

444
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,580
I see hope again.

445
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,060
Hope?

446
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
You.

447
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,380
You are the hope.

448
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,820
Me?

449
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,820
Girl,

450
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,260
I like you from the bottom of my heart.

451
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,100
If you can really change Pei Pei,

452
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,500
then it must be

453
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,020
heaven

454
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,020
that brought you to me.

455
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,540
(Ingenious Workmanship)

456
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
Top-grade ice species.

457
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Top-grade Hetian jade.

458
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,220
You decide the material

459
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,420
for this Jade Competition.

460
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,020
Let's settle on this piece of ice type.

461
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,340
Transparent and smooth.

462
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,260
It can create the best jade product.

463
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,460
Okay, I'll listen to you.

464
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,060
I wonder what

465
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,020
you want to create this time.

466
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,940
A jade mandarin duck ornament.

467
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,340
Mandarin duck?

468
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,420
Right.

469
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,660
After winning the championship,

470
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,460
I will give it to you as a gift.

471
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
On the turquoise water,

472
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,460
we'd be mandarin ducks
swimming wing to wing.

473
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,940
Mr. Su, you are exaggerating.

474
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,420
I really can't afford it.

475
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,420
You are being modest again.

476
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,440
If I say you deserve it,

477
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
then you deserve it.

478
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,140
Does she?

479
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,900
Yes, yes.

480
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,300
Aren't you going to the outskirts
to inspect goods today?

481
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,900
I almost forgot.

482
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,420
I'll leave you now.

483
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,660
Get back to your work.

484
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,320
- Yes.
- Okay.

485
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,310
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

486
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,460
Liu.

487
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,060
Dandan, what's wrong?

488
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,760
- I have a question for you.
- Sure.

489
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,310
I heard that the result
of the Jade Competition

490
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,100
will have a significant impact, right?

491
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,580
Of course.

492
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,780
This Jade Competition
only happens once in a while.

493
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,340
And our City Lord

494
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,060
and masters from various places

495
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,780
will be the judges.

496
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,020
The champion

497
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,820
will be the Chief Jade Master,

498
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,020
enjoying a high status

499
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,700
and will be respected
by all the vendors and common people.

500
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,060
Of course it's important.

501
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,820
No wonder Suyu Pavilion
doesn't do any promotion,

502
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,820
but their business is much better
than our Qipei Pavilion.

503
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,980
Of course.

504
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,100
Su Jue has won the championship

505
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,260
for two consecutive sessions,

506
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,020
that's why he's usually so arrogant.

507
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,620
Didn't Young Master participate as well?

508
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,460
Yes, he participated many years ago.

509
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,540
It seems like there was some accident

510
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,540
so he quit the competition.

511
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,260
And then the last competition.

512
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,740
I was blue in the face

513
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,380
but Young Master
still didn't want to participate.

514
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,380
In the end,

515
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,020
Madam had to randomly pick a few works

516
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,060
for the competition.

517
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,700
What exactly happened back then?

518
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,980
I can tell

519
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,900
Young Master is intentionally
avoiding jade carving.

520
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,700
Well...

521
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
Come on, tell me.

522
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,340
I'll help you.

523
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,020
Dandan.

524
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,980
I suddenly remembered

525
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,340
there are still two pieces of clothing
in my room that haven't been washed.

526
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,180
I'll go get them.

527
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,620
You can ask Young Master yourself.

528
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,820
If I can ask him directly,

529
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
why do I still need you?

530
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,540
(This Su family is really not simple.)

531
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,700
(Gold beads
inlaid with gold wire and jade)

532
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,380
(Strange.)

533
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,300
(Why is there only one drawing?)

534
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,740
Still at a loss?

535
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,660
Just with one drawing,

536
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,660
and the teachings of my father,

537
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,380
it's too hard to master

538
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,740
all the skills of the crown.

539
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,540
What a pity.

540
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,580
The crown is nowhere to be found.

541
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,820
Who actually took it away back then?

542
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,060
We've understood part of

543
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,820
the techniques on the crown.

544
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,140
And the current strength
of our Su family

545
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,420
is beyond the reach of other families.

546
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,980
Moreover,

547
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,980
the Pei family was able
to make the crown back then

548
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,620
because they combined
the skills of many craftsmen.

549
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,940
Their own technique alone

550
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,100
is not enough to threaten us.

551
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,820
And Pei Pei

552
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,900
is a weak opponent.

553
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,100
He's quit the jade business long ago.

554
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,260
So

555
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,060
no need to worry.

556
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,380
(Why the crown
that was presented as tribute back then)

557
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,820
(is not in the Su family?)

558
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
(How could it be?)

559
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,220
Shuangshuang.

560
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,300
Someone trapped me.

561
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,300
- The amber on the crown is not medicine.
- Dad.

562
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,260
- Dad.
- I was too foolish.

563
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,260
You must protect yourself well

564
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
and never seek revenge.

565
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,220
(I am lurking in
the most suspicious Su family)

566
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,900
(but still found no clue.)

567
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,220
(Could it really be that it was
an inside job of the Pei family?)

568
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,940
Pei.

569
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,740
Are you really not considering

570
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,460
joining this year's Jade Competition?

571
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,220
No.

572
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,100
It's been so long.

573
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,020
- Are you...
- Stop it, Mom.

574
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,820
Why don't you participate
in the Jade Competition?

575
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,100
I can tell you're hiding your talent.

576
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,100
If the two of us team up,

577
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,540
we can definitely bring forth new ideas.

578
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,300
As the Young Master of the Pei family,

579
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,260
you only watch Madam struggling.

580
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,860
You clearly know everything,

581
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,020
but you did nothing.

582
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,820
Young Master,

583
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
aren't you

584
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,140
a loser?

585
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Don't try to persuade me.

586
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,420
I'm not drunk.

587
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,940
Who's trying to persuade you?

588
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm here to drink with you.

589
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,380
Are you crazy?

590
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,100
Drinking like this,
you're seeking death.

591
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,020
You know that drinking like this
is not healthy,

592
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,340
and you still do that.

593
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,660
Look at the moon.

594
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,100
It seems very bright,

595
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,780
but it does not have any light of its own

596
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,860
and cannot illuminate the earth.

597
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,460
Just like me.

598
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,100
I look like living an extravagant life,

599
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,940
but actually,

600
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,100
in my heart,

601
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,620
there has long been no light at all.

602
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

603
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,860
You have no idea
how envious I am of you.

604
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Envy me?

605
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,700
Why?

606
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,740
Because I was born with a silver spoon?

607
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,740
Shan Dandan.

608
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,260
I didn't expect you to be so mundane.

609
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,020
No.

610
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,380
I

611
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,180
envy your talent.

612
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,460
You have a good taste

613
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,980
and is goot at carving.

614
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,820
Just a few comments of yours

615
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,860
can improve others' work.

616
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,740
I'm just so envious.

617
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,700
I wonder what other surprises

618
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,140
you're hiding.

619
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,660
You're so capable.

620
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,660
Why don't you do it yourself?

621
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,620
I can see that you are very talented.

622
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,380
You just pretend not to care about it.

623
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,340
I don't know
what happened to you before,

624
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,700
but I do know

625
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,380
there are many people around you
who love you,

626
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,620
and care about you.

627
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,580
Even I...

628
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,260
Even I hope

629
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,660
the best for you.

630
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,220
So is there anything
that can't be solved

631
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,820
and makes you want to escape?

632
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,340
Yes.

633
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,340
The person you know now

634
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
is not the same person I used to be.

635
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,940
(Young Pei Pei)
Dad, I will definitely win.

636
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,700
You will, you will.

637
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,060
The technique of this work

638
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
resembles that Moonlight Crown.

639
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,660
The Moonlight Crown is a masterpiece,

640
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,220
a collection of famous craftsmanship.

641
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,940
Pei is still a kid.

642
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,940
He just carved that randomly.

643
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,020
It's irrelevant to the crown.

644
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,420
The lost crown

645
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,740
hasn't been found.

646
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,100
Rumor has it that our Pei family

647
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,460
stole it from our digs

648
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,580
just to learn the techniques
and take the treasures of the crown.

649
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,060
Don't say such words in the future

650
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,700
in case of bringing trouble.

651
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,500
Look, the jade carved by Pei.

652
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,500
There is no need to prepare
for the Jade Competition.

653
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,780
I have already dropped you out.

654
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,900
Why?

655
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,780
I want to participate.

656
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,660
No reason.

657
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,020
Just do what I said.

658
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,980
And, don't touch jade again!

659
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,060
What are you doing?

660
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,300
Why can Su Jue participate

661
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,500
but I can't?

662
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,620
You are just afraid of the Su family.

663
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,020
You coward.

664
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,260
Wimp.

665
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,260
But I am not.

666
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,340
What are you doing?

667
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,100
- Who are you?
- Don't move.

668
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,980
What do you want to do?

669
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,820
What do I want?

670
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,810
Of course, to disable your hand.

671
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,460
Three bones are broken,

672
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,620
and the positions of the cuts
are all crooked.

673
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,140
After new bones grow,

674
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,620
he can care for himself,

675
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,300
but

676
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,900
I'm afraid he can't
write and carve anymore.

677
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,900
Okay, I got it.

678
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,340
I'm leaving.

679
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,580
Mom.

680
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,100
- My hand hurts.
- Pei.

681
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,220
It doesn't matter.

682
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,980
Though with no talent or ability,

683
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,100
at least I can keep him safe.

684
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,140
Since then,

685
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,940
I have never done jade carving again.

686
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,140
My father passed away,

687
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,340
and Mom handled

688
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,940
the entire business alone.

689
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,220
And as for me,

690
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,740
not only did I not help,

691
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,700
I deliberately avoided it

692
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:51,220
and became a total loser.

693
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,700
Isn't this what he wanted me to do?

694
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,660
But hearing you say that,

695
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,860
I find it strange.

696
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,540
Did Master Pei

697
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,460
have some difficulties?

698
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,180
What difficulties

699
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,300
could make him destroy his own son?

700
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,580
He didn't destroy you.

701
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,260
You are doing well now.

702
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,460
I saw your talent.

703
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,340
So as long as you are willing,

704
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,380
you're the best version of yourself.

705
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,580
So many years have passed.

706
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,660
Now you are the only man
in the Pei family,

707
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,460
so you must pull yourself together.

708
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,740
Do not disappoint Madam Pei.

709
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,980
The best version of myself.

710
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
The best version of yourself.

711
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,380
So you must promise me

712
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,780
to pull yourself together
starting from tomorrow.

713
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,980
Pinky promise.
