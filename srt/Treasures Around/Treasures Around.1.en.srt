Mr. Pei.

26
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,470
You're here again, Mr. Pei.

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,230
Is what you said true?

28
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,310
Of course.

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,470
Look at the color.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Look at the transparency.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,060
Look at the craftsmanship.

Back in the day,

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,010
Qipei Pavilion was unmatched.

36
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,680
Had some things to do.
Just got here today.

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,270
Mr. Pei, you're here.

38
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,070
These two tables' drinks are on me.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,710
Look at Mr. Pei.

40
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,200
Always treating you to drinks.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,950
Thank Mr. Pei.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,470

Look at the quality of this jade.

I really want it.

48
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140

59

Ms. Huadian, do you like it?

60
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,330
Yes.

61
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,500
Then I'll buy it for you.

62
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,940
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
- This...
- My family name is Shan.

64
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,870
Doesn't matter.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,230
Can you let me have this jade pendant?

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,170
Don't worry.

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,370
I won't

68
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,750
let you suffer a loss.

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,100
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

70
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,860
I really like it.

71
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,540
Honestly,

72
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,980
this jade pendant is the only thing

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,180
left by my late fiancé.

74
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,130
Take it.

75
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,500
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

76
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,500
Like it?

77
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,690
Yes.

78
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,930
Great.

79
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,540
Look how beautiful this jade pendant is.

80
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,130
I heard there's good jade for sale here.

81
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,370
Who are you? Wrong place?

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,500
I just heard from this lady.

83
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,500
She seems very familiar with Qipei Pavilion.

84
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,330
But why do I feel this jade pendant

85
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,620
is just...

86
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,620
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,220
Let me tell you. I'll buy this jade pendant.

88
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,860
Huadian likes it. I'm happy.

89
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,220
Let's go, Huadian.

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,530
Don't let me see you again.

91
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,940
Take care, sir.

92
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
Crazy.

93
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,250
Did you enter the wrong room?

94
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,820
No.

95
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,010
I came to find you.

96
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,530
I'll have the maid clean the room.

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,340
No need.

98
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,610
I don't mind.

99
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,890
The girl next door, Chunyu,

100
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,860
dances better than me.

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,100
She sings more songs too.

102
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,010
Shall I invite her to serve you?

103
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,620
What Chunyu?

104
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm not interested.

105
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,170
I'm here for the jade.

106
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,460
(A business opportunity delivered to my door.)

107
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,620
(No reason not to earn this money.)

108
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,340
Sir.

109
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,220
You came to the right place.

110
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,130
Come.

111
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,220
I can tell

112
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,580
you love and understand jade.

113
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,740
Look at this jade.

114
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,650
Look at the color, the transparency.

115
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
It's extraordinary.

116
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,100
This is Qipei Pavilion's former...

117
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,940
Stop.

118
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,530
This jade pendant.

119
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,650
I can buy it.

120
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,700
And I'll buy as many as you have.

121
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,610
Alright.

122
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,700
But

123
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,580
this is an art house.

124
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,980
If you serve me well,

125
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,220
everything else will be easy to discuss.

126
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,850
What do you want?

127
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,460
Dance for me.

128
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,370
Dance?

129
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,250
I'm new here.

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,650
I can't dance yet.

131
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,820
Not fully trained?

132
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,050
Bring Madam Yang here.

133
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,130
No, no.

134
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,460
Don't bother Madam Yang with everything.

135
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
It's not good.

136
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,990
Dance.

137
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,980
(Little liar.)

138
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,370
(Let's see how long you can keep this act up.)

139
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,100
(Rogue, what do you want?)

140
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm really going to dance.

141
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,820
Dance then.

142
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,700
No, no. Stop, stop.

143
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,050
Stop, stop.

144
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,250
You better not dance.

145
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,090
Really.

146
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,730
Then

147
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,620
sing a song.

148
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,860
Sing a song?

149
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,220
Can't dance

150
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,290
or sing.

151
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,580
Looks like I really need to call Madam Yang.

152
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,530
No, no.

153
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,250
I do know one song.

154
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,730
Which one?

155
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,170
The song about evil lust.

156
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,980
Madam Yang, someone here...

157
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,180
Shh.

158
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,300
Madam Yang!

159
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,890
Shh.

160
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,250
I told you to keep it down.

161
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,610
Forget it.

162
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,980
Then

163
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,460
take off your clothes.

164
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,780
(Liu, Pei Pei's attendant)

165
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,220
Look, a bunch of customers.

166
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,540
Not good.

167
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,220
What's going on?

168
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,940
Who is this?

169
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,830
(Flower Pavilion)
Hurry, hurry.

170
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,300
The Madam is coming to catch him.

171
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,140
Yes.

172
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,900
What?

173
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Do you need help undressing?

174
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,220
This is an art house, not a brothel.

175
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,580
I sell art, not my body.

176
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,340
You can't sing or dance.

177
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,300
What kind of artist are you?

178
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,660
I'm done serving you.

179
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,340
Pretending to be an artist.

180
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,940
Actually luring customers to buy jade.

181
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,580
Then selling these inferior goods.

182
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,060
You don't understand. Don't talk nonsense.

183
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,660
This is top-quality jade.

184
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,220
Top quality?

185
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,540
This is made from low-grade material.

186
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,940
This southern red jade bracelet
is a failed piece.

187
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
And this hairpin.

188
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,180
This is fake jade.

189
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,340
Smells of alum.

190
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,340
And you call this good stuff?

191
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,500
You...

192
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,860
If you don't like it, don't like it.

193
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,540
Why say so much?

194
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
Looking at this craftsmanship.

195
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,420
There should be leftovers

196
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,980
from Suyu Pavilion.

197
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Dare to sell these things to me?

198
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,220
You cheated the wrong person.

199
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,060
I...

200
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,060
Tell me.

201
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,580
Were you sent by Suyu Pavilion?

202
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,580
- Move.
- You are...

203
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,180
No, no relation to Suyu Pavilion.

204
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,820
I just sell these to make some money.

205
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,220
Alright. I know I was wrong.

206
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,540
Sorry, sorry.

207
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,580
You're magnanimous.

208
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,820
Don't hold it against a little girl.

209
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,940
(Madam Pei Qin, Qipei Pavilion's Master)

210
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,540
Madam.

211
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,460
He's upstairs.

212
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,420
Young Master.

213
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,980
Hello, hello, Young Master.

214
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,420
Why are you shouting?

215
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,660
Do you want everyone to know I'm here?

216
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,820
I saw the Madam at the door.

217
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
What?

218
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,220
Why didn't you say earlier? Let's go.

219
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,700
- Okay.
- Young Master.

220
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,700
Where are you going?

221
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,820
Young Master, there's no time.

222
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
Move aside, please.

223
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,540
Since you're here,

224
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,940
just sit down.

225
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
Sit down.

226
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,220
Young Master, didn't you want to hear me sing?

227
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,420
I'll sing for you.

228
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
Let go of me.

229
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,980
Get her off me.

230
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,740
You, you, you. Let go.

231
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,940
Let go.

232
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,180
I find...

233
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,060
Let go.

234
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,940
What do I have to do to make you let me go?

235
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,380
Buy them.

236
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,820
Too late, Young Master.

237
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,460
- Hurry.
- Give her ten taels of silver.

238
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,300
Fifty taels.

239
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,180
Fifty taels? Why don't you go rob?

240
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,060
My dear.

241
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,460
Someone is coming to catch you.

242
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,340
- Give it to her.
- If you leave, what should I do?

243
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,220
- But...
- Give her.

244
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,060
Don't shout, don't shout.

245
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,900
Don't shout. Be quiet.

246
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,860
Here.

247
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,940
Thank you, Young Master.

248
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,060
Don't let me see you again.

249
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,380
- Young Master, goodbye.
- Let's go.

250
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

251
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,820
- Go, go, go.
- You don't know, Young Master.

252
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,580
As soon as I saw the Madam, I ran over.

253
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,700
- Young Master.
- Can you be more reliable?

254
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,220
I am reliable.

255
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,460
Who wants to see you?

256
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,380
Madam.

257
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Young Master has never been treated like this.

258
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
I didn't expect

259
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,940
someone to teach him a lesson for me.

260
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,740
(Li Guixiang, Madam Pei's maid)

261
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,700
This girl

262
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
is interesting.

263
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,700
Like you when you were young.

264
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,700
Fearless like a newborn calf.

265
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,860
These jades.

266
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,300
- Oh, no.
- Sir, are you okay?

267
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,980
- Where did this wild girl come from?
- I'm fine.

268
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,860
Watch where you're going.

269
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,420
Who are you calling blind?

270
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,820
I tell you.

271
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
These are tribute jewelry from Qipei Pavilion.

272
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,340
(Pei Chufeng, Qipei Pavilion's Master)
If they're damaged, you'll be in trouble.

273
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,460
Do you know who you bumped into?

274
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,060
The master of Qipei Pavilion.

275
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,660
You...

276
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,340
You're Pei Chufeng?

277
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,180
Since you're Pei Chufeng,

278
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,940
you should be more worried

279
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,340
about damaging your own jewelry.

280
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,820
Why are you acting so arrogant now?

281
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,340
Allowing your attendant to bully a little girl.

282
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,820
- What sense does that make?
- You...

283
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,340
Do you want to be fired?

284
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,380
Doesn't matter.

285
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,660
Without me,

286
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,220
it's your family's loss.

287
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,580
You, stop.

288
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,180
(Unifon)

289
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,900
Please come in.

290
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,660
(Suyu Pavilion Jade Shop,
Fine Gold and Good Jade)

291
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,860
This jade is excellent. Top quality.

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,380
Shopkeeper, the bill.

293
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,260
Ms. Dandan.

294
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,740
You sold the goods so quickly.

295
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,900
The jade pendant from last time is sold.

296
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,220
Looks like you made quite a profit.

297
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,980
How much I make is none of your business.

298
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,700
I only pay the set price.

299
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,700
Calculate it.

300
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,860
Alright.

301
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,780
I'll calculate.

302
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,140
Tell me.

303
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,780
Which jade has been selling best recently?

304
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,180
(Shan Shuangshuang, Suyu Pavilion's craftsman)
Red jade and Hetian jade are selling very well.

305
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,660
For example, this red jade.

306
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,860
- The texture is very...
- Dandan.

307
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,740
I know.

308
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,740
Thanks.

309
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,980
- Shuangshuang.
- Why are you here?

310
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
I...

311
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,380
Went to Flower Pavilion again?

312
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,740
You're a girl. It's too dangerous.

313
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,900
Alright, Shuangshuang.

314
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,780
The shopkeeper just raised my monthly salary.

315
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,420
Take it and buy something nice.

316
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,260
Suyu Pavilion is really generous.

317
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,140
But I'm grown up now.

318
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,140
I can't take your money.

319
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,860
Shuangshuang, you keep it for yourself.

320
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,820
You're my only sister.

321
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,220
Of course, I'll spend my money on you.

322
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,260
Wait until I hang in there a bit longer.

323
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,580
My monthly salary will increase again.

324
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,540
Suyu Pavilion is really nice.
I want to work there too.

325
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,420
No way.

326
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,820
I can't bear to see you suffer.

327
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,780
Ms. Dandan, I'm done.

328
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,460
Shuangshuang, wait for me.

329
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,500
It's 60 taels short.

330
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,940
Good.

331
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,500
- Shuangshuang.
- Listen to me.

332
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,580
Hurry back.

333
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,660
Don't run around anymore.

334
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm leaving then.

335
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,220
(Dandan,)

336
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,820
(Suyu Pavilion is such a dangerous place.)

337
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,460
(It's enough for me to be there alone.)

338
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,940
(I can't let you take the risk.)

339
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,700
Shopkeeper.

340
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,180
I need a favor.

341
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,260
I want to be a jade appraiser at Suyu Pavilion.

342
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,540
I'll do anything.

343
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,500
Even if you can't get me a job,

344
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,260
just give me a chance to be introduced.

345
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,820
My master will attend

346
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,020
the auction on East Street.

347
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,940
I can take you there.

348
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,060
Then it's up to you.

349
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,260
Alright.

350
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,100
Shopkeeper, you're so kind.

351
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,860
You'll live a long and happy life.

352
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm off then.

353
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,420
Bye.

354
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,580
Young Master, have you ever thought

355
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,020
this pomegranate can't be peeled?

356
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,420
Young Master.

357
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,980
What's wrong with you?

358
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,220
Don't ask.

359
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,860
It's bad luck.

360
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,060
(Cuiliu, Pei's Mansion's maid)

361
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,900
Liu.

362
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,740
When the young master goes out, I can't follow.

363
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
How did you take care of him?

364
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,300
What can I do?

365
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,860
Should I hit a woman?

366
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,140
A woman?

367
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,220
Don't mention this again.

368
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,900
You're useless. Can't do anything right.

369
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Young Master.

370
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,660
Did you go to Flower Pavilion again?

371
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,500
What?

372
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,900
Are you prying into my private affairs now?

373
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,860
Young Master is joking again.

374
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,980
How dare I pry into your private matters?

375
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,900
The Madam earned all this wealth.

376
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,780
Just to let the young master enjoy life.

377
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,180
Besides,

378
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,380
when you go out for fun,

379
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,580
I can still serve you when you return.

380
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,340
Hey.

381
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,860
Who let you sit here?

382
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,820
I think

383
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,740
you want him to marry you, right?

384
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,940
Madam.

385
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,300
Mother, why are you here?

386
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,780
A maid speaking and acting

387
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,540
so improperly, with no manners.

388
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,820
I think we need a new one.

389
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,740
Madam, I'm sorry.

390
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,900
I just wanted to make the young master happy.

391
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,420
Please don't drive me away.

392
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,380
Pei.

393
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,860
Are you not participating

394
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,380
in this year's Jade Competition?

395
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,660
No.

396
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,100
Mother,

397
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,380
I don't understand jade.

398
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,420
I'm not interested.

399
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,540
It's been so many years.

400
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,380
Mother.

401
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,940
If there's nothing else,

402
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,740
I'll go out to play.

403
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,100
Liu, let's go.

404
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,180
Pei.

405
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,780
Pei.

406
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,740
I'm not finished talking.

407
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,580
Young Master.

408
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,620
Pei.

409
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,140
Watch your manners.

410
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,220
- Mr. Su.
- Mr. Pei.

411
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,060
Mr. Su is here.

412
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,940
Mr. Pei.

413
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,620
Mr. Pei.

414
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,740
It's been years since you cared

415
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,460
about jade carving and family business.

416
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,460
(Su Jue, Suyu Pavilion's Master)
Why are you interested

417
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,780
in coming here today?

418
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
Firstly,

419
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,860
looking for something new and fun.

420
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,980
Secondly,

421
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,700
to snatch what you want

422
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,340
and dampen your spirits.

423
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,140
Little Qipei Pavilion may not be strong,

424
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,500
but it talks big.

425
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,420
Let's see then.

426
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,420
Young Master.

427
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,580
You'll all go later.

428
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,500
Shopkeeper.

429
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,620
Ms. Dandan.

430
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,500
This way, please.

431
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,060
I found a great spot for you.

432
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,580
Here, you can see everything.

433
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,180
Did Mr. Su come?

434
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,500
Mr. Su is upstairs.

435
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,580
(This guy again.)

436
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,220
Ms. Dandan.

437
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,260
You can bid for Suyu Pavilion.

438
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,540
But if you make a mistake,

439
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,420
and the price is high,

440
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,820
you'll pay for it.

441
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,020
No problem. I'm ready for this.

442
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Alright.

443
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,820
I must tell you. These are...

444
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,500
Young Master, look at that girl.

445
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,140
Is the guy next to her from Suyu Pavilion?

446
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,700
She's indeed from Suyu Pavilion.

447
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,980
What do we do now?

448
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,140
Follow her bids

449
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,100
- and teach her a lesson.
- Alright.

450
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,980
Be sure to win.

451
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,060
Got it.

452
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,060
Leave it to me.

453
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,020
Come.

454
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,460
- Bravo!
- Bravo! Bravo!

455
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,980
Distinguished guests.

456
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,980
Everyone,

457
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,220
thank you for coming today.

458
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,500
The auction starts now.

459
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,980
- Alright.
- Alright.

460
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,620
The first item.

461
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,300
A pair of emerald bracelets.

462
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,340
The starting price is one hundred taels.

463
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,420
A hundred taels. That's expensive.

464
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,100
Don't think it's too expensive.

465
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,100
Look at this luster and color.

466
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,820
- Young Master, should we take this?
- It's a rare find.

467
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,220
It depends on who can recognize it.

468
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,060
One hundred ten.

469
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,180
One hundred twenty taels.

470
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,660
- The carving is exquisite.
- One hundred fifty taels.

471
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,540
- But the material is average.
- This gentleman bids 150 taels.

472
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,620
- Suyu Pavilion won't want it.
- A rare chance. Only one pair.

473
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,940
Is there a higher bid?

474
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,060
One hundred fifty taels once.

475
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,940
One hundred fifty taels twice.

476
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,460
One hundred fifty taels.

477
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,900
Sold.

478
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,540
- Alright.
- Alright.

479
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,220
The second item is a Hetian jade pendant.

480
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,580
A Hetian jade pendant.

481
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,900
Gentlemen.

482
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
It's a Hetian jade pendant.

483
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,020
- Ms. Dandan, how is it?
- Its importance in daily wear.

484
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,740
- This Hetian jade is glossy and clear.
- Needs no further explanation.

485
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,020
- It's a treasure.
- This piece of jade.

486
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,300
In terms of both material and craftsmanship,

487
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,300
it can be said,

488
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,900
to be a top-quality piece.

489
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,220
Young Master, this one looks quite good.

490
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,860
The starting bid today is only 120 taels.

491
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,820
Bid on it.

492
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,180
Gentlemen, what are you waiting for?

493
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,140

495
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,420
This gentleman bids 140 taels.

496
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,260
150.

497
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,340
This lady bids 150 taels.

498
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340

180 taels.

502
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,140
Any higher bids?

503
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,140
180 taels, going once.

504
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,780

505
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,060
180 taels.

506
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,820
Sold.

507
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,980
Good!

508
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,900
Congratulations to this gentleman.

509
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,860
Congratulations, congratulations.

510
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,180
Congratulations.

511
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,740
Such a nuisance.

512
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,750
Next, the third treasure.

513
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,060
A gold inlaid double-heart jade lock.

514
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,060
The starting bid is 80 taels.

515
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,380
- 100 taels.
- This gentleman bids 100 taels.

516
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,580
110 taels.

517
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,980
110 taels.

518
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,780
Any higher bids?

519
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,380
130 taels.

520
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,300
- 140 taels.
- 140 taels.

521
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,220
This gentleman bids 140 taels.

522
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,980
Any higher bids?

523
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,260
150 taels.

524
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,140
Alright, 150 taels.

525
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,260
This gentleman bids 150 taels.

526
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,900
160 taels.

527
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,180
160 taels.

528
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Young Master, Young Master.

529
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,620
Look at the luster. It's so clear.

530
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,860
Young Master, did you see it?

531
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,340
Do you think I can see it?

532
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
170 taels.

533
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,420
- Young Master.
- 170 taels.

534
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,580
- Look, look.
- This gentleman bids 170 taels.

535
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,260
Any higher bids?

536
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,980
170 taels.

537
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
- Young Master, how about it?
- 170 taels, going once.

538
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,900
Such clear luster in white jade.

539
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,300
Young Master.

540
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,820
- How much is it worth?
- Any higher bids?

541
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
It's now at 180 taels.

542
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,060
- Worth thousands of taels.
- 180 taels.

543
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,060
So expensive.

544
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
But I'm curious.

545
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,740
- Why are others increasing by ten taels each?
- Any higher bids?

546
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,860
That gentleman bids 190 taels.

547
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,380
They don't have your keen eye, Young Master.

548
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,260
- That's understandable.
- Now it's at 190 taels.

549
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,340
Now the gold inlaid double-heart jade lock.

550
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,980
- 82% luster, faint blue.
- Bidding at 190 taels.

551
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,500
Any higher bids?

552
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,780
190 taels, going once.

553
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,180
190 taels,

554
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,420
- going twice.
- I shouldn't be mistaken.

555
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,140
- Bid.
- Alright.

556
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
Now it's at 190 taels.

557
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,140
200 taels.

558
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,500
250.

559
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,820
300 taels.

560
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,100
350.

561
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,180
380.

562
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,260
400 taels.

563
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,380
420.

564
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,460
450.

565
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,460
480.

566
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,140
500.

567
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,300
520, 530.

568
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,780
550.

569
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,340
600.

570
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,380
I give up.

571
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,260
Sold.

572
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,180
Congratulations.

573
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,180
Young Master, we did it.

574
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,740
Congratulations to this gentleman.

575
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,460
- Congratulations.
- Good.

576
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,860
Look, look.

577
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,460
Young Master, amazing.

578
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,140
Bought for 600 taels.

579
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,020
Next, we have

580
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,700
a jadeite pendant.

581
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,820
Look carefully.

582
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,620
600 taels. You can pay now.

583
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,620
In terms of color.

584
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
- Young Master.
- Material.

585
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
- It's top-notch.
- Something's wrong.

586
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,060
Its luster isn't the same as before.

587
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,900
What's going on?

588
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,580
Young Master, this isn't worth 600 taels.

589
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,940
- At most 200 taels.
- At most 200 taels.

590
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,100
Little liar.

591
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,420
Did you tamper with it?

592
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,300
Your family is wealthy.

593
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,740
You won't back out, right?

594
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,940
Exactly, wealthy.

595
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
Of course.

596
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,020
- You bought it.
- Pay for it.

597
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,420
- Yes, pay up.
- Pay for it.

598
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,660
If not, I'll buy it.

599
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,900
Liu.

600
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,220
This...

601
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,540
Take it.

602
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,020
It will be sent to your mansion later.

603
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,540
You have a good eye.

604
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,500
You misjudged, didn't you?

605
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,740
Stop.

606
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,180
What did you do

607
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,140
to the jade?

608
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,100
What could I have done?

609
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,900
Just used my brain.

610
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,980
If you don't explain clearly,

611
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,060
you can't leave.

612
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,100
What are you doing?

613
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,700
Young Master.

614
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,620
Young Master.

615
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,500
Young Master.

616
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,180
- Make way.
- Young Master.

617
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,380
- Make way.
- Stop.

618
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,380
- You little girl.
- Make way.

619
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,300
- Move.
- Stop.

620
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,620
Make way.

621
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,340
Move now!

622
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,700
- I...
- Young Master.

623
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,860
Young Master.

624
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,460
Young Master.

625
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,340
Young Master, you're wet.

626
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,860
Alright, I know. Get a towel.

627
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,860
Get a towel.

628
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,700
Young Master, wait for me.

629
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,940
Mr. Su.

630
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,900
Mr. Su.

631
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,940
I'm the one who just embarrassed your rival.

632
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,420
Here's the thing.

633
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,740
I want to be a jade appraiser at Suyu Pavilion.

634
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,620
I never get involved in these matters.

635
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,140
You should talk to the shopkeeper.

636
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,340
I did,

637
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,460
but he said he couldn't make the decision.

638
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,460
Mr. Su,

639
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,100
these are my sales records over the years,

640
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,740
as well as each customer's preferences.

641
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,780
I've also analyzed the competitive landscape

642
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,340
of the jade industry in the entire city.

643
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
I know many maids from official households,

644
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,740
so I understand the preferences

645
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,820
of the rich and powerful.

646
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,620
I've been preparing for years.

647
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,020
Please give me a chance.

648
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,340
Miss, let me ask you.

649
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,100
Have you ever worked at any large jade stores

650
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,340
in the Four Borders Eight Cities?

651
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,340
I...

652
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,700
Does your family have any unique skills,

653
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,860
or do you

654
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,900
have any special sales techniques?

655
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,100
I mean special ones.

656
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,180
Charming.

657
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,380
Young Master,

658
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,540
about the jade appraiser position,

659
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,700
our shop's veteran,

660
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,860
Mr. Wang's son

661
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,180
also wants to be a jade appraiser.

662
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,380
What do you think?

663
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,540
We could discuss it tomorrow.

664
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,980
Alright.

665
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,980
Mr. Su, please give me another chance.

666
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,300
Stop wasting your time.

667
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,620
(Yu, Su Jue's personal guard)
You have nothing.

668
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,100
You're not qualified to work at Suyu Pavilion,

669
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,540
let alone be a jade appraiser.

670
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,980
You should give up early.

671
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,820
(You have nothing.)

672
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,460
(You're not qualified
to work at Suyu Pavilion,)

673
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,020
(let alone be a jade appraiser.)

674
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,220
(Suxuan Clothing Shop)

675
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,060
Stop.

676
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,180
You shameless thief, swindler!

677
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,820
Let's see how I'll deal with you today.

678
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,420
Why are you staring?
Why aren't you saying anything?

679
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,180
Weren't you quite talkative before?

680
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
Keep going.

681
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,620
What? The cat got your tongue?

682
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,740
Come on. I find you

683
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,380
very strange.

684
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,660
Hey.

685
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,260
What are you doing?

686
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,580
What do you think?

687
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,620
Why is life so unfair?

688
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,700
I've worked so hard, been so diligent.

689
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,340
Why can't anyone see that?

690
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,900
I just want to be a jade appraiser.

691
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,220
Why is it so difficult?

692
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,860
Tell me.

693
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,540
Don't touch me.

694
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,420
I haven't done anything to you.

695
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Don't try to extort me.

696
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,060
A gentleman doesn't argue with a lady.

697
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,340
I'll let you go today.

698
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,820
I'll deal with you another day.

699
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
Ms. Li,

700
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,940
find this girl's home.

701
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,300
Post a hiring notice on her door.

702
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,900
Write that Qipei Pavillion

703
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,140
is hiring a jade appraiser.

704
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,340
No.

705
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,940
Hiring a maid.

706
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,620
Yes, Madam.

707
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,620
(Hiring Notice)

708
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,380
These requirements are quite exciting.

709
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,580
(Qipei Pavillion)

710
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
(Headquarters, Qipei Pavillion Jade Shop)

711
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,700
Good morning.

712
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,100
Get busy.

713
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,420
Miss, you are...

714
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,860
(Hiring Notice)

715
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,820
I'm here for the job.

716
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,780
Where should I go?

717
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,420
Alright. Keep busy.

718
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,940
(Kylin of Auspiciousness)

719
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,220
Qipei Pavillion,

720
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,580
though second in the jade industry

721
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,140
in Yuncui City,

722
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,780
its grandeur

723
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,420
is undeniable.

724
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,180
They even pave their paths with jade.

725
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,620
Did we have a thief at the Pei's Mansion?

726
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,180
Are you the lady of Qipei Pavillion?

727
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,980
Do I look like it?

728
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,420
My aura is so obvious, isn't it?

729
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,220
No, no.

730
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,020
We're just maids of the Pei's Mansion.

731
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,940
Maids? We're all maids.

732
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,220
Then we're colleagues.

733
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,380
Nice to meet you.

734
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,700
Who wants to be your colleague?

735
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,740
I'm a maid now,

736
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,300
but who knows in the future.

737
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,580
Country bumpkin.

738
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,380
Come on.

739
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,820
Your red blouse with a green skirt,

740
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,980
yellow skin with pink lips,

741
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,220
and clothes to narrow your shoulders.

742
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,140
Don't you know it makes your head look big?

743
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,980
What did you say?

744
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,860
Shh.

745
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,740
You're caked with makeup.

746
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,380
You wretch!

747
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,620
What's all the noise?

748
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,940
You're Shan Dandan, here for the job, right?

749
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,660
Madam is waiting for you.

750
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,820
Follow me.

751
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,260
(Expensive, Exquisite, Prestigious, Noble)

752
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,420
Madam.

753
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,540
Hello, Madam.

754
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,500
I've read the job requirements.

755
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,180
I don't quite understand

756
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,300
and don't want to admit it,

757
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,660
but

758
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,260
(Hiring Notice)
this is exactly who I am.

759
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,220
However.

760
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,860
However what?

761
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,340
To be honest,

762
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
I think women

763
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,020
don't necessarily have to do servant work.

764
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,300
I've always

765
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,140
wanted to be an excellent jade appraiser.

766
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,140
If you want to be a jade appraiser,

767
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,500
why did you tear down

768
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,060
my hiring notice for a maid?

769
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,820
If I hadn't taken it down,

770
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,180
how could I be standing here talking to you?

771
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,580
You're indeed honest.

772
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,940
Tell me then.

773
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,140
In your opinion,

774
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,340
what makes a jade appraiser?

775
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,820
An excellent jade appraiser

776
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,100
should

777
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,500
recognize jade,

778
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,660
understand jade,

779
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,500
craft jade,

780
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,660
(120 taels, 200 taels, 500 taels, 280 taels)

781
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,060
and sell jade.

782
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,260
They should speak eloquently
to the rich and powerful

783
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,500
and maintain relationships.

784
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,500
Madam, look.

785
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,940
These are my sales records

786
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,380
over the years.

787
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,060
It has various customer needs

788
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,940
and my analysis of the competitive landscape

789
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,340
of the jade industry in the entire city.

790
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,300
It seems I can't do

791
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,060
without you as a maid.

792
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,620
After all that,

793
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,060
I'm still a maid?

794
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,900
This maid is different.

795
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,740
Young Master, wear this jade today.

796
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,580
No.

797
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,150
This one?

798
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,880
This mutton fat jade doesn't match the silk.

799
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,930
Use this red jade instead.

800
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,010
Alright.

801
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,890
Young Master.

802
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,010
By the way,

803
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,660
are you really not going to see the new maid?

804
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,610
No.

805
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,100
Whoever hired her should see her.

806
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,060
But...

807
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,940
No buts.

808
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,700
Say one more word, and I'll hit you.

809
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,730
Young Master.

810
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,170
She's about to arrive.

811
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
(Peace and Tranquility)

812
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,270
(I can be a maid.)

813
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,870
(Endure hardships)

814
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,740
(and start anew.)

815
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,970
Young Master, hello.
I'm the new maid, Shan Dandan.

816
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,450
Anything you need help with?

817
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,220
Young Master?

818
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,250
Young Master?

819
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,530
Young Master?

820
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,090
Young Master?

821
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,970
Young Master?

822
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,340
What's all this?

823
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,610
- Why is it you?
- Why is it you?

824
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,090
Rogue!

825
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,050
Little liar.

826
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,170
What are you doing here?

827
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,970
I'm the maid chosen by Madam.

828
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,610
I don't know what you're so proud of.

829
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,570
I'm the young master of Qipei Pavilion.

830
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,050
