Also?

The young master is really fond of me.

00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,060
The young master wants you

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,540
to serve him tonight

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,140
to bathe him.

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,180
To bathe him?

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,980
I have to go to the workshop tonight.

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,340
Aren't you also a maid?

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,700
You can serve him.

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
You go.

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,740
Stop pretending to be nice.

35
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,620
Do you think I haven't tried?

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,780
The young master specifically

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,140
wants you to wash him.

38
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,940
He wants me?

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,460
Don't you think

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,340
I'm showing too much for this?

41
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,380
No way.

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Young Master,

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,740
you have such small arms and legs.

44
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,500
If you don't show a bit more,
who will you seduce?

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,540
Come on, open up more.

46
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,420
This little spy.

47
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,740
I've sacrificed a lot for you.

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
That's right.

49
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,700
Young Master, show more here.

50
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,700
Don't touch me.

51
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,420
Young Master.

52
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,140
Calm down.

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,420
- She's here. I'm leaving now.
- Go, go, go.

54
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Young...

55
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,660
Young Master.

56
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,460
Why aren't you wearing
the clothes I bought for you?

57
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,020
Didn't you give them to me?

58
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,460
Are you taking them back?

59
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,660
No. I've given them to you.

60
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,580
Good. I asked the servant to sell them.

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,300
What? Sell them?

62
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,500
I don't like dressing up.

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,900
It's a waste for me to keep them.

64
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,300
So I sold them for money

65
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
to buy some food and drinks.

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,500
You're about to bathe me.

67
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,660
How are you?

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,180
Are you looking forward to it?

69
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,460
Yes.

70
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,180
Do you want a wet rub or a dry rub?

71
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,220
Everything is ready.

72
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,940
Let me help you undress.

73
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,220
- No.
- Let me help you.

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,300
Wait, Young Master.

75
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,980
- Young Master, why are you running?
- Don't rush.

76
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,220
Aren't you going to bathe?

77
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,740
Come on, don't be shy.

78
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,980
- Let me help you undress.
- Stop.

79
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,820
I'm not bathing anymore.

80
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,100
Alright, I'm leaving.

81
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,740
Wait.

82
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,140
No bath.

83
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,140
Let's have a massage instead.

84
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,020
Alright, Young Master. Please.

85
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,260
- Come.
- I...

86
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Young Master,

87
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,540
I'll start the massage.

88
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,060
Young Master, let me smooth your hair.

89
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,140
Young Master, I have a strong grip.

90
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,780
Is this pressure okay?

91
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,660
Stop talking and hurry up.

92
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,980
Young Master, I'll stretch your muscles.

93
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,860
Stretching helps you live longer.

94
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,060
Young Master, let's do "Little Swallow Flying".

95
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
What's "Little Swallow Flying"?

96
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,580
Flying.

97
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,740
Do you feel it?

98
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,700
Feel the blue sky and white clouds.

99
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,900
Imagine flying in the sky.

100
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,940
(I'll endure this for now.)

101
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,900
(Let's see how you'll explain
when my mother arrives.)

102
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,060
Let's fly higher.

103
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,460
Do you feel the wind?

104
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,740
Madam, right up ahead.

105
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,380
Yang Yuhuan, why are you here?

106
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,300
Get down quickly.

107
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,780
We're almost there.

108
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,500
What's the matter?

109
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,700
Why did you insist on bringing me here?

110
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,220
Liu told me

111
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,660
someone is trying to seduce the young master.

112
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,620
It doesn't seem like it.

113
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,580
(You jerk, Pei Pei.)

114
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,300
(I knew you staged this)

115
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,380
(to get rid of me.)

116
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Madam, we have to go work on the jade.

117
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,380
Excuse us.

118
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
Pei,

119
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,140
what show are you putting on for me now?

120
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,500
(Delight and Peace)

121
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,900
What's wrong, Yuhuan?

122
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,180
I...

123
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,420
I...

124
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,020
I messed up the carving again.

125
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,180
It's almost finished.

126
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,340
It's already good.

127
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,700
Alright, alright.

128
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,780
Don't cry.

129
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,540
I'm too stupid.

130
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,700
How can it be your fault?

131
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,740
My ideas are too tricky.

132
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,540
But if we don't do this,

133
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,500
we can't make a breakthrough, right?

134
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,540
Alright, alright. Stop crying.

135
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,260
It's all this jade's fault.

136
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,500
This third-grade South Red Jade is too brittle.

137
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,100
I'll go to the stone shop

138
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,660
to see if they have the material we need.

139
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,980
Stop crying.

140
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,260
By the way,

141
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,580
if Mr. Pei comes to trouble me,

142
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,780
help me out, okay?

143
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,220
Okay.

144
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,100
What about me?

145
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,340
Fill your stomach first.

146
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,700
Stop crying.

147
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,780
(Zhang's Fabric Shop)

148
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,460
Miss, welcome.

149
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,100
Take a look at our shop's treasure.

150
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,660
Alright, feel free to browse.

151
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
Sir, you're here.

152
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,740
Is my order ready?

153
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,900
Yes, it is.

154
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,100
Here.

155
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,780
That piece looks good. Let's check it out.

156
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
Let's go look.

157
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,740
This one will definitely yield something good.

158
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,420
This is it.

159
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,700
Boss, this material is nice.

160
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,580
You have a good eye.

161
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,580
This piece is top quality.

162
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,500
But it's already reserved.

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,420
Boss, it doesn't matter who you sell it to.

164
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,500
Sell it to me.

165
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,420
I can't offend that person.

166
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,580
It's not possible.

167
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,020
I'm a jade appraiser from Qipei Pavilion.

168
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,340
Please make an exception.

169
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,460
The person needing this material

170
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460
is Mr. Su Jue from Suyu Pavilion.

171
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,140
You mean Qipei Pavilion
is inferior to Suyu Pavilion?

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,500
I didn't mean that.

173
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,420
- Then you...
- Dandan.

174
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,420
Shuangshuang, what are you doing here?

175
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,540
You're here to...?

176
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,060
I'm here to buy this material,
but the boss won't sell it.

177
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,780
Boss,

178
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm a gold and silver craftsman
from Suyu Pavilion.

179
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,980
I heard everything just now.

180
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
I'll explain to Mr. Su when I get back.

181
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,340
Please sell this material to my sister.

182
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,140
How can a mere craftsman

183
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,100
decide for the young master?

184
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,500
That's not possible.

185
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,380
Who says she can't decide for me?

186
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,100
Mr. Su.

187
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,260
You're here.

188
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
- Look.
- Shuangshuang,

189
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,940
what's going on?

190
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,260
Mr. Su,

191
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,100
this is my sister, Shan Dandan.

192
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,660
She wants that material.

193
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,340
But you reserved it.

194
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,500
I remember her.

195
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
I heard she's working at Qipei Pavilion now.

196
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,620
Yes, it's her.

197
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,340
Shuangshuang, I'll be leaving.

198
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,380
Goodbye.

199
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,100
What's the rush? You want the jade, right?

200
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
You already know I'm from Qipei Pavilion.

201
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,540
Of course, you won't give me the jade.

202
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,220
I'm not that petty.

203
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,900
Since you are Shuangshuang's sister,

204
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,460
you are also a sister of Suyu Pavilion.

205
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,340
You can have the jade.

206
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,410
- Thank you, Mr. Su.
- Really?

207
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,780
A gentleman helps others succeed.

208
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,180
I don't need it anyway.

209
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,980
If it can help you

210
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,540
in the Jade Competition,

211
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,020
it'll be well used.

212
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,220
How did you know?

213
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,220
Just a guess.

214
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,780
Wrap it up.

215
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,860
Also,

216
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,700
Shuangshuang can make any decision
for Suyu Pavilion.

217
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,820
Watch your mouth.

218
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,100
Mind your attitude.

219
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,660
Yes, Mr. Su.

220
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,060
Thank you, Mr. Su.

221
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,060
You're welcome.

222
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,780
(Jade Shop)

223
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,620
Mr. Su,

224
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
you are so talented and generous.

225
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,260
Pei Pei is not even a fraction of you.

226
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,240
No, not even one ten-thousandth.

227
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,100
No, no.

228
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,980
Not even your little toe.

229
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,380
Ms. Dandan, you flatter me.

230
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,620
Thank you.

231
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,060
You little spy.

232
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,380
You're praising your true master.

233
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
What are you doing?

234
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,420
You bought this with my family's money.

235
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,580
I can smash it if I want to.

236
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,060
I searched the whole city

237
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,620
(Jade Shop)
to find this piece of material.

238
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,020
You smashed it.

239
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,080
What about the Jade Competition?

240
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,140
You little spy.

241
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,300
I caught you. Stop acting.

242
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,220
Pretending to be a good person.

243
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,420
Dandan,

244
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,260
Mr. Pei is so rude.

245
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,940
You should leave there.

246
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,300
No way.

247
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,220
The madam trusts me.

248
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,660
I can't let her down.

249
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,260
Shuangshuang, don't worry.

250
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm fine. I can handle it.

251
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,020
Then I'll go now.

252
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,380
Young Master,

253
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,420
I'm worried about my sister.

254
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
I want to check on her.

255
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,740
Miss, look at this bronze mirror.

256
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,940
Finely crafted.

257
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,780
See? It works well, doesn't it?

258
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,620
If you like any,

259
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,580
we can give you a discount.

260
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,700
Our bronze mirrors

261
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,260
are the latest models.

262
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,940
See? It makes you look like a fairy.

263
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,220
Any you like?

264
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,860
If you like any,

265
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,260
we'll give you a discount.

266
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,220
These models

267
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
are the best sellers.

268
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,740
These are too expensive.

269
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,540
This price is already cheap.

270
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,340
What are you doing?

271
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,860
- Are you taking advantage of me?
- No, I'm not.

272
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,060
- Are you taking advantage of me?
- I just...

273
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,340
- Are you taking advantage of me?
- No.

274
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,700
You're harassing me.

275
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,540
I'm not.

276
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,220
Someone just pushed me.

277
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,820
I don't care. You're harassing me.

278
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,900
Everyone, look!

279
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,180
He's harassing me.

280
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,340
You're still denying it.

281
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,500
Why were you winking at me?

282
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,580
Clearly lusting after my beauty.

283
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,820
Bullying a virtuous girl like me.

284
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,500
How dare you laugh after harassing me?

285
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,740
I'll report you to the authorities.

286
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,060
- Let's go.
- No.

287
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,380
- No, no.
- Everyone, look!

288
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,500
Let's go.

289
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,940
I...

290
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,100
Didn't expect you to apologize so quickly.

291
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,740
Alright then.

292
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,260
I'll forgive you this time.

293
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
Don't do it again.

294
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,380
Sir,

295
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,060
I'll wait for you to marry me.

296
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,700
Uncle.

297
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,100
Jue'er.

298
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,780
Uncle.

299
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,860
(Wang Jiu, Suyu Pavilion's shopkeeper)
Find the best materials

300
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,700
for hollow and fine carving.

301
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,620
Buy them all.

302
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,420
I just ran into Pei Pei.

303
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,860
He's looking for these materials.

304
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,340
Why are you involved with the Pei family?

305
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,020
If I don't,

306
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,620
how will I know what materials

307
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,100
they're using for the Jade Competition?

308
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,500
Got it.

309
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,660
No materials, no competition.

310
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,580
This is a good plan.

311
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,500
Let me, let me.

312
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,380
Thank you.

313
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,860
You're here. Come and sit.

314
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,940
We found the jade,

315
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,500
but time is tight.

316
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,620
We'll work through the night.

317
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,620
Thank you.

318
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,460
Dandan.

319
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Someone proposed to me today.

320
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,780
Proposed?

321
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Who? Do I know him?

322
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,060
It's Mr. Li, the gardener.

323
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
I've secretly liked him for a long time.

324
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,500
Congratulations!

325
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,260
If we win first place

326
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,100
in the Jade Competition,

327
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,220
it'll be double the joy.

328
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,540
Dandan, this marriage was arranged by Mr. Pei.

329
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,500
It was hard for him to agree.

330
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,580
He gave me a month off

331
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,060
to get married

332
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
and even helped with the dowry.

333
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,660
A month?

334
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,220
But the Jade Competition will be over by then.

335
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,860
I...

336
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,300
I'm in a tough spot too.

337
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,660
But you know,

338
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,860
it's not easy for someone like me

339
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,860
to find a person I truly like to marry.

340
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,660
But...

341
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,620
Dandan,

342
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,100
we don't always have to be so strong.

343
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,020
We've worked hard and tried our best.

344
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,180
What competition

345
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
is more important than personal happiness?

346
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,700
It's okay.

347
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,100
Your happiness is what matters most.

348
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,660
Thank you.

349
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,780
Then,

350
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,380
I'll go prepare.

351
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,060
Alright.

352
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,380
Go ahead.

353
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,700
(Pei Pei,)

354
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,940
(you won't get away with this.)

355
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,100
This is really ruthless.

356
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,700
Liu,

357
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,700
is there a chance

358
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,300
that this egg should be peeled?

359
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,180
Stop.

360
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Is this egg raw or cooked?

361
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,260
It's raw.

362
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,580
Could it be

363
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,620
that we need a cooked egg?

364
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,500
Young Master, wait here.

365
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,780
I'll get you a cooked one.

366
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,900
Why are you doing this?

367
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,020
Breaking

368
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,660
into my room at night.

369
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,960
Get out.

370
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,260
Why are you doing this?

371
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,460
What did I do?

372
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,020
You keep targeting me, causing me trouble.

373
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,260
You're the young master, so I can overlook it.

374
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,980
But you've gone too far.

375
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,740
To stop me from entering the Jade Competition,

376
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,060
you took away my only helper.

377
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,020
You little spy.

378
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,180
If I let you represent our family

379
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,020
in the competition,

380
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,780
we'd be doomed.

381
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,740
I said I'm not a spy.

382
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,500
What do I have to do for you to believe me?

383
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,300
I only believe my own eyes.

384
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,020
Just because you're the young master,

385
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,620
do you think you can slander people?

386
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,620
Being the young master makes you special, huh?

387
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,460
You think you can destroy someone's hard work?

388
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,580
I just want to be a jade appraiser

389
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,900
and enter the Jade Competition. Is that wrong?

390
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,780
At least I'm better than you,

391
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,100
a useless man who does nothing.

392
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,180
Shut up.

393
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,980
Useless?

394
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,620
What right do you have to call me that?

395
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,340
You keep talking about your dreams

396
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,500
of being a jade appraiser,

397
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,740
but you can't even draw a design,

398
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,460
let alone carve.

399
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,500
I think you just want

400
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,020
to cheat for more money.

401
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,540
If I can't draw, I can learn.

402
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,660
If I can't carve, I can learn.

403
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,700
Not everyone starts

404
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
on the same path

405
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,940
or has the right to pursue their dreams.

406
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,420
But even so,

407
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,660
I've never given up,

408
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,820
and I work hard every day.

409
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,540
What about you?

410
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,420
As the young master of the Pei family,

411
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,580
you live in luxury,

412
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,540
eating and drinking in the mansion,

413
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,460
while watching your mother struggle.

414
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,260
You can do everything,

415
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,300
but you choose to do nothing.

416
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,140
Mr. Pei,

417
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
what are you

418
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,980
if not useless?

419
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,860
Enough.

420
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,020
Get lost.

421
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,940
Even without help,

422
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,220
no matter how much trouble you cause,

423
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,860
I won't give up.

424
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm going

425
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,540
to the Jade Competition.

426
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,300
(Peace and Tranquility)

427
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,900
Useless.

428
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,100
Everyone thinks

429
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
I'm willing

430
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,380
to be useless.

431
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,140
Did you know?

432
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,350
The young master was angry yesterday.

433
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,220
- Really?
- Yes.

434
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,740
He was furious.

435
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,780
(Peace and Tranquility)

436
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,180
Why are you so late today?

437
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,420
The young master has a temper.

438
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,460
He fought yesterday.

439
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,700
He can't wake up early.

440
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,380
Are you crazy? Talking like that?

441
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,500
Everyone in the household knows.

442
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,300
I heard Shan Dandan caught a cold

443
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,100
in the rain and is bedridden.

444
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,700
Serves her right.

445
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,900
That serious?

446
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,820
Give me that.

447
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,820
Go.

448
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,700
Young Master, you're awake.

449
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,740
Come. Eat while it's hot.

450
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,420
Young Master.

451
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,380
Who were you talking to outside?

452
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Cuiliu.

453
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,580
Seems you're used

454
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,180
to Ms. Dandan's cooking.

455
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,580
Oh, my big mouth.

456
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,100
I heard people outside

457
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,060
talking about Shan Dandan.

458
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,460
It's Cuiliu's fault.

459
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,740
I'll scold her later.

460
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,420
No one should mention her in front of you.

461
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,860
Good.

462
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
Young Master,

463
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,060
Cuiliu said Shan Dandan is so sick

464
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,700
she can't get out of bed.

465
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,220
Should we call a doctor for her?

466
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,820
This season, catching a cold

467
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,300
is no small matter.

468
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,380
Such an ingrate.

469
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,300
Who knows what spell he's under,

470
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,380
calling me a spy?

471
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,420
I think he's the delusional troublemaker.

472
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,140
And Su Jue.

473
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,980
When I begged you

474
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,460
for a job,

475
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,420
you ignored me.

476
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,380
Now I've finally found a job,

477
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,580
you suddenly help me.

478
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,660
I can't clear my name now.

479
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,060
Both of them are jerks.

480
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,740
Didn't you say

481
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,860
she was very sick?

482
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,180
That's what Cuiliu said.

483
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,620
Who knew she'd be so lively?

484
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,580
Yuhuan is gone.

485
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,420
Relying on myself to learn carving.

486
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,940
How long will it take?

487
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,580
So stupid.

488
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Who's outside?

489
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,700
No one.

490
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,860
You really are clever.

491
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,460
Well...

492
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,700
What are you doing here?

493
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,980
This is my home.

494
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,460
I can go wherever I want.

495
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,340
This room was given to me by the madam.

496
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
Leave.

497
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,020
You're sick. Stop that.

498
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,540
None of your business.

499
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
I said you were stupid, and you really are.

500
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,540
- Liu.
- Yes, Young Master.

501
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,020
Enough.

502
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,980
When I was little,

503
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,500
my hands were full of scars.

504
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,620
With your technique,

505
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,620
you can't even carve silk patterns.

506
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,940
It looks like all of our stone materials

507
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,420
might be wasted by you.

508
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,340
If you'd broken fewer stones,

509
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,500
we'd have plenty.

510
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,940
(Hanging Earring)

511
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
That's a hanging earring?

512
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,820
Good idea.

513
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,060
Too bad

514
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,940
your technique is poor.

515
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,180
Thanks to you,

516
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,900
the raw stone is shattered into pieces,

517
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,700
only enough to make a pair of hanging earrings.

518
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,500
Alright.

519
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,700
Switch to the Knife No. 3.

520
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,460
Hurry up.

521
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,620
Hold the jade with your left hand.

522
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,880
Hold the knife with your right hand.

523
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,060
Press down.

524
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,940
The handle is too tilted.

525
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,900
Too much force. Reduce by ten percent.

526
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,980
Now slowly push down.

527
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,420
Go.

528
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,100
Withdraw.

529
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,980
It worked.

530
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,620
It...

531
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,540
You're sick. Don't drink cold water.

532
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,500
Who is useless now?

533
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,380
Ms. Dandan, you should rest.

534
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,020
Here's some good medicine for your cold.

535
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,780
Remember to take it.

536
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,860
Madam, this is my sample work.

537
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,820
I know my skills are not great,

538
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,660
but if I had a better craftsman to work with,

539
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,980
I could improve significantly.

540
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,060
This is a hanging earring?

541
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,380
Though crudely carved,

542
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,340
it has a clever design.

543
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,500
I've never seen this type
of hanging earrings before.

544
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,020
The droplet-shaped design above the earrings

545
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,420
lightens the customer's burden.

546
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,580
It's creative and practical.

547
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,260
Very nice.

548
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,620
Very nice indeed.

549
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,620
Thank you for your praise, Madam.

550
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,140
Ms. Dandan's design is indeed clever,

551
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,540
but from the patterns, style,
and knife technique,

552
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,100
I can tell this wasn't done

553
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,180
by Ms. Dandan alone.

554
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,580
This design appears simple

555
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,820
but requires someone skilled in carving

556
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,820
to understand.

557
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,260
Dandan,

558
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,980
did someone help you?

559
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,140
(It turns out this rogue is quite skilled.)

560
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,900
Someone did give me some pointers,

561
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,260
but

562
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,620
I guarantee on my honor,

563
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,460
this hanging earring is my idea alone.

564
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,980
No one else helped me.

565
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,660
Using your honor as a guarantee?

566
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,260
I believe you.

567
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,540
But Madam…

568
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,500
Shopkeeper Hao,

569
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,180
our pavilion

570
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,220
needs to change.

571
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,620
I like Dandan's enthusiasm

572
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,140
and cleverness very much.

573
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,460
Thank you, Madam.

574
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,580
Come.

575
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,660
Dandan,

576
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,860
this piece of jade

577
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,620
is of medium quality

578
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,060
and too small in size.

579
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,700
If you want it to stand out

580
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,460
or be presentable

581
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
at the Jade Competition,

582
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,620
you need a complete piece

583
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,620
of high-quality Hetian Cyan jade.

584
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,660
Actually, I found a whole piece before,

585
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,020
but unfortunately,

586
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,300
I ruined it while carving.

587
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,660
Alright, it's okay.

588
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,100
Take care of your health first.

589
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,700
Mr. Hao will handle

590
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,580
the stone material.

591
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,300
Thank you, Madam.

592
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,140
(A few days later)

593
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,220
(Qipei Pavilion)

594
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,060
Mr. Hao.

595
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,780
Ms. Dandan, are you feeling better?

596
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
Fully recovered.

597
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,420
Mr. Hao,

598
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,300
is the Hetian jade you mentioned
in the storeroom?

599
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,380
Take me to see it.

600
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,900
In the past few days,

601
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,860
our shop assistants

602
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,420
have searched every shop in town.

603
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,700
Not a single piece of Hetian jade can be found.

604
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,740
How is that possible?

605
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
How can there be no Hetian jade at all?

606
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
Mr. Hao,

607
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,220
now,

608
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,060
money doesn't matter anymore.

609
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,860
The Jade Competition is so important.

610
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,580
As long as the jade is good,

611
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,940
it's worth it even if it's expensive.

612
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,580
You think I'm worried about money?

613
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,580
There's none for sale.

614
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,980
You can't buy it even if you have the money.

615
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,100
Go check for yourself if you don't believe me.

616
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,700
Mr. Hao,

617
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,100
that's not what I meant.

618
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,140
Young Master,

619
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
we've searched for so many days

620
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,500
and still can't find any Hetian jade.

621
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,740
It's too strange.

622
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,860
Stop complaining.

623
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,380
Check the Jade Pavilion up ahead.

624
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,100
(Jade Shop)

625
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,940
Young Master,

626
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,340
I've found out.

627
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,940
There's no stone material for sale

628
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,860
anywhere in the market,

629
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,820
except for the black market.

630
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,220
The black market?

631
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,900
Where is it?

632
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,620
At the East Street market for groceries.

633
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,660
Let's go then.

634
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
Not a good idea, Young Master.

635
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,700
The black market is chaotic and dangerous.

636
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,500
If one wants to buy
and the other wants to sell,

637
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,940
as long as we have the money,
there's no danger. Let's go.

638
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,580
(Liquor)

639
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,420
No.

640
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,300
Young Master.

641
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,380
I must find some helpers.

642
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,540
If anything happens to you,

643
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,560
I can't bear the responsibility.

644
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,740
Fine, do as you wish. Let's go.

645
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:51,740
(Jade Shop)

646
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,820
Thank you, Miss.

647
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,780
(Feels like raw stone.)

648
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,060
Sir, where are you delivering this?

649
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,020
This? I'm delivering it to a seafood boss

650
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,540
at the East Street market.

651
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,180
Thank you, Miss.

652
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,340
Take care.

653
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,300
(Sauce Area, Black Market)

654
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,140
Bet big or small.

655
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,060
- I bet big.
- I bet small.

656
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,620
Alright, no more bets.

657
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,980
Hurry. Let's bet.

658
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,540
(Fresh Goods)

659
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Careful, sir.

660
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,820
What? Are you buying groceries?

661
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,500
No, just looking around.

662
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,020
If you're not buying, what's there to look at?

663
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,060
Go home.

664
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,740
Sometimes you buy without buying,

665
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,660
and not buying is buying.

666
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,980
Got it. We're in the same boat.

667
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,180
Thanks for your help earlier, Miss.

668
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
No problem.

669
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
- Okay.
- Sir, please.

670
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,540
(Fresh goods)

671
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,660
(I haven't been here for days.)

672
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,780
(These black market stalls
are getting even more secretive.)

673
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,940
(In the black market,
they've always mixed fish and jade.)

674
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,180
(They sell seafood openly.)

675
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,260
(In reality, they deal in smuggled goods.)

676
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,460
(The stall selling stone materials...)

677
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,420
Sir, do you have any materials?

678
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,580
Miss,

679
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,020
I'm an old man selling fish.

680
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,980
If you want materials for sauce,

681
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,420
it's over there.

682
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,700
We're in the same boat.

683
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,300
Miss, please forgive me.

684
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,900
Government officials

685
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,620
are getting stricter with this.

686
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,250
- Big.
- Small.

687
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,460
All my good stuff is here.

688
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,820
Is it the same over here?

689
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,700
Yes.

690
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,820
This piece is good.

691
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,740
You've got a good eye, Miss.

692
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,980
Hetian Cyan, top quality.

693
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,220
How much for this?

694
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,420
800 taels.

695
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,060
You've brought it to the black market

696
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,360
and you're still holding out on the price?

697
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,500
600 taels.

698
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,780
600 taels won't sell.

699
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,700
Alright, alright. As you say.

700
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,140
800 taels.

701
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,140
- Big, big, big.
- Small, small.

702
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,460
- Big, big.
- Small.

703
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,420
Open it!

704
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,980
Do you know how to do it?

705
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,620
- What's going on?
- Seriously.

706
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,260
- Sir.
- Next round, I'll bet big again.

707
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
Do you have any materials?

708
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,500
Come again.

709
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,500
I don't believe it. I'm sure to win.

710
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,540
Alright, come.

711
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,660
In the same boat?

712
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,420
That's right.

713
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,860
The boat.

714
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,100
Is he a government official?

715
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,980
Go and see. If it comes to worse,
grab our weapons.

716
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,860
I'm here this time

717
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,380
to buy some Hetian jade.

718
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,540
What materials do you have here?

719
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,420
Bring them out for me to see.

720
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,980
(Pei Pei?)

721
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,500
(What's he doing in the black market?)

722
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,220
(To smash my jade again?)

723
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,340
Sir,

724
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,580
you might be mistaken.

725
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,860
We only have shrimp and crabs here,

726
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,060
nothing like Hetian jade.

727
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,500
Never heard of it.

728
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,900
No, look. Why are you hiding things from me?

729
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,860
If you don't bring them out,
I'll find them myself.

730
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,340
What are you doing?

731
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,460
Sir,

732
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,940
are you deliberately looking for trouble?

733
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,060
