(Peace and Tranquility)

24
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,040
I have a request.

25
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,410
I've been in the house

26
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,360
serving the madam for over ten years.

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,170
The madam rises at 5 am

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,850
and sleeps at 9 pm.

29
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,450
Though she's old,

30
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,080
she loves sweets.

31
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,410
The madam's habits and likes

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,040
are imprinted in my bones.

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,760
Now that the madam has passed,

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,290
I...

35
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,250
Aside from sorrow,

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,690
I find no purpose in staying here.

37
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,570
Today,

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
I request your permission

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,570
to return home

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,640
to be a vegetarian and pray

41
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,290
for the madam's peaceful next life,

42
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,170
free from suffering.

43
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,530
Ms. Li,

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,700
since you've decided,

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,340
we won't keep you.

46
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Thank you, Young Master.

47
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,420
Thank you, Ms. Dandan.

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,260
Ms. Li,

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,860
I'll help you pack your things.

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,500
Thank you, Ms. Shuangshuang.

51
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,500
The madam passed suddenly.

52
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,860
You must be very sad.

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,340
Yes.

54
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,540
With the madam gone,

55
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,860
I feel lost

56
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,140
as if nothing I do has any meaning.

57
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,180
Do we know what illness took the madam?

58
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,540
It was tuberculosis,

59
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,300
an old ailment.

60
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,900
It's the aconite herb.

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,340
If carefully prepared,

62
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,540
it can kill people

63
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,300
within half a day.

64
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,540
Thank you for taking care of the madam.

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,660
I hope you live peacefully

66
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,460
after leaving here.

67
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,980
Thank you, Ms. Shuangshuang.

68
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,780
Oh, no. Ms. Li has fainted!

69
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,620
Dandan.

70
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,300
What's happening?

71
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,460
She was fine just now.

72
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,100
I was just helping her pack.

73
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,420
She was ready to leave

74
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,980
but suddenly collapsed.

75
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,780
Liu, go get a doctor!

76
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,900
Alright.

77
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,420
Check her belongings

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,900
for any emergency medicine.

79
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,380
This...

80
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,540
This is the aconite herb.

81
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,740
It contains aconitine,

82
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,300
which can numb the nerves.

83
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,850
It can cause rapid heartbeat,

84
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,630
a drop in body temperature, and even death.

85
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Why would Ms. Li carry such a thing?

86
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,740
Do you remember

87
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,100
the bowl of soup by the madam's bed?

88
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,300
Ms. Li made that soup herself.

89
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,660
Are you saying

90
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,780
Ms. Li killed the madam?

91
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,820
Impossible.

92
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,220
Ms. Li served the madam for years,

93
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,060
always loyal.

94
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
The doctor said

95
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,980
it was an old ailment.

96
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,980
Spare me!

97
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,100
Spare me, please!

98
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,260
It was her!

99
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,100
She poisoned the madam!

100
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,620
This wicked woman!

101
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,900
She forced me to do it.

102
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,340
If I didn't obey,

103
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,780
she'd have me killed.

104
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,540
I had no choice!

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,220
But as a doctor,

106
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,860
I failed to save lives

107
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,220
and instead caused death.

108
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,620
I can't live without the guilt.

109
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,900
The madam had no severe illness.

110
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,300
She died

111
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,860
because of the colorless, tasteless

112
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,620
aconite herb in her soup.

113
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,500
You...

114
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,820
Why?

115
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,460
How could you?

116
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,380
Why?

117
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,340
She treated you so well.

118
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,740
Why did you harm her?

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,780
Treated me well?

120
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,340
I served her carefully

121
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,900
day and night for decades.

122
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,740
And what was I to her?

123
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,660
Just a dog.

124
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,540
Why would I want to kill her?

125
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,580
I've wanted her dead for years.

126
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,740
Shut up.

127
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,900
Liu,

128
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,740
report this to the authorities.

129
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,900
Alright.

130
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,260
Go.

131
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,500
I was with the madam that day.

132
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,300
Ms. Li made the lotus root soup

133
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,420
for the young master

134
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,780
and Ms. Dandan.

135
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,580
The madam said Ophiopogon is cold by nature,

136
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,900
not suitable for you,

137
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,180
so she took it herself.

138
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
So that day,

139
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,060
you meant to harm me and the young master.

140
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,900
We have no grudge.

141
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,820
Why would you harm me?

142
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,140
Who put you up to this?

143
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,660
Speak!

144
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,140
That's right.

145
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
I wanted you dead.

146
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,580
I wanted all of you dead.

147
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,420
Do I need someone to put me up to this?

148
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,940
I was jealous and angry.

149
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,020
I hated seeing you all happy,

150
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,900
ignoring the servants.

151
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,420
I wanted

152
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,660
you privileged people

153
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,140
to taste pain too.

154
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,660
(Wang Jiu,)

155
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,300
(I can't wait for you any longer.)

156
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,540
(In the next life,)

157
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,420
(you must marry me.)

158
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,940
(Fine Gold and Good Jade)

159
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,820
What's wrong?

160
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,020
Ms. Li is dead.

161
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm sure.

162
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,740
Shopkeeper.

163
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,770
I'll check again.

164
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,660
Get out.

165
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,820
As long as you stand up again,

166
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,700
Qipei Pavilion will prosper sooner or later.

167
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,300
I have confidence in you.

168
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,900
Pei.

169
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,020
Mother.

170
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,100
Pei.

171
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,540
You're back.

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,860
Pei.

173
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,780
You can't go anywhere until you eat properly.

174
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,620
Pei!

175
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,900
Pei!

176
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,780
You brat.

177
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
Finish your meal before you go.

178
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,060
Pei, do you want to carve jade?

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,540
Shh.

180
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,660
Quiet.

181
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,980
What?

182
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,940
I'm fishing.

183
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,020
I asked if you wanted to carve jade.

184
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,660
I'm fishing!

185
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,660
Carve jade.

186
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm fishing!

187
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,560
You brat. Fine.

188
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,220
Just wait.

189
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,540
- What are you doing?
- Are you still fishing?

190
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,680
- What are you doing?
- You...

191
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,600
Are you pointing at me? What are you doing?

192
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,900
Put it down.

193
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,700
- I won't.
- Put it down.

194
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,580
I won't.

195
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,180
You brat, come here!

196
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,020
No.

197
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,140
Why are you going to Flower Pavilion?

198
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,300
To squander your fortune, of course.

199
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,140
What else?

200
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,160
You unfilial son.

201
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,600
You're driving me mad.

202
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,180
Look at you, all grown up,

203
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,760
still so irresponsible.

204
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,160
Stop right there!

205
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,520
Stop!

206
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,120
I...

207
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,240
I don't have a mother anymore.

208
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,000
Why?

209
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,640
I don't have a mother anymore.

210
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,160
I don't have a mother anymore.

211
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,680
Pei Pei,

212
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,280
The madam was the best mother in the world.

213
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,360
You've made her proud.

214
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,620
Here.

215
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,520
For you,

216
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,120
I can be your spy in the Pei family.

217
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,920
To help you achieve your great plans,

218
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm willing to do anything.

219
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,920
Guixiang.

220
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry to put you through this.

221
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,600
You never minded my background as a maid,

222
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,780
and you were the first

223
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,640
to make me a promise in this world.

224
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,600
What does a little hardship matter?

225
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,860
Guixiang,

226
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,280
I never imagined

227
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,640
you'd sacrifice your life

228
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,040
to protect me.

229
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,240
But don't worry.

231
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,120
I will avenge you.

232
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,640
The Pei family.

233
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,280
I won't let them go.

234
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,480
Who are you burning paper for?

235
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,500
It's so late.

236
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,940
Why are you still awake?

237
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,040
I'm asking you who you're doing this for.

238
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,360
It can't be Madam Pei, can it?

239
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,360
Could it be...?

240
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,840
Yes, it's her.

241
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,740
Where do you think I've been getting

242
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,860
the latest news and designs from Qipei Pavilion

243
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,080
all these years?

244
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,560
My plan was

245
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,620
to kill Pei Pei and Shan Dandan,

246
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,960
the two stumbling blocks.

247
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,940
But that old fox

248
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,040
died first.

249
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,700
It's just

250
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,920
a pity for my Guixiang.

251
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,540
Are you mad?

252
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,040
How could you kill someone?

253
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,800
What else could I do?

254
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,540
Watch our hundred-year legacy be destroyed?

255
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,400
So what?

256
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Don't we have strength?

257
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,360
Can't we start over?

258
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,780
But your hands are stained with blood,

259
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,880
involved in murder. Can you wash it clean?

260
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,300
Who do you think you killed?

261
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,580
Madam Pei!

262
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,820
The madam of Qipei Pavilion.

263
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,800
How can you speak so lightly?

264
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,100
Fool.

265
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,120
Starting over?

266
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,980
You make it sound so easy.

267
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,320
With what will we start over?

268
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,480
Is there still time?

269
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,720
Is there still a chance?

270
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,960
Jue,

271
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,880
fate has placed a great responsibility on us.

272
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,060
It has come to this.

273
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,880
We have no way back now.

274
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,800
I don't want this either.

275
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,160
But now,

276
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,440
Guixiang's life is lost.

277
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,240
No matter what,

278
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,080
I'll fight them to the death.

279
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,960
Come with me.

280
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,320
Why is there a secret room?

281
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,600
Come in.

282
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,480
How could there be a dungeon?

283
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,600
I never knew all these years.

284
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,660
Who...

285
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,440
Who is this?

286
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,180
(Pei Chufeng, Qipei Pavilion)

287
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,640
Don't hit me.

288
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,400
I'll paint.

289
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,740
This...

290
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,800
This is Pei Pei's biological father,

291
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,440
Pei Chufeng.

292
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,560
Pei Chufeng?

293
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
This...

294
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,240
What on earth is going on?

295
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,920
At this point,

296
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,640
I won't hide it from you anymore.

297
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,400
When you were young,

298
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,600
Qipei Pavilion's quality and craftsmanship

299
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,600
always overshadowed us,

300
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,880
making your father unable to lift his head,

301
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,790
until the Emperor

302
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,580
(Guard Zhao, Qipei Pavilion)
wanted the Moonlight Crown.

303
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,020
The City Lord appointed

304
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,240
this old guy as the chief designer.

305
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,680
Your father had no choice
but to steal the treasure.

306
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,980
There's an assassin!

307
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,120
Who are you?

308
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,440
Hand over the Crown.

309
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,540
(Shan Jingtian, a warrior)

310
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,580
Wang Jiu!

311
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,560
Shan Jingtian.

312
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,400
Give me the Crown.

313
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,300
We agreed that day.

314
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,640
I would get the Crown for you.

315
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,040
You get the Crown,

316
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,940
and I get the water amber on it

317
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,960
for my wife's illness.

318
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,080
What are you doing now?

319
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,860
Using water amber as medicine

320
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,040
to treat all diseases.

321
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,980
You really believe that?

322
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,560
Such an ignorant fool.

323
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,540
You...

324
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,980
I valued you and hired you to steal the Crown.

325
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,460
Now that I have the Crown,

326
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,500
you should go to the afterlife.

327
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,840
Didn't you see this coming?

328
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,860
Yes. Water amber is precious,

329
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,780
but there are countless treasures in the world.

330
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,540
The real value is in the amazing craftsmanship

331
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,980
of the Crown.

332
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,600
You wouldn't understand.

333
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,720
Think about it as a ghost in the afterlife.

334
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,340
Sir,

335
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,160
I was deceived

336
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,360
into stealing your precious treasure.

337
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,360
Today, I'll sacrifice my life

338
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,360
to return it to its rightful owner.

339
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,080
At that time, Qipei Pavilion
couldn't produce the Crown.

340
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,560
So, we seized

341
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,080
the opportunity

342
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,240
and presented our prepared backup crown.

343
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,920
From then on, our reputation soared nationwide.

344
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,840
So, Suyu Pavilion became what it is today.

345
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,240
For so many years,

346
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,200
I only knew there was a drawing
of the Crown in our house.

347
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,980
Come here.

348
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,560
(I'll kill you together.)

349
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,360
Careful! It's poison!

350
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,880
You go first.

351
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,880
I entrust my daughter to you.

352
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,040
I need to get the remaining Crown.

353
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,840
Take good care of her for me.

354
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,720
Actually, we've always had the Crown.

355
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,960
But one half

356
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,160
was taken by that thief.

357
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,300
Now, even with our skills,

358
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,880
we can't master its craftsmanship.

359
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,140
Remember when your father

360
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,840
taught you some techniques,

361
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,800
but you couldn't master them?

362
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,200
Those were the techniques from the Crown.

363
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,720
So,

364
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,920
because I couldn't master them,

365
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,480
you broke

366
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,640
Pei Pei's hand?

367
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,960
Yes.

368
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,380
After dealing with the old,

369
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,620
the young one emerged to fight with you.

370
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,400
How could your father let them succeed?

371
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,800
(It's your fault for outshining Jue.)

372
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,640
(Your talent is your fault.)

373
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,600
So, all these years,

374
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,160
I never truly won against him.

375
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,840
I was just a clown,

376
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,440
feeling proud for years.

377
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,440
The one who laughs last is the true winner.

378
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,120
Jue,

379
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,880
don't blame me and your father
for being ruthless.

380
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,580
The world's contests are fatal.

381
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,240
Only the victor can rule.

382
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,720
Look at Pei Pei.

383
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,880
As soon as he gained the raw stone,

384
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,880
he was eager to destroy us.

385
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,360
When the Crown was lost,

386
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,980
your father spread rumors,

387
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,210
making people suspect he stole it himself.

388
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,640
The City Lord investigated him three times,

389
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,020
making him live in constant fear,

390
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,160
afraid to let his son shine.

391
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,540
But Pei Pei

392
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,880
glanced at the Crown's dissection diagram

393
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,980
and could mimic its techniques

394
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,480
to seventy percent.

395
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,840
For you, for the Su family,

396
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,600
your father and I had no choice.

397
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,960
So, a few years after the Crown was lost,

398
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,400
there were rumors that Pei Chufeng

399
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,820
died in a fire

400
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,880
while on a business trip.

401
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,640
That was you too?

402
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
Yes.

403
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,920
Your father and I brought him here.

404
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,400
It was you.

405
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,200
You're lucky

406
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,200
to survive this.

407
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,400
Since you're still alive,

408
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,600
you'll be used by us.

409
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,040
One, to stop him from investigating the theft.

410
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,960
Two, to prevent him from teaching his son.

411
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,920
Three, to use his skills

412
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,800
to pave the way for the Su family.

413
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,840
Right now,

414
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,160
he still has a crucial use.

415
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,640
What do you plan to do?

416
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,440
Use his hands

417
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,240
to completely destroy Qipei Pavilion.

But...

430
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,160
Do you have any other thoughts?

431
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,700
Our main shop is well-known.

432

Besides other shops' promotions,

we can bring old customers to new shops.

For anyone buying jewelry at our main shop,

we'll ask them to pick up goods at other shops.

I'll tell the young master.

No.

461
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,300
I want to talk to Mr. Pei alone.

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,460
Sure.

What do you want to discuss?

466
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,300
You made this?

467
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,620
Yes.

A small gift for Dandan.

For the lost techniques of the Moonlight Crown,

470
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,900
whether it's gold and silver inlay,
filigree carving,

471
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,300
or hollow vertical carving,

472
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
you've mastered them all.

473
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,820
Who taught you?

474
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,060
My father participated
in the design of the Crown.

475
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,780
He was familiar with many techniques.

476
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,060
When I was young,

477
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,900
I was lucky to see the actual Crown.

478
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,740
Plus, my father taught me,

479
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,780
so I know a bit.

480
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,020
Other techniques

481
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,980
occasionally appear in the world.

482
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,540
What about the melting technique
of South Bead and gold?

483
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,780
Except for the Sun family's technique
on the Crown,

484
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,060
nowhere else has it.

485
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,780
You only saw it a few times as a child,

486
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,860
yet mastered it.

487
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,900
You must have studied the actual Crown

488
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,420
for over ten years

489
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,940
to achieve this.

490
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,140
What?

491
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,780
How could I have the actual Crown?

492
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,460
I was just influenced by my father.

493
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,940
Influenced?

494
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,820
You said you learned from your father.

495
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,820
Who did he learn from?

496
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,540
The Crown was crafted

497
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,580
by dozens of master artisans.

498
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
Your father was the chief designer,

499
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,740
but not uniquely skilled.

500
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,140
As a kid,

501
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,300
you mastered so many core techniques.

502
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,020
Do you find that reasonable?

503
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,300
What do you mean?

504
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,860
Are you accusing my father

505
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,780
of stealing everyone's work?

506
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,980
After the Moonlight Crown was lost,

507
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,860
your father forbade you
from using its techniques.

508
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,300

00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,540
Now it's been confirmed.

520
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,780
Qipei Pavilion is to be sealed.

521
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,340
What?

522
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,700
Where's the evidence?

523
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
How dare you slander my father!

524
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,540
Slander?

525
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,780
"I, Pei Chufeng, lost my mind"

526
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,500
"and collaborated with the thief Shan Jingtian"

527
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,140
"to steal the Moonlight Crown."

528
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,540
"After getting the treasure, I lived in fear"

529
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,780
"and couldn't live peacefully."

530
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,620
"Aware of my heavy sins,"

531
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,220
"today, I willingly surrender"

532
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,900
"and burn myself in another city to atone."

533
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,740
"I voluntarily return all family assets
to the public."

534
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,060
Recently, the City Lord's confidants received

535
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,060
parts of the stolen Crown and a letter.

536
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,540
Do the handwriting and fingerprints
look familiar?

537
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,540
Hurry. Hurry.

538
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,820
Move.

539
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,820
Copy it.

540
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,060
Copy it.

541
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,340
Don't worry.

542
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,260
I'll clear us.

543
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,220
"I, Pei Chufeng, lost my mind"

544
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,500
"and collaborated with the thief..."

545
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,860
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

546
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,700
You forced me.

547
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,980
Dandan! Dandan!

548
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,260
Ms. Shan fainted!

549
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,900
