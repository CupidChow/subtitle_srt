Is it sweet?

Yes.

28
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,820

is nothing.

(Qipei Pavilion)
Mr. Hao, please let me go.

55
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,300
I have a family

56
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,220
to feed.

57
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,420
Go, go, go.

58
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,380
Don't think I don't know
where you're going.

59
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,420
Madam took you in
when you were at your lowest.

60
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,100
Now that there's trouble,

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,500
you're running to the Su family.

62
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,780
How can you be so ungrateful?

63
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,340
I have no other choice.

64
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,220
Let him go.

65
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,180
Young Master.

66
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,660
(Bright and Perfect)

67
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,620
Young Master, I am deeply sorry.

68
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,780
No need to say more.

69
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,580
It's hard for everyone.

70
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,620
Shopkeeper Hao,

71
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,420
settle his account and let him go.

72
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,140
Go, go, go.

73
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,820
Sorry, Young Master.

74
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,020
Mother, why are you here?

75
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,700
This is my dowry from my wedding.

76
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,100
Use it for emergencies.

77
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,740
No, I can't accept this, Madam.

78
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,140
Why not?

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,940
It's useless sitting here.

80
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,260
Every little bit helps.

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,820
These things are your memories.

82
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,420
You can't lose them.

83
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,180
What's more important

84
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,580
than the people closest to me?

85
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,380
These are just things.

86
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,220
Surviving this crisis is what matters.

87
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,020
No, you can't do this.

88
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,340
Madam,

89
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,340
I don't believe you don't care.

90
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,500
These things must be important to you.

91
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,340
How about this? You keep them.

92
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,380
We'll think of a way together.

93
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,620
We can get through this.

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,540
Madam,

95
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,740
these might be

96
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,020
my dowry one day.

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Please.

98
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,780
It wouldn't be right to sell them.

99
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,180
Alright. We'll keep them.

100
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
I won't sell them.

101
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,460
I won't sell them.

102
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,860
What did you tell my mother?

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,820
- Secret.
- Secret.

104
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,780
Well...

105
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,700
I have an idea.

106
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,140
What? Not making jade anymore?

107
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,500
How can we make jade without jade?

108
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,700
That's not right.

109
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,020
The Qipei Pavilion has been proud
of this for generations.

110
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,180
We can't just give up.

111
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,020
Yes.

112
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,540
We've made jade for generations
because we had jade.

113
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,940
But without jade,

114
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,940
should we starve everyone?

115
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,100
But

116
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,940
isn't this giving in to Su Jue?

117
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,060
No.

118
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
It's not forever.

119
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,980
This is a temporary strategy.

120
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,940
It's a tactical retreat.

121
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,500
Mr. Pei, Dandan is right.

122
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,820
If there's no better solution,

123
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,940
let's find a way

124
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,340
to keep Qipei Pavilion afloat for now.

125
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,780
Right, Young Master.

126
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,900
I think Ms. Shuangshuang is right.

127
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,380
"A wise man does not fight
when the odds are against him."

128
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,300
When we prosper,

129
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,060
we'll buy out Suyu Pavilion.

130
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,140
So you mean

131
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,140
we'll make gold and silver jewelry?

132
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,700
Not just gold and silver.

133
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,580
Stone, wood,

134
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,460
fabric, and even shells.

135
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,660
As long as it's not jade, we'll make it.

136
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,140
Su Jue likes making jade, right?

137
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,500
Let him do it.

138
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
It sounds like

139
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,900
Qipei Pavilion's products

140
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,940
will diversify.

141
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,860
And you've seen
the previous low-cost jewelry

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,900
and scented jade.

143
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,500
The market response was great.

144
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,660
New things

145
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,140
are always popular.

146
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,860
If we specialize in jewelry,

147
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,540
the business won't be worse than before.

148
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,460
Mr. Pei, you're skilled in jade carving,

149
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,340
so gold and silver
should be easy for you.

150
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
I know a bit.

151
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,860
That's great.

152
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
With my sister's designs

153
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,940
and Mr. Pei's help,

154
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,700
we'll produce masterpieces.

155
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,620
As for the craftsmen,

156
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,860
they're almost familiar with it,

157
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,660
so they'll adapt quickly.

158
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,860
As for the shopkeepers and clerks,

159
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,100
they'll manage smoothly.

160
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,380
Everything is ready.

161
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,980
But what about Mother?

162
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Shopkeeper Hao.

163
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,100
Shopkeeper Hao.

164
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,380
Young Master.

165
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,540
Sell all the inventory at a 70% discount,

166
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,660
and then buy some gold
and silver materials.

167
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,780
Sell at a 70% discount?

168
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,420
We have no other choice.

169
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,220
Over a hundred people
in Qipei Pavilion need to eat.

170
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,340
We have to take a chance.

171
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,820
You decide. I'll handle it.

172
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,660
Thank you.

173
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,580
I thought Pei had some backbone.

174
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,540
But he's selling out

175
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,980
his family assets.

176
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,900
That's called karma.

177
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,220
Even if he sells the inventory at a loss,

178
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,420
he can't last without supplies.

179
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,340
So let's watch them run out of resources.

180
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,900
Maybe I should help.

181
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,300
Buy their remaining stock.

182
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,140
And sell it at original prices.

183
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,580
They'll be infuriated.

184
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
Madam,

185
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,820
I made this soup especially for you.

186
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,340
Let me.

187
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,020
It's just made.

188
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
- Is it good?
- Tastes very good.

189
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,980
Have some more.

190
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,420
I'll do it myself.

191
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,780
Alright, alright.

192
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,460
The weather's nice today.

193
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,460
Alright. Sit down.

194
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,180
Dandan,

195
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,540
you want to talk about Qipei Pavilion

196
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,660
switching to gold
and silver jewelry, right?

197
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,820
Are you angry?

198
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,820
Honestly,

199
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,220
I can't let go.

200
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,100
Back then, Pei's father

201
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,260
was in charge of the Crown,
but he lost it,

202
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,340
causing Qipei Pavilion's reputation
to plummet.

203
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,620
A few years later,

204
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
he passed away unexpectedly.

205
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,500
Qipei Pavilion was in debt,

206
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,980
and we had

207
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,540
to pawn our house

208
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,220
and shop.

209
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,860
After repaying the debt,

210
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,260
we were left with nothing.

211
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,620
Everyone in Yuncui City

212
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,180
thought Pei and I

213
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,820
would give up on Qipei Pavilion

214
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,660
and find another way to live.

215
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,420
But I stubbornly held on until now.

216
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,540
Pack up your things and leave.

217
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,020
Not a penny of the rent can be owed.

218
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,980
Sir,

219
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,060
just give me one more month.

220
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,540
I can pay you daily

221
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,340
from the sales.

222
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,100
And after the business is done,

223
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,660
the rent will be paid in full.

224
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,980
You, a woman with a child,

225
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
think you can do business?

226
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,340
I don't believe you can sell anything.

227
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,780
I can do it.

228
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,900
Trust me.

229
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,460
Please give me another chance.

230
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,020
Why should I give you a chance?

231
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,500
Pack up and leave,

232
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,620
- or I'll smash everything.
- Sir.

233
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,540
Please help us.

234
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,380
Sir.

235
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
Mother,

236
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,380
why do we have to do the jade business?

237
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,340
Why do you insist?

238
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,340
Pei,

239
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,500
remember this.

240
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,420
One day, I will

241
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,580
put the Qipei Pavilion sign back up.

242
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,500
No one knows

243
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,420
how much I've suffered,

244
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,340
how many grievances I've endured.

245
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,020
But no matter what,

246
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,580
I held on.

247
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,820
Madam,

248
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,020
you have always been my role model.

249
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,740
Whether in life or in skills,

250
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,340
I've learned a lot from you.

251
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,980
Dandan,

252
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,780
from the moment I saw you,

253
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,940
I chose you for Qipei Pavilion

254
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,300
because

255
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,740
I saw

256
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,860
my younger self in you.

257
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,060
That fearless spirit

258
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,140
is just like mine.

259
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,540
So,

260
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,460
I believe in you.

261
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,300
So you agree to Qipei Pavilion

262
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,940
switching to gold and silver jewelry?

263
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,380
I am old.

264
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,140
I can't hold onto everything.

265
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,180
It's time to let you all take a chance.

266
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,140
Don't worry.
It's just a temporary measure.

267
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,260
We will never give up

268
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,180
the hundred-year reputation
of Qipei Pavilion's jade.

269
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
We just need some time.

270
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,860
I swear.

271
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,620
Qipei Pavilion will shine again.

272
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,700
I will not disappoint you.

273
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,220
Okay.

274
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,140
Really.

275
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,060
I believe you.

276
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,500
Good.

277
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Just trust me.

278
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,980
(Delight and Peace)

279
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,700
(Huaizhou)

280
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,380
(Qipei Pavilion)

281
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,580
It's done.

282
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,420
Looks beautiful.

283
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,700
Ms. Shuangshuang,
may I help you put it on?

284
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,300
Thank you.

285
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
No problem.

286
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,380
No problem.

287
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,540
If it were longer, it would be perfect.

288
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,140
Ms. Shuangshuang,

289
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,180
is this hairpin for yourself?

290
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,180
Of course not.

291
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,460
Every piece

292
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,780
must be tested to ensure its look.

293
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,540
It's responsible for the customers.

294
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,020
You are indeed beautiful and meticulous.

295
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,580
Shuangshuang,
is the brooch I ordered ready?

296
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,460
Here.

297
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,580
So delicate.

298
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,140
As expected from my sister.

299
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,060
Your Mr. Pei designed it.

300
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,380
Stop looking. He is resting.

301
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,060
By the way,
do you know any good clothes shops?

302
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,080
Of course.

303
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,060
The young master's clothes are...

304
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,980
For women's clothes.

305
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,820
Then Fengxiang Pavilion.

306
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,340
It's the biggest women's clothing shop
in Yuncui City.

307
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,260
Madam's clothes are made there.

308
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,340
Is the shopkeeper easy to talk to?

309
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,940
Mr. Zhu is cautious,

310
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,860
always on guard in business.

311
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,740
It's hard to take advantage of him.

312
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,100
Does he have a weakness?

313
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,740
A weakness?

314
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,780
Yes.

315
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,500
You want to play?

316
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,620
Mr. Zhu is busy.

317
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,500
That's his daughter, Xiaodie.

318
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,340
He had her late in life

319
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,700
and spoils her.

320
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,060
He treats her like a treasure.

321
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,540
If she wants something,

322
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,980
even the moon,

323
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,900
he will try to get it for her.

324
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,540
Are you hungry?

325
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,620
Little girl, what's your name?

326
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,460
I'm Xiaodie.

327
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm Dandan.

328
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,460
What are you doing?

329
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,580
I'm playing house.

330
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,980
Is this your princess?

331
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,860
Yes, I'm her mother.

332
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,660
I am my mother's princess too.

333
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,060
Besides making me pretty clothes,

334
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,020
she made me this.

335
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,260
It's beautiful.

336
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,180
Do you want to touch it?

337
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,020
I'll ask my dad to buy it.

338
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,500
My dad is rich.

339
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,580
But this can't be bought with money.

340
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,820
My mother made it especially for me.

341
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,820
I want to buy it.

342
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,380
I want it.

343
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,420
Do you want to touch it?

344
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,180
Is it pretty?

345
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,500
Sweetie.

346
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,060
What's going on?

347
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,380
Mr. Zhu, you're back.

348
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,020
Isn't this Qipei Pavilion's Liu?

349
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,420
This lady

350
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,260
is our Qipei Pavilion's
Deputy Shopkeeper,

351
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,140
Shan Dandan.

352
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,900
Ms. Shan, hello.

353
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
Daddy, I want this.

354
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,780
I want this.

355
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,060
You want this?

356
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,980
- Okay, I'll buy it for you.
- If you like it,

357
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,140
I'll give it to you.

358
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,740
That's too generous.

359
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,780
It seems to be expensive.

360
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,660
How about we pay for it?

361
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Well...

362
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,420
If you don't mind,

363
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,900
let's have some tea.

364
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,940
- Sure.
- Please.

365
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,780
Let's go.

366
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,980
Come on, sweetie.

367
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,340
Come on. Let me hold you.

368
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,780
This way, please.

369
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
Let's go.

370
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,660
Please have a seat.

371
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,500
Sure.

372
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,700
I often hear our madam

373
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,780
praise your shop,

374
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,260
saying your clothes are exquisite

375
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,980
and unique in style.

376
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,900
And Mr. Zhu,

377
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,740
you're so upright and honest.

378
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,260
Even the little princess is so lovely.

379
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,700
Your madam is the remarkable one.

380
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,820
Ms. Shan,

381
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,100
how much does the accessory cost?

382
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,700
Can I buy it from you?

383
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,420
You're an old friend of our madam.

384
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,940
How could I take your money?

385
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,940
If you like it,

386
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,020
I'll give it to our little princess.

387
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,380
Thank the kind lady.

388
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,900
Thank you, Miss.

389
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,740
Do you like it?

390
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,660
I like it.

391
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,580
Put it on and have a look.

392
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,620
- Come.
- Daddy,

393
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,100
does it look good hanging here?

394
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,140
It looks great.

395
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,420
Daddy,

396
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,780
does it look good hanging here?

397
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,100
Ms. Shan, I didn't expect

398
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,700
this little accessory to pair so well

399
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,460
with the clothes.

400
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,580
Our accessories are meant

401
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,660
to complement various outfits.

402
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,140
They're easy to attach,
delicate, and versatile.

403
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,620
Great.

404
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,260
If our clothes had such accessories,

405
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,300
they'd be even more impressive.

406
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,300
Mr. Zhu,

407
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,930
that's a fantastic idea.

408
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,820
Think about it.

409
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,860
Your customers are all wealthy.

410
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,380
They wouldn't mind
paying for such accessories.

411
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,580
And these accessories

412
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,380
truly enhance the clothes.

413
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,380
How about we supply you

414
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,940
with accessories,

415
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,180
and we give you 10%

416
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,660
of the profits?

417
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,860
Well...

418
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,260
Daddy, this is the best.

419
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,140
Can you put it on for me?

420
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,260
Alright.

421
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,100
Let's do as you said.

422
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,180
Great.

423
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,420
Cheers.

424
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,020
So, you're saying

425
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,900
the big deal you made while I was napping

426
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,620
was done by tricking a child?

427
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,500
How could you call it tricking?

428
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,060
It's a strategy.

429
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,860
Besides,

430
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,380
you've called me a little liar
since we first met.

431
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,100
If you call me that again,

432
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
you're dead, Pei Pei.

433
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,300
Little...

434
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,300
Genius.

435
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
Calm down.

436
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,300
Why didn't you just tell him

437
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,100
the cooperation plan directly?

438
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,820
There's a reason for that.

439
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,900
Dealing with someone as cautious as him,

440
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,980
no matter what we say,

441
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,020
he'd think we're tricking him.

442
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,060
Only when it comes from his own mouth

443
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,140
will he feel he's got the upper hand.

444
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,260
You

445
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,700
are too young.

446
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,620
Otherwise, why would I be the shopkeeper?

447
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,020
Got it?

448
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,260
Young Master, eat more.

449
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,300
Thank you.

450
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,060
Young Master, have some vegetables.

451
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,260
These two styles are nice.

452
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,220
We can make more of them.

453
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,700
Young Master, be careful.
Step forward a bit.

454
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,380
Young Master.

455
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,940
This is so beautiful.

456
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,540
Shuangshuang, you're amazing.

457
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,100
This is filigree work.

458
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,980
But this technique
is rarely used in the city.

459
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,300
It's about drawing gold and silver
into fine threads

460
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,460
and then shaping and weaving them

461
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,060
onto other items based on the designs.

462
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,380
It's beautiful, affordable,
and easy to work with.

463
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,460
Ms. Shuangshuang, you truly are talented.

464
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,820
I bet Mr. Pei only needs to see it once

465
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,700
to replicate and teach other craftsmen
for mass production, right?

466
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,020
It shouldn't be difficult.

467
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,260
I think

468
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,100
Qipei Pavilion is becoming more promising.

469
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,220
For the first batch of accessories,

470
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,220
besides focusing on filigree,

471
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,140
I also want to make melted bead earrings.

472
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,500
It's about cutting gold and silver
into small pieces

473
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,460
and then using fire to melt them

474
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,580
into beads of various sizes.

475
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,860
Have you heard of it, Mr. Pei?

476
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
No, I haven't.

477
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,020
What about filigree inlay?

478
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,900
Using gold and silver wires

479
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,620
to form and attach patterns.

480
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,100
Also, no.

481
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,780
(How strange that he doesn't know.)

482
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,220
Shuangshuang, don't make it hard for him.

483
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,780
He's mainly into jade work.

484
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,380
Sorry, my mistake.

485
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,860
Shuangshuang, can I take this?

486
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Of course.

487
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,580
Are you thinking...

488
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,020
Since you've developed this,

489
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
the next step is to open up the market.

490
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,340
Liu, stay here and help my sister.

491
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,660
Young Master and I need to go out.

492
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,220
Alright. Don't worry.

493
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,100
Come back later. No rush.

494
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,740
Don't you think walking

495
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,620
in the rain is romantic?

496
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,060
Aren't we supposed to find customers?

497
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,180
Why are we strolling around?

498
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,460
I've been so tired lately.

499
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,540
Can't I have a break?

500
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,460
Alright. I was just teasing.

501
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,540
Why are you upset now?

502
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,420
You're so petty.

503
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm not upset.

504
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,300
Tell me. What do you want to buy?

505
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,460
I'll get it for you.

506
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,500
Forget it.

507
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,100
Save the money

508
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,700
to make more beads for Shuangshuang.

509
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
Dandan,

510
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,940
I owe you too much.

511
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,220
Why say this suddenly?

512
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,820
Then just owe me for now.

513
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,740
Pay me back tenfold when we succeed.

514
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,180
This one is beautiful.

515
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,860
I'll keep it for myself.

516
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,700
Weren't you just saying
we need customers?

517
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,060
Now you want to keep it for yourself?

518
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm just saying.
Why are you picking on me?

519
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,220
I'm just saying too, teasing you.

520
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,980
I'm teasing you back.

521
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,780
Don't get wet.

522
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,980
(Flower Pavilion)

523
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,300
Please come in.

524
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,500
Do you want to find customers
at Flower Pavilion?

525
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,740
All the guests here are men.

526
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,980
Who would buy hairpins?

527
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,060
Don't men have wives?

528
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,500
And do women need

529
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,060
to buy hairpins themselves?

530
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,300
Besides, I'm not targeting

531
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,540
the guests today.

532
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Do you trust me?

533
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,700
I do.

534
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,340
Then remember to cooperate with me.

535
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,820
Sure.

536
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,940
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

537
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,300
Ms. Lingyuan.

538
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,620
Come in.

539
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,580
You're here.

540
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,420
You heartless man, you dare come?

541
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,100
Kneel.

542
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,860
Kneel.

543
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,740
Ms. Lingyuan,

544
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,260
I brought our young master
to apologize to you.

545
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,100
What?

546
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,060
It's all because of that Suyu Pavilion

547
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,260
who took all the Jade Beauties.

548
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,740
Our young master had no choice

549
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,980
but to come up with that plan.

550
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,740
Suyu Pavilion went too far,

551
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,700
being the dog in the manger.

552
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,740
In the end, they didn't even use you.

553
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,660
Exactly.

554
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,220
Who are you calling the manger?

555
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,340
Ms. Lingyuan,

556
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,980
it's just a metaphor.

557
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,420
Look at you, with such striking beauty.

558
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,180
If you compete for us,

559
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
you'll surely win, right?

560
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,020
You

561
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,500
have a point.

562
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,340
Exactly.

563
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,300
Ms. Lingyuan, look at this.

564
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
Where did this hairpin come from?
It's so beautiful.

565
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,590
Isn't it?

566
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,020
This is our new release,

567
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,500
the Butterfly Gold Hairpin.

568
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,060
It's the only one in Yuncui City.

569
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,180
No, it's unique.

570
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,660
We brought it here for you

571
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,980
as an apology.

572
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,420
Really?

573
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,220
Of course.

574
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,780
We're not only giving you the hairpin

575
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,940
but also money.

576
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,540
What?

577
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,380
Hurry.

578
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,540
Hurry.

579
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,980
Come on.

580
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Ms. Lingyuan,

581
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,140
as long as you wear our hairpin,

582
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,300
the money is yours.

583
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,060
Any customer who buys from Qipei Pavilion

584
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,100
because of the hairpin on you,

585
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,460
we'll give them a 20% discount.

586
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,540
And you'll get a 20% commission.

587
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,380
How about that?

588
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,660
What? Why?

589
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,860
Is there really
such a good deal in the world?

590
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,660
What? You don't want it?

591
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,500
I do. I do.

592
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,180
How could I not want it?

593
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,540
Here, have some pastries.

594
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,500
No need for pastries.

595
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Let me help you put on the hairpin
and take a look.

596
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,420
That would be wonderful.

597
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,260
Alright.

598
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,740
Okay. No need to see us out.

599
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,260
Alright.

600
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,260
You two...

601
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
We're taking a stroll.

602
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,620
Yes, we're just strolling around.

603
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,860
Strolling?

604
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,500
What are you doing?
Let me see what you're planning.

605
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,780
Go, go, go.

606
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,020
Do me a favor.

607
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,700
As the saying goes,

608
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,900
enemies should be reconciled,
not created.

609
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,260
But I just saw him

610
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,220
flirting with that little wench.

611
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,500
Watch your mouth.

612
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,340
Kneel.

613
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,020
This...

614
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,280
- Ms. Huadian.
- What's going on?

615
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,540
Come on. Have a seat.

616
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,060
I brought

617
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,540
our young master to apologize to you.

618
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,260
We were just passing by Lingyuan's room,

619
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,740
and she dragged us in.

620
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,300
We've just explained everything.

621
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,820
Don't lie to me.

622
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,020
I saw the hairpin in Lingyuan's hand.

623
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,540
That hairpin was meant for you too.

624
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,740
The Butterfly Gold Hairpin is too elegant

625
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,380
for her vulgar makeup.

626
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,180
Don't say that.

627
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,980
Lingyuan isn't as vulgar as you think.

628
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,260
Yes, yes. You're the kindest.

629
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,180
But don't worry.

630
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,580
We have something even better.

631
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,140
Better? What could it be?

632
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,540
Some kind of bead?

633
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,030
Melted beads.

634
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,380
Yes, melted beads.

635
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,020
Yuncui City has never
seen such accessories.

636
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,700
They're exquisite and unique.

637
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,860
Rest assured.

638
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,940
I'll send someone to deliver them

639
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,980
to your boudoir tomorrow.

640
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,460
That's too generous.

641
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,340
I'll have to accept it then.

642
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Of course.

643
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,820
But...

644
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,540
But what?

645
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,260
Ms. Lingyuan said

646
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,740
that any accessories she wears

647
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,220
will become the latest trend.

648
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,260
So she requested

649
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,620
a 20% commission

650
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,260
for any sales through her.

651
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
What?

652
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,820
She doesn't deserve that.

653
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,140
Everyone knows

654
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,660
I'm the most sought-after lady.

655
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,620
Exactly.

656
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,100
How about this?

657
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,980
For any customers

658
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,700
who buy... What is it?

659
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,780
Melted beads.

660
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,660
If they buy them from me,

661
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,900
I'll only take a 10% commission.

662
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,700
If my sales are less than Lingyuan's,

663
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,140
I'll...

664
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,780
I'll bash my head against the wall.

665
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,900
Alright.

666
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,980
I'll give your customers a 20% discount.

667
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,620
That's too kind.

668
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,500
- May we cooperate well.
- May we cooperate well.

669
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,700
May we cooperate well.

670
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,860
(Flower Pavilion)

671
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,100
A man's knees are worth gold.

672
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,020
Did you know?

673
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,100
You're wise, very wise.

674
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,940
Indeed.

675
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,020
Look, with just a couple of kneels,

676
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,020
we've made thousands of taels.

677
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,140
A real man can learn to adapt.

678
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,180
You made me kneel. Fine.

679
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,020
But what kind of lousy idea was this?

680
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Making a loss-making deal,

681
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260
we still have to share profits with them.

682
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,980
How can you be so smart

683
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,820
yet make such a simple mistake?

684
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,980
We can raise the price

685
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,020
by 20%.

686
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,260
But if we raise it by 20%,
won't we sell less?

687
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,180
Look at their daily viewership.
It's high.

688
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,860
And they're popular.

689
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
Their selling power is huge.

690
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,780
In the future, Lingyuan and Huadian

691
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,340
will be the sales queens
of Qipei Pavilion.

692
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,500
I don't believe it. You're always...

693
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,340
Oh, my!

694
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,940
Have you seen my hairpin?

695
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,700
It's the first in the city.

696
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,420
With my recommendation,

697
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,460
you can get a 20% discount
at Qipei Pavilion.

698
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,500
What are you waiting for?

699
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,420
Hurry and order for your wives.

700
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,340
Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.

701
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,100
Hurry and order.

702
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,140
Young Master.

703
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,740
These are the accessories
hand-carved by Pei Pei,

704
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,500
found on Qipei Pavilion's shelves.

705
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,500
Leave them here.

706
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,660
Yes.

707
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,700
Not that impressive.

708
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,980
How did he manage such intricate carving?

709
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,180
(How much is Pei Pei hiding?)

710
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,460
(Could it be that
I'm truly inferior to him?)

711
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,620
(A few days later)

712
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,420
(Huaizhou)

713
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,860
He hasn't arrived yet.

714
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,620
Don't worry. Keep waiting.

715
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,140
Shopkeeper Shan.

716
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,420
- How many?
- How many?

717
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,580
We've tallied all the shops.

718
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,180
Through various channels, there's a total

719
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,740
of 2,600 orders.

720
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,820
Congratulations, Shopkeeper Shan.

721
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,220
Congratulations to you too.

722
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,100
Compared to Qipei Pavilion's jade sales,

723
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,660
how much less is our profit?

724
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,700
If this sales trend continues,

725
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,980
we'll almost break even.

726
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,740
Let's go. We've got a lot to do now.

727
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,140
Why that face?

728
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,340
Shouldn't you be happy?

729
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
I don't want to break even.
I want to surpass.

730
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,620
I'll surpass the past Qipei Pavilion

731
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,220
and the current Suyu Pavilion.

732
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,900
Don't worry.

733
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,940
I'll fight this battle with you.

734
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,940
Alright. A total of ten designs.

735
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,780
Great.

736
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,740
Why do you need so many drafts?

737
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,260
To spread the word.

738
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,220
Good morning, Dandan.

739
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,300
Morning.

740
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,310
Good morning, Ms. Shuangshuang.

741
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,630
Ms. Dandan,

742
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,220
are you meeting with Mr. Tan today?

743
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,100
Yes. Shuangshuang, I'm heading out now.

744
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
Goodbye.

745
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,100
Take care.

746
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,340
Ms. Shuangshuang,

747
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,620
here's a meat zongzi for you.

748
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
It's the only one left.

749
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,900
I was afraid Dandan would snatch it.

750
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,980
Eat it while it's hot.

751
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,820
Thank you.

752
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,060
Eat it while it's hot.

753
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,340
- Mr. Tan.
- Ms. Dandan.

754
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,620
How have you been?

755
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,900
The past is the past.

756
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,420
It's just fleeting smoke.

757
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,980
It makes me cherish
the present even more.

758
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,580
Since I'm alive, I should live well.

759
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,540
That's the spirit.

760
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,140
Here are the drafts.

761
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,740
I'll pick them up after they're done.

762
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,860
Thank you.

763
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,100
Don't worry.

764
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,020
Leave it to me.

765
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,980
I'll treat you to a big meal afterward.

766
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,300
What big meal are you having?

767
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,140
Count me in.
