=Episode 13=

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,040
We've been walking all night.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,340
Why aren't we there yet?

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,390
Hang in there.

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,670
We should be close.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,770
Everything looks the same.

28
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,500
It feels like we've passed this place before.

29
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,470
The paths are tough to walk here.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,930
Yes.

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,980
Be careful, Dandan.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,750
Look ahead.

33
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,780
Another intersection?

34
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,900
Do you smell that?

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,890
What is it? It smells so good.

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,730
Right.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,550
It does smell good.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,520
(The Pei family is also tracking)

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,660
(the news of the Crown.)

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,080
(Forget it.)

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,370
(As long as I survive,)

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,500
(I can slowly investigate.)

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,380
(Better than let the Su family's jerks
kill me.)

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,590
Where's this smell coming from?

45
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,490
Here you go.

46
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,550
Chase me!

47
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,900
Wait for me.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,470
Got you.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,590
Come on.

50
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,100
Young Master.

51
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,500
Young Master.

52
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,990
Do you like it?

53
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,900
Young Master.

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,660
Cuiliu.

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
Hey.

56
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,470
Haven't I told you before?

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,800
From now on,

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,220
stay away from the Pei family.

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,780
Fend for yourself.

60
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,960
Why are you so annoying?

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Cuiliu.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,060
Annoying.

63
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,750
What are you doing?

64
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,190
You just called out Cuiliu.

65
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,120
I...

66
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,190
Do I look like Cuiliu?

67
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,500
What just happened?

68
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,460
I don't know either.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,310
It seems we've been drugged by Lost Soul.

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,670
Where's Liu?

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,110
Shuangshuang.

72
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,820
Shuangshuang.

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,350
Liu, wake up.

74
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,530
Liu.

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,230
Liu.

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,140
Get up.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,810
Young Master, Dandan, what is this?

78
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,820
A grown man acting like this? Come on.

79
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,360
Ms. Dandan,

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,750
What happened to me?

81
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,790
We've been drugged.

82
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,870
Forget it. Let's hurry and leave.

83
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,290
Let's go.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Let's go.

85
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,680
Young Master.

86
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,450
- Over there.
- Slow down.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,700
Looks like someone got here before us.

88
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,310
It must be the one who drugged us.

89
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,170
Young Master.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,310
Look at this.

91
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,730
This...

92
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,970
What's wrong?

93
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,350
The micro-carving on this jade key

94
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,820
is a family heirloom skill of the Pei family.

95
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,810
Who could mimic this craft

96
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,380
so perfectly?

97
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,700
We were too careless.

98
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,040
Someone must have spread the fake news

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,990
to lure us here.

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,210
They suggested the key to the Crown cave

101
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,580
came from the Pei family.

102
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,550
We just happened to arrive here at midnight.

103
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,750
If we encounter others,

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
we won't be able to clear our name then.

105
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,790
So despicable.

106
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,190
Who could be so malicious?

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,430
So, the person

108
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,720
who drugged us

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
to trap us in the woods

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,620
actually saved us?

111
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,380
We can't be sure if he's a friend or foe

112
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,870
Who helped us?

113
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,520
Let's just head back first.

114
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,580
If we run into anyone,

115
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,230
we won't be able to explain.

116
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,140
- Let's go.
- Go.

117
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,610
How is it?

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,400
The poison in Mr. Su's body is almost gone.

119
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,700
He won't die.

120
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,460
That's good.

121
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,230
The poison is almost gone or completely gone?

122
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,190
He won't die.

123
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,350
Will it harm his body?

124
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
Well...

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,940
Ms. Shuangshuang.

126
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,610
Shopkeeper Wang.

127
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,500
I've been by the Young Master's side every day.

128
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,500
Do you think I would harm him?

129
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,750
Of course not.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,570
May I ask why Young Master

131
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,350
got so severely injured?

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
He...

133
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,870
It was an accident.

134
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,730
Really?

135
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,550
Never mind. I was just being nosy.

136
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,140
Poison not removed fully can cause problems.

137
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,260
The doctor should know that.

138
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,210
Yes, yes.

139
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,790
So medicine alone

140
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,550
can't completely cure it.

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,280
Yes, yes, yes.

142
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,350
Sure, sure.

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
What's this?

144
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,310
This is the finest red jade powder,

145
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,570
ground from high-quality jade.

146
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,220
Apply it daily to avoid scars.

147
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,910
As a jade expert, Shopkeeper Wang,

148
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,510
you should know

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,980
jade can remove scars.

150
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,060
Yes, yes. I know.

151
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,650
Thank you.

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,190
Mr. Su is a respectable man.

153
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,120
A clean life

154
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,790
should have no blemishes.

155
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,450
Yes, yes.

156
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,790
The poison is removed,

157
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,510
so I'll take my leave.

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,310
Shuangshuang,

159
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,410
I was wrong.

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Don't move.

161
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,700
I was wrong.

162
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,430
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,220
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,670
I don't understand.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,790
He means

166
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,480
Suyu Pavilion treated you

167
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,460
too...

168
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,790
Uncle, I must say it.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,030
I was wrong.

170
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,270
I apologize.

171
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,580
We suspected you.

172
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,940
I believed others' rumors

173
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,580
and set this trap for you.

174
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,550
Shuangshuang, do you know?

175
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,940
When I saw it wasn't you behind the mask,

176
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,740
I was so relieved.

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,980
Since it was a misunderstanding,

178
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,640
why do you need to bring it up?

179
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,700
You're right.

180
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm a respectable man.

181
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,630
A clean life

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,700
should have

183
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,390
no blemishes.

184
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,460
In your world,

185
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,700
I can't have any stains.

186
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,460
Mr. Su, you haven't fully recovered.

187
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,220
You should rest early.

188
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,060
What's this little pain?

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,310
This wound is nothing.

190
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,460
If it clears your name,

191
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,980
I can take thousands of wounds.

192
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,670
If you truly care about me,

193
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,670
then recover soon.

194
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,210
(The Su family already suspects)

195
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,550
(my identity and motives.)

196
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,940
(The Pei family is under suspicion too.)

197
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,790
(It seems it's time to end this.)

198
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,150
The micro-carving on this jade key

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,580
is a family heirloom skill of the Pei family.

200
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,450
Who could mimic this craft

201
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,060
so perfectly?

202
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,060
What are you thinking?

203
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,630
Do you think

204
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,940
it was the Su family?

205
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,860
I'm not sure.

206
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,840
In Mr. Tan's case,

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,220
Su Jue put in a lot

208
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,190
of effort and help.

209
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,550
Considering my sister's favor,

210
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,550
he shouldn't be so ruthless.

211
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,430
You can't judge a book by its cover.

212
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,570
The Moonlight Crown

213
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,860
is being brought up again.

214
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,190
I have a bad feeling.

215
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,100
Alright.

216
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,860
We're fine now.

217
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,640
The scented jade market has opened up.

218
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,820
My sister is coming to help at Qipei Pavilion.

219
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,270
Everything is going well.

220
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,760
Don't worry so much.

221
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,150
Leave tomorrow's troubles for tomorrow.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,860
Comforting doesn't work.
You want me to scold you?

223
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,480
Alright, let me ask you.

224
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,460
What did you call me in the woods yesterday?

225
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't remember.

226
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,060
Wasn't I poisoned yesterday?

227
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,340
Don't remember? Poisoned?

228
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,100
I think that's why you told the truth.

229
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,060
What did I say?

230
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,720
Were you thinking of Cuiliu?

231
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,960
No, no, no.

232
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,950
- No?
- It hurts.

233
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,690
What did you call me in the woods yesterday?

234
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,040
What did I call you? I really don't remember.

235
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,670
You kept calling out Cuiliu, Cuiliu.

236
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,240
You were so flirtatious.

237
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,100
Were you thinking of her?

238
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,410
I...

239
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
I wasn't, Dandan.

240
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,480
I was wrong. I really was wrong.

241
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,760
- You were wrong?
- I was wrong.

242
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,860
Now it hurts?
Why didn't you think of that before?

243
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,430
I was really wrong, Dandan. Come on.

244
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
Alright.

245
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,190
What did I say?

246
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,270
Stop laughing.

247
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,080
Stop laughing.

248
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,080
Stop looking.

249
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,460
(Zhang's Fabric Shop)

250
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,540
(Huaizhou)

251
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,580
(Su's Mansion)

252
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,700
Young Master.

253
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,460
You're still recovering.

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,180
What are you doing?

255
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,300
Qipei Pavilion received an award.

256
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,860
I unjustly blamed you.

257
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,780
I even suspected you

258
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
of causing trouble for the Su family.

259
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,660
I was so wrong.
I don't know how to make up for it.

260
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,900
Luckily,

261
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,540
the Mandarin Ducks arrived.

262
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,900
Consider it compensation.

263
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,540
Mr. Su.

264
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,820
During the Jade Competition, I said

265
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,300
the Mandarin Ducks were made for you.

266
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,620
But the gilding and crystal cover

267
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,180
took some time.

268
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,140
Now it's returned to its rightful owner.

269
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,980
What did I do

270
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,460
to deserve this?

271
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,740
Since you first entered Suyu Pavilion,

272
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,860
you caught my attention.

273
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,180
You're not only talented

274
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,580
but also virtuous.

275
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,620
With you by my side at the Jade Competition,

276
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,380
we won so easily.

277
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,260
These days, facing hardships with you,

278
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,820
I've realized

279
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,980
how important you are to me.

280
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,340
I've made up my mind.

281
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,860
I want to spend my life

282
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,540
with you.

283
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,910
Shuangshuang,

284
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
will you marry me?

285
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,780
I will treat you well for life.

286
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,980
Mr. Su,

287
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,940
I think you misunderstand.

288
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,940
I've never thought of you
as a romantic partner.

289
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,260
How could that be?

290
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,900
You treat me so well.

291
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,900
Are you still upset

292
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,540
because I wronged you?

293
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,980
Mr. Su, you're overthinking.

294
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,820
I don't care what others think of me.

295
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,540
I see you as a master. Nothing more.

296
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,420
I... I...

297
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,660
I proposed too hastily.

298
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,870
How about this? Next time,

299
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,540
I'll give you another winning piece.

300
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,380
Or,

301
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,060
I'll share all the wealth

302
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,780
of Suyu Pavilion with you.

303
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,020
Is it because

304
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,540
of Qipei Pavilion's success today?

305
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,260
Do you worry about Suyu Pavilion's decline?

306
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,620
Rest assured, Shuangshuang.

307
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,260
As long as I'm here,

308
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,660
we will always be the top in Yun Cui City.

309
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,820
Mr. Su,

310
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,100
whether I like you or not

311
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,860
has nothing to do with these things.

312
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,380
Like these eyeless mandarin ducks.

313
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,540
Choosing a partner

314
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,780
isn't based on these things on the surface.

315
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,060
Don't you understand?

316
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,900
Also,

317
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I came here today

318
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,540
to tell you

319
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,260
I'm grateful for your kindness

320
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,380
and care these days.

321
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,620
But

322
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,580
I might have to resign.

323
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,780
After much thought,

324
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,140
I want to stay with my sister.

325
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,620
Please allow it.

326
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,380
Are you saying

327
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,420
you want to work for the Pei family?

328
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,900
Why do this to me?

329
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,740
I've been so good to you.

330
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,940
Why choose Qipei Pavilion,

331
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,540
our enemy?

332
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,420
Everyone has their fate.

333
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,020
Our paths are set

334
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,500
by the heavens.

335
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,620
Mr. Su,

336
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,780
I'm grateful to you,

337
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,460
but

338
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,940
please let me go.

339
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,740
So,

340
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,860
you've made up your mind.

341
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,660
Mr. Su,

342
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,460
Su Jue.

344
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,140
Father.

345
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,300
Go to the back hall
and practice with your master.

346
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,900
If you can't defeat the Pei family's son,

347
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,300
I can only

348
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,380
disown you.

349
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,220
Father.

350
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,460
Why?

351
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,940
Must you take away

352
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,140
all my happiness?

353
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,580
Pei Pei.

354
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Qipei Pavilion.

355
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,420
I won't let you go.

356
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,540
I won't let you go.

357
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,940
Young Master,

358
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,580
This is Ms. Shuangshuang,
applying for a silver craftsman position.

359
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,060
I saw you embracing Mr. Tan,

360
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,940
being all lovey-dovey.

361
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm jealous, resentful, and envious.

362
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,700
Is that okay?

363
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,980
It's really interesting.

364
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,300
Two eyeless mandarin ducks

365
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,940
leaning on each other.

366
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,180
Intriguing, out of the ordinary.

367
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,780
(Suyu Pavilion)

368
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,180
What's this?

369
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,660
What craftsmanship is this?

370
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,540
Sandalwood, peach blossom,

371
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,980
pear, and iris.

372
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,740
The same scents over and over.

373
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,700
So boring.

374
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,620
Indeed.

375
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,860
It's unreasonable

376
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,140
for us to use the same scented jewelry

377
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
as those common women

378
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,540
on the street.

379
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,500
You ladies are right.

380
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,900
But it takes time
for our partnered perfume shop

381
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,020
to develop new scents.

382
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,380
And merging fragrances with jade

383
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
isn't an easy task.

384
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,500
So...

385
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,220
What's so difficult?

386
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,940
You're just stalling.

387
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,820
Go get our old friend, Madam Pei.

388
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,500
We don't want to waste time talking to you.

389
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,780
Madam Pei, she...

390
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,580
What's going on here?

391
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,100
My beautiful

392
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,420
and graceful noble ladies.

393
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,280
What seems to be the matter?

394
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,020
Isn't this the maid who played mahjong

395
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,420
with us last time?

396
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,500
I remember.

397
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,460
She won quite a lot of money from us.

398
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,300
That's right.

399
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,740
Ms. Dandan

400
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,300
is now the Deputy Shopkeeper of Qipei Pavilion.

401
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,660
From now on,

402
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,940
if you have any requests

403
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,500
or are dissatisfied with anything,

404
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,980
you can just tell me.

405
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,620
First, congratulations on your promotion.

406
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,020
Thank you.

407
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,260
But as I said,

408
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,220
we don't like these common pieces

409
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
- of jewelry.
- Indeed.

410
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,700
Do you have any unique fragrances?

411
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,340
Yes, of course.

412
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,220
Given your noble status

413
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,360
and your long-standing friendship

414
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,580
with Madam Pei,

415
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,500
these ordinary pieces

416
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,100
surely don't match your stature.

417
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,900
However...

418
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,260
What is it?

419
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,060
To blend special fragrances into jade

420
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,900
is very costly.

421
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,420
So, the price

422
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,580
would be several times higher
than the ordinary ones.

423
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,780
As long as we're satisfied,

424
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,020
it doesn't matter if it's several times,

425
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,020
or even hundreds of times more expensive.

426
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,500
After all,

427
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,260
we're here to support

428
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,380
our old friend's business.

429
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,460
But you must make sure

430
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,120
we are happy.

431
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,100
- That's right.
- Alright.

432
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,740
I will have my people
start the development immediately

433
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,580
and deliver them to your residences soon.

434
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,020
I guarantee your satisfaction.

435
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,940
Alright.

436
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,660
We'll be waiting.

437
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,020
- Please, take care.
- Let's go.

438
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,900
- Be careful.
- Hurry with the development.

439
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,740
Don't worry.

440
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,060
Ms. Dandan, Ms. Shuangshuang is here.

441
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,100
My sister is here,
and you're more excited than I am.

442
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,860
No, I'm not.

443
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,460
Shuangshuang, it's wonderful.

444
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,940
We're finally reunited.

445
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,100
Yes, we can be together now.

446
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,740
Mr. Pei, I'm sorry to trouble you.

447
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,700
Ms. Shuangshuang, there's no need to say that.

448
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,980
Your help is a blessing

449
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,260
to Qipei Pavilion.

450
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,380
Young Master, I'll take my sister to her room.

451
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,420
Let's go, Shuangshuang.

452
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,300
Young Master, I'll be going too.

453
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,740
Shuangshuang, you're staying over there.

454
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,900
Be careful, Ms. Shuangshuang.

455
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,060
Just over there.

456
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,980
Alright. Let's turn here.

457
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,780
Shuangshuang.

458
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,220
Have a seat.

459
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,940
It's so great that you're here.

460
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,260
Now we can talk more at night.

461
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,420
Yes, we can finally live together.

462
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,500
But didn't Madam Pei promote you
to Deputy Shopkeeper?

463
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,340
Why are you still staying
in the servants' quarters?

464
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,180
The young master wanted to move me,

465
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
but I feel comfortable here.

466
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,500
It's spacious enough,

467
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,260
more than our home.

468
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,140
Shuangshuang, are you not used to it?

469
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,740
I can talk to the young master.

470
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,020
Silly girl.

471
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
When have I ever cared about such things?

472
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
I'm worried you'll be mistreated.

473
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,100
Me?

474
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,140
I'm not mistreated. I'm doing well here.

475
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,500
Liu, Liu!

476
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,740
I'm here.

477
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,420
Is the workshop ready?

478
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,220
Yes. Do you want to check it now?

479
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,300
- Sure. Let's go.
- Alright.

480
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,700
Be careful, Shuangshuang.

481
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,740
She's here.

482
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,580
Get ready.

483
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Welcome, Ms. Shuangshuang!

484
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,740
Welcome!

485
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,620
Hello, everyone.

486
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,100
Ms. Shuangshuang, this way.

487
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,860
Here. This way.

488
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,980
Ms. Shuangshuang, you'll be working here.

489
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,220
I've already tidied it up for you.

490
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,260
And since it is getting colder,

491
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,500
I've prepared a cushion for you.

492
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,660
Be careful not to catch a cold.

493
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,260
That's thoughtful of you.

494
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,820
Look at Liu.

495
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,420
When did you become so caring?

496
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,820
I... I didn't.

497
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,820
Ms. Shuangshuang,

498
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,260
I've learned about your work at Suyu Pavilion.

499
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,340
This time, I won't change it.

500
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,740
Shuangshuang, now that you're here,

501
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,940
you'll mainly be responsible
for designing gold and silver jewelry.

502
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,820
As for jade designs,

503
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,580
you can join us if you wish.

504
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,940
I'll start with gold and silver

505
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,100
since I'm best at gold and silver inlay.

506
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,420
Ms. Shuangshuang is right.

507
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,100
Jue,

508
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,260
you haven't eaten all day.

509
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,660
Are you trying to starve yourself to death?

510
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
I have no appetite.

511
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,820
Is she worth it?

512
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,500
You're the top jade master of Yuncui City.

513
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
If you want,

514
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,100
countless women are willing to be with you.

515
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,540
The top jade master.

516
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,900
The top jade business.

517
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,860
What's the use of that?

518
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,500
I've worked hard with your mother
since we were young.

519
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
Now I support you.

520
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,020
But if you continue like this,

521
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,940
how can I face her?

522
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,060
If you're capable,

523
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,860
take her back.

524
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,100
Or, if Qipei Pavilion didn't exist,

525
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
where else could she go?

526
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,260
Dandan, can I come in?

527
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,780
Come in.

528
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,020
Didn't you say before

529
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,840
There's nothing wrong
with courageously pursuing love?

530
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,340
And a young man's feelings deserve respect?

531
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,540
Wait.

532
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,580
Liu,

533
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,780
we're really not suitable for each other.

534
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,700
It's not us two.

535
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,020
Ms. Shuangshuang must be exhausted

536
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,300
after working all day.

537
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,900
This is ginseng from the madam.

538
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,700
Please give it to her.

539
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,900
Let her replenish her energy.

540
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,940
It's not me.

541
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,060
Liu,

542
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,460
this must've cost you a lot.

543
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
But

544
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,740
it's just her first day here.

545
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,860
- You...
- Also.

546
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,140
And this too.

547
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,980
It's also for her.

548
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,020
- Got it.
- Will you help me?

549
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,260
Sure.

550
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,460
Got it.

551
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,340
Dandan.

552
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,500
Is he alright?

553
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,460
He's fine.

554
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,260
Shuangshuang.

555
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,300
What's this?

556
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,820
Take it.

557
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,860
It seems he is very sincere.

558
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,740
What do you think?

559
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,740
I don't have the heart for romance right now.

560
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,100
I'd rather focus on helping you
with the business.

561
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,460
Shuangshuang, I can see

562
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,020
that Mr. Su

563
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,460
also has feelings for you, right?

564
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,060
He may have feelings, but I cannot reciprocate.

565
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
In the end, it's just hurtful.

566
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,660
Indeed.

567
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,140
These things can't be forced.

568
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,060
Let things take their course.

569
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,900
I really hope to see you

570
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,180
in bridal attire with a phoenix crown.

571
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
You'd be beautiful.

572
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,820
By the way, you always mention
the Moonlight Crown.

573
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,540
What kind of treasure is it?

574
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,660
I've heard of its legend in the martial world,

575
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,620
but it seems you're very familiar with it.

576
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,980
Back then, Master Pei, as the chief designer,

577
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,540
crafted the Moonlight Crown,

578
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,500
intended as a tribute to the Empress.

579
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,940
But it was stolen en route.

580
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,740
Many lives were lost because of it.

581
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,620
I see it as a curse

582
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,740
rather than a treasure.

583
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,660
The Moonlight Crown

584
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,940
incorporates the master skills

585
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,100
of renowned craftsmen

586
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,140
from all over the country,

587
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,460
most of which are now lost.

588
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,580
Even the gems on the crown

589
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,020
have disappeared.

590
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,100
You said Master Pei was the chief designer,

591
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,900
so our Mr. Pei must be very skilled too.

592
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,460
Some techniques used on the Moonlight Crown

593
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,620
were beyond even Master Pei.

594
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,220
Let alone Pei Pei, who was just a child then.

595
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,820
His extraordinary skills now

596
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
are rather surprising.

597
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,660
Other people

598
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,020
inherit skills from their parents,

599
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,340
but our parents left me

600
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,620
a lucky stone.

601
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,780
Shuangshuang,

602
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,940
do you think

603
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,580
it could be their love token?

604
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,580
Dandan,

605
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,020
I'm a bit tired.

606
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,540
Let's rest for now.

607
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,660
Alright.

608
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,780
I've made the bed.

609
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,940
Shuangshuang, I'll sleep with you tonight.

610
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,140
Wait for me.

611
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,900
Be careful. Don't fall.

612
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,260
(Qipei Pavilion)

613
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,300
Shuangshuang.

614
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,820
Liu.

615
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,380
Both the names represent double digits.

616
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,700
Shuangshuang.

617
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,460
Liu.

618
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,260
So realistic.

619
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,540
Liu?

620
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,940
Liu?

621
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,060
Ms. Shuangshuang.

622
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,140
Where are Dandan and Shopkeeper Hao?

623
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,980
They had to go out.

624
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,340
But it's alright.

625
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,340
Dandan said if you need anything,
you should come to me.

626
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,340
I've hit a bottleneck in my designs.

627
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,260
Most of the techniques I used to know
are at Suyu Pavilion.

628
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,740
So I was thinking.

629
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,980
Could I look at some

630
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,540
of Qipei Pavilion's previous works

631
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,580
for inspiration?

632
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,900
Where are the historical records

633
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,580
usually kept?

634
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,940
Can I have a look?

635
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,900
We do have such a place.

636
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,020
No problem.

637
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,860
I'll take you there.

638
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,100
Ms. Shuangshuang, follow me.

639
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,620
Ms. Shuangshuang, this way, please.

640
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,980
Ms. Shuangshuang.

641
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,500
This shelf here

642
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,140
contains the jade masterpieces
and techniques from various dynasties.

643
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,180
And this shelf

644
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,660
has the top carving techniques
from famous masters,

645
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,700
collected from all over

646
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,020
and printed into books

647
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,660
to be stored here.

648
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,820
This one here is quite impressive.

649
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,020
This shelf contains
the accumulated craftsmanship

650
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,620
of Qipei Pavilion's predecessors.

651
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,380
It's perfect for study.

652
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,420
"The carved rails
and the marble steps must remain

653
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,820
unchanged, but not her beauty."

654
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,740
"But not her beauty..."

655
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,620
-Beauty...
- Alright.

656
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,100
I'll look on my own.

657
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,060
Sure. Call me if you need anything.

658
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,780
By the way, Ms. Shuangshuang.

659
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,650
Ms. Shuangshuang.

660
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,220
I see you are as gentle as jade.

661
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,500
You probably won't shout.

662
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,540
Here.

663
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
Take this.

664
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,980
If you need anything, just ring it.

665
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,140
I'll come right away.

666
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,220
No one else has this.

667
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,940
Of course.

668
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,220
You don't have to use it if you don't need to.
