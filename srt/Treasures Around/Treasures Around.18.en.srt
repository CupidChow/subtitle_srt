23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,970
Useless!

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,280
I have failed you.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
Young Master,

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,640
I was very discreet.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,240
Si Ruyu will not discover our identity.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,490
We still have a chance.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,640
Chance?

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,880
Tell me.

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
What chance do we have?

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,690
You've failed repeatedly.

33
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,440
What use are you to me?

34
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,850
Young Master,

35
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,960
doesn't this prove my determination?

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Chance.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,170
Since you mentioned chance,

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,240
I'll give you one more chance.

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,610
Before we leave Yuncui City,

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
He must die.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,490
Mr. Su from Suyu Pavilion

43
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,120
is here to see Mr. Si Ruyu.

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,210
Please inform him.

45
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,290
Mr. Si isn't here.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,290
He went out early with our young master.

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,400
Maybe you should ask again.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,290
I told you he's not here. Go back.

49
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,130
Thank you.

50
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,360
Young Master, I asked around.

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
They said Mr. Si wasn't there.

52
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,170
He went out early with Mr. Pei.

53
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,840
He's not here? Did you confirm?

54
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,130
Yes.

55
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,010
Forget it.

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Keep your mouth shut.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
Yes.

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,290
(What is he doing looking for Si Ruyu?)

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,490
(Could it be...)

60
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,840
- You're drunk.
- Leave me alone.

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,400
I can still drink.

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,930
What's going on?

63
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,960
I saw Yingying poison him yesterday,

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,890
but I don't know who ordered it.

65
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,730
Then we discussed

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,080
setting a trap for them

67
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,400
to give them a chance.

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,490
But it seems like Mr. Si

69
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,210
already knows

70
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,490
who's behind the maid.

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
It's my brother.

72
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,290
What?

73
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,450
My brother and I are close in age.

74
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,490
Though he is older,

75
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,760
our father has always treated us equally.

76
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,050
But my brother doesn't think so.

77
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,530
He believes our father favors me.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,120
I never took it seriously,

79
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,570
until

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,360
I lost my wife and child.

81
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,760
You mean your wife and child died because...

82
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,170
I'm not sure.

83
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,200
My late wife was a maid,

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
but Si Ruchu is my father's son.

85
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,680
Father hesitated for a long time

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,410
and begged me to step aside.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,120
So,

88
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,000
now I act

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
like a useless playboy

90
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,440
to protect myself

91
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,800
and avoid conflict with him.

92
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,360
I've made so many compromises.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Why does he still press me so hard?

94
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Seems he's truly behind this assassination.

95
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,930
We can test him.

96
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,200
We won't harm innocent people,

97
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,000
but tit for tat is fair play.

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,050
If this was indeed his doing,

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
by indulging him,

100
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,090
you're only harming him.

101
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
Don't worry.

102
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,200
If you want to solve this,

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,530
we'll help you.

104
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,010
Shuagnshuang,

105
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,200
do you think there are really

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,610
such heartless people in this world?

107
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,000
Someone who would kill their own brother?

108
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
The world is vast.

109
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,530
There are all kinds of people.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Alright.

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,050
Weren't you going to discuss

112
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,240
the Su family's banquet with me?

113
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,970
Do you have any good ideas?

114
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,850
I want to invite Master Si.

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,090
Invite him?

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,120
You want him to suppress Si Ruchu?

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,600
It'll be hard for us to invite him over,

118
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,930
and how can you be sure

119
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,050
Master Si will side with Mr. Ruyu?

120
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,930
The current rumors

121
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,290
favor Si Ruchu

122
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,050
as the preferred heir.

123
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
Moreover, at that time,

124
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,170
didn't he also tell Mr. Ruyu

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,350
not to pursue charges against Ruchu?

126
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,410
Now, we have only Si Ruyu's words.

127
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,880
If Master Si were to decide

128
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,200
and support the Su family with Si Ruchu,

129
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,970
I'm afraid this plan

130
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,530
might backfire.

131
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,850
But I don't think Si Ruyu is lying.

132
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,970
Master Si didn't pursue it then

133
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,440
because he didn't want to drag his son down

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,410
over outsiders.

135
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,850
But if it threatens

136
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,120
his other son's life,

137
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
it would be different.

138
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,440
If the maid is indeed sent

139
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,440
by Si Ruchu,

140
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,050
then he must see Si Ruyu as a mortal enemy.

141
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,450
Why would a prospective heir

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
want to kill

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,940
a supposedly harmless playboy?

144
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,050
There must be

145
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,090
something unusual going on.

146
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,170
So, what's your plan?

147
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,340
(Zhang's Fabric Shop)

148
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,360
Have you heard? The two young masters

149
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,650
from the Miner Si family are in Yuncui City.

150
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,810
I've heard

151
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,290
Many villains have their eyes on them,

152
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,650
hoping to make a big score.

153
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,490
I think

154
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,530
it's better to be an ordinary commoner.

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
Who knows what kind of grudge

156
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,350
someone holds against the Si family,

157
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,850
wanting to kill the two young masters?

158
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,010
Exactly.

159
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
Eat up.

160
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
(Now the martial world is abuzz)

161
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,680
(with the talk of assassinating)

162
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,120
(the Si brothers.)

163
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,800
(Si Ruchu will surely believe it.)

164
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,480
(I'll wait for him to reveal his true colors.)

165
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,420
(Si Mansion)

166
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,050
Master, a letter has arrived from Yuncui City.

167
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,680
I've heard you are a jade enthusiast.

168
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,530
Currently, in Yuncui City,

169
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
there is an extremely rare

170
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,650
sky-blue ice jade stone.

171
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,770
Please come and see it.

172
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,010
Respectfully, the Master of Qipei Pavilion.

173
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,680
Qipei Pavilion?

174
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
(Fengyue Teahouse)

175
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,230
Mr. Su, when did you arrive?

176
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,230
It's rare for you to seek me out.

177
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,750
I apologize for the lack

178
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,820
of a proper welcome.

179
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,940
What do you mean by that, Mr. Si?

180
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,150
Mr. Su, don't pretend to be ignorant.

181
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,350
Everyone knows

182
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,700
the fence-sitters fall easily.

183
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,440
Are you here

184
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,110
to tell me

185
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,650
rumors are rampant in Yuncui City,

186
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,640
because the mine owner's two young masters

187
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,540
are in the city,

188
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,060
attracting assassins?

189
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,300
They want to kill us.

190
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,170
Our father is old

191
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,130
and cannot withstand such shocks.

192
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,510
The mastermind would then

193
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,700
benefit from this chaos,

194
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,660
and take our mines.

195
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,890
Yes.

196
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,230
So, you already know that.

197
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,940
Though I don't go out,

198
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,630
I have my sources.

199
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
So,

200
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,580
you went to see Si Ruyu.

201
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,530
You're worried our alliance won't hold,

202
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,150
so you sought extra assurance.

203
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,300
No, I had no such intention.

204
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,250
- I just...
- You just thought

205
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,010
if both Si brothers

206
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,170
are on your side,

207
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,370
no matter who wins,

208
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,870
you'll benefit, right?

209
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,270
But you don't know

210
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,940
the person I despise most is Si Ruyu

211
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,900
and those who betray me.

212
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,780
Mr. Si,

213
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,900
I never thought that.

214
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,720
I know little about the situation

215
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,990
between you two.

216
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,050
I just thought

217
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,680
having him stay with you

218
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,030
would be more convenient.

219
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,820
You should know

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,440
the truth in your heart.

221
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,420
I do.

222
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,540
I just ask you one thing.

223
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,630
In this bet,

224
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,660
are you betting on him or on me?

225
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,300
Everyone knows that Si Ruyu is a wastrel.

226
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,700
The whole world knows

227
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,780
the heir to your family's wealth is you.

228
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,510
Both publicly and privately,

229
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,780
I must follow you.

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,160
Good.

231
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,390
I want you to do me a favor.

232
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,030
If you do,

233
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,940
I'll forgive and forget.

234
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,180
Between us, there's no need for favors.

235
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,300
Just say it.

236
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,700
It's not difficult.

237
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,420
I want you to help me

238
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,470
kill Si Ruyu.

239
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,300
Have you thought this through?

240
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,370
The news of Si's young masters being hunted

241
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,410
has already spread.

242
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,180
Now there's no turning back.

243
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
Mr. Pei,

244
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,940
after these days together,

245
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,180
I've considered you a friend.

246
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,700
Tell me.

247
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,780
If I do this,

248
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,630
will my father be disappointed in me?

249
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,770
We merely invited Master Si here

250
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,660
to create a scenario.

251
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,270
It's up to them

252
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,700
to take the bait.

253
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,150
It'll be their choice.

254
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,780
Even if it disappoints Master Si,

255
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,660
knowing the truth early

256
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,750
is better than being deceived forever.

257
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,890
Don't worry.

258
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,870
I hope he'll stop at the brink.

259
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,390
Actually, I have another task for this trip.

260
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,640
Everyone knows

261
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,350
our Moshan mines produce excellent jade.

262
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,660
But in recent years,

263
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,470
good Moshan Jade has become scarce.

264
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,540
My father, a jade enthusiast,

265
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,870
has come to see money as secondary.

266
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,820
Since my brother took over,

267
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,230
he's been selling good jade

268
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,420
at high prices to amateurs

269
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,820
while secretly

270
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,820
drawing other mine owners into our business.

271
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,150
So you asked me

272
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,030
if I truly love and cherish jade

273
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,890
and if I'm genuinely capable.

274
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,230
This is my father's task for me.

275
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm glad

276
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,850
there are still people in the industry like us

277
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,900
who uphold our principles.

278
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,580
Though the Pei family now needs support,

279
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,300
given our relationship,

280
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,180
we won't turn a blind eye.

281
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,060
Your matter is more pressing.

282
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,470
He is your brother.

283
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,580
So what?

284
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,030
Are you saying

285
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,700
I'm too heartless?

286
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,750
Si Ruyu has been a playboy since childhood,

287
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,230
yet our father still treasures him.

288
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,510
I've seen Pei Pei's jade carving skills.

289
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,600
Now you want to monopolize supplies

290
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,930
to undermine him.

291
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,410
You know

292
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,230
the reason, right?

293
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,110
If my father meets Pei Pei,

294
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,750
our alliance might end.

295
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,750
Will he supply you

296
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,630
or the Pei family?

297
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,630
You and I are in this together.

298
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,300
So, will you help yourself,

299
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,990
or pity a stranger's life?

300
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,780
What do you plan to do?

301
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,870
I've received word.

302
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,560
The Pei family has invited my father here

303
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,780
to seek justice for them.

304
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,990
Conveniently, rumors say

305
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
assassins

306
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,030
are targeting me and my brother.

307
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,660
Why not go with the flow?

308
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,900
Have our people blend in,

309
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,470
kill him, injure me,

310
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,780
and blame it on the assassins.

311
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,180
Kill two birds with one stone.

312
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,540
When will you act?

313
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,470
The Su family banquet is soon.

314
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,110
A perfect time

315
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,300
with a mixed crowd.

316
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,290
And a few days later,

317
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,030
my father will arrive in Yuncui City.

318
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,150
By then,

319
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,470
Si Ruyu will likely be dead.

320
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
Mr. Su.

321
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,610
Please.

322
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,420
(December 6th)

323
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,630
So everything is set?

324
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,490
Don't worry.

325
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,840
I dare not neglect

326
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,680
your request.

327
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,300
It's not time for the banquet yet.

328
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,090
Why are you two here so early?

329
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,990
Aren't you here even earlier?

330
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,570
Oh, as the host,

331
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,810
you must have many things to arrange.

332
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,750
Of course.

333
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,190
This is hosted by Suyu Pavilion.

334
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,340
I can't let anything go wrong.

335
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,560
Where's Ruyu?

336
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,650
Today, Mr. Ruyu has some important matters

337
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,960
with Yingying and Yanyan.

338
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
He'll be late.

339
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,370
He asked me to apologize to Mr. Ruchu

340
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,210
on his behalf.

341
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,820
How disrespectful.

342
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,100
Making me wait here.

343
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,650
Mr. Si,

344
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,190
the first meeting was hasty.

345
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,890
Our young master wants to discuss

346
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,380
jade matters with you.

347
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,040
Have a seat.

348
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,100
Are you worried

349
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,230
I'll steal your lifeline,

350
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,860
so you've hidden Mr. Ruyu at your house?

351
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,010
Nonsense.

352
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
Do you think we're as despicable as you,

353
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,240
- using any means necessary?
- You

354
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
What? Are you disappointed

355
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,750
that Mr. Ruyu isn't here, Mr. Su?

356
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,200
You're overthinking it.

357
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,960
As my close friend,

358
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,570
it's natural for him

359
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,060
to care about my brother.

360
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,030
You wish for Si Ruyu's downfall, don't you?

361
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,300
What do you mean, Mr. Pei?

362
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,780
I don't understand.

363
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,380
Who's been falsifying accounts

364
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,100
and taking over other jade mines
behind Master Si's back?

365
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,030
Where's your principle

366
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,200
about Moshan Jade

367
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,390
and only selling it to connoisseurs?

368
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,710
Mr. Pei, stop slandering me.

369
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,200
You killed your sister-in-law

370
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,230
while she was pregnant

371
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,240
and arranged for spies to poison your brother.

372
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,670
Mr. Si, you did it, right?

373
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,410
Don't accuse me without evidence.

374
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,410
Si Ruyu's wife died from a hemorrhage.

375
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,440
What does that have to do with me?

376
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,000
And as for poison, I've never heard of it.

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,950
After committing such heinous acts,

378
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,100
do you feel no remorse at all?

379
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,240
I live an upright life

380
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,930
and conduct my business fairly.

381
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,030
What is there to regret?

382
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,230
What if we have evidence?

383
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,000
Upright and fair?

384
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,470
Who's boasting now?

385
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,620
Si Ruchu,

386
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,330
you must have seen the tattoo

387
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,780
on Yingying.

388
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,270
You forced her to kill Mr. Ruyu,

389
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,750
didn't you?

390
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,780
Nonsense.

391
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,200
She tattooed my name

392
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,510
out of affection.

393
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,140
What she does

394
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,780
has nothing to do with me.

395
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,130
Young Master, how can you say that?

396
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,890
I only followed your orders.

397
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,730
Nonsense!

398
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,690
This...

399
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,340
Yes.

400
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,990
You're right.

401
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,710
It was me.

402
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,820
I faked the accounts.

403
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,950
I swallowed up the mines.

404
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,710
I planted spies by his side

405
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,950
to watch him.

406
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,250
By the way,

407
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,270
I also poisoned him.

408
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,710
This fool was lucky

409
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,060
and survived,

410
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,620
though his wife wasn't so lucky.

411
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,750
That's why she and her child died.

412
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,100
I was going to put on another show for you,

413
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,380
but

414
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,430
there's no need now.

415
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,430
Since you're all

416
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,380
so eager to meddle,

417
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,030
I'll settle this once and for all.

418
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,860
No one will leave here alive today.

419
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,470
You'll all die.

420
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,470
Does that include me?

421
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,410
Father.

422
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,430
Master Si can only know the situation
when he's here.

423
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,760
I've already sent a letter

424
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,860
by express messenger.

425
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,720
On December 9th,

426
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,780
Master Si will arrive on time.

427
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,620
December 9th is for viewing jade,

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,340
December 6th is to save Ruyu.

429
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,930
As long as Master Si brings enough people

430
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,770
and arrives early,

431
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,280
Mr. Si can explain

432
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,540
everything to him.

433
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,230
At the banquet,

434
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,780
we can expose Si Ruchu's plot

435
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,080
and catch him red-handed.

436
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,620
Is that true?

437
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,930
It's true.

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,140
I heard it myself.

439
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,410
Father, even now,

440
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,480
you don't believe us?

441
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,330
It's not that I don't believe you.

442
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,270
I can't believe this beast

443
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,950
is so ruthless.

444
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,470
A brilliant plan,

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,270
killing you and injuring him.

446
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,470
Master Si, what about now?

447
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,100
As you say.

448
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,040
Be careful.

449
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,710
Don't cause any deaths.

450
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,380
Don't worry. We won't.

451
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,190
Liu, stay safe.

452
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,970
Father.

453
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,890
Father, it's not what you think.

454
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,230
It's not what you think.

455
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,090
Father, let me explain.

456
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,190
It's not what you think.

457
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,620
I wanted to give you another chance,

458
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,380
but you refuse to repent.

459
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,030
repeatedly trying to kill your brother.

460
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,990
Master Si, welcome.

461
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,340
As the host, I'm sorry for the poor reception.

462
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,340
You're too kind, Mr. Su.

463
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,820
I came uninvited.

464
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,430
I hope you don't mind.

465
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,280
You're joking. How could I?

466
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,620
It's my fault for not being thorough.

467
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,470
Not being through?

468
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,850
If this isn't thorough, then what is?

469
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,380
None of your business.

470
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,000
I just wanted to host a banquet

471
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,300
for the Si brothers.

472
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,330
How could I know Si Ruchu was so vicious?

473
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,230
Su Jue, you...

474
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,410
Enough!

475
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,410
You beast.

476
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,710
Despite the age difference with Ruyu,

477
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,850
I have never

478
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,340
mistreated you.

479
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,090
You had everything your brother had,

480
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,540
even more.

481
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,720
But now, for your own gain,

482
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,820
you swallow family and other mines,

483
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,990
ignoring brotherly bonds.

484
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,710
What a sentimental brother you are.

485
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,580
Father,

486
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,950
I know I was wrong.

487
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,100
Please give me another chance.

488
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,950
From today,

489
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,580
Si Ruchu loses all management rights

490
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,990
and is never to leave Modu.

491
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,020
(Pei's Mansion)

492
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,240
Thanks to Mr. Pei

493
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,270
and Ms. Shan's help,

494
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,470
we avoided a disaster.

495
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,860
I'm deeply grateful.

496
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,190
Master Si, you're too kind.

497
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,680
Helping each other is normal.

498
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,090
Indeed. Besides,

499
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,040
Si Ruyu is like a brother to us.

500
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,880
It's our duty.

501
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,620
I heard that Ruchu

502
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,750
disregarded our heritage,

503
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,200
trying to monopolize seven mines

504
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,040
and selling high,

505
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,820
ruining Moshan Jade's reputation.

506
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,710
I sent Ruyu

507
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
to find the reason and evidence

508
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,340
to protect our name,

509
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,620
not expecting this rebellious son

510
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,060
to go mad.

511
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,490
Father,

512
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,280
you've been finding the best jade
for the best artisans,

513
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,130
so Modu can make the best pieces.

514
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,140
Mr. Pei...

515
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,200
I've admired

516
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,380
Pei Chufeng's craftsmanship for years,

517
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,230
but we've never met.

518
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,990
For years,

519
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,510
Qipei Pavilion's been making jade pieces.

520
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,270
Some of your stones were from our mines.

521
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,910
You're in trouble now.

522
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,060
Of course, I know.

523
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,950
Please help us.

524
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,580
By law,

525
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,510
mines can only supply local stone stores,

526
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,470
with strict quality and quantity control.

527
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,270
Don't you know this?

528
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,300
Of course, we do.

529
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,140
I can see the Pei family is both dedicated

530
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,430
and talented.

531
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,340
Since I can't supply you with jade stone,

532
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,140
I'll supply your stone store.

533
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,060
What?

534
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,170
Qin Shiliu's Jade Shop

535
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,240
is my largest agent in four cities nearby,

536
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,090
but he only seeks

537
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,620
immediate profits.

538
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,470
I've had enough.

539
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,680
If you don't mind,

540
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,520
you'll be my new agent

541
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,510
in Yuncui City.

542
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,090
Don't worry about the permit.

543
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,430
I'll go to the City Lord.

544
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,380
Really?

545
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,750
We'll have a jade stone store now?

546
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,340
Am I dreaming?

547
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,060
It's true.

548
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,170
Alright.

549
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,300
It's getting late.

550
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,230
We should head back to Modu

551
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,230
to deal with family matters.

552
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,330
Ruyu.

553
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,170
Dad.

554
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,670
It's all in the past.

555
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,320
Let's go.

556
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,540
I'll see you off.

557
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,600
Let's go.

558
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,430
One, two, three.

559
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
We've won!

560
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,140
Our rebirth in the jade industry
is just around the corner.

561
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,010
Shuangshuang.

562
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,320
They're coming.

563
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,290
Mother.

564
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,520
Madam.

565
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
Mother, what's wrong?

566
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,990
The guest just left.

567
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,440
Madam, Master Si has agreed.

568
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,930
I already know.

569
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,280
Liu heard it at the door

570
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,860
and couldn't wait to rush back to tell me.

571
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,750
Thank you.

572
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,470
My great shopkeeper and contributor.

573
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,600
It's my duty.

574
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,670
But today,

575
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,670
I have something more important to discuss.

576
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,990
Ms. Li.

577
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,170
This is Phoenix Wedding Dress.

578
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,230
I wore it when I got married.

579
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,910
I've kept it all this time.

580
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,990
Now it should change owners.

581
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,910
Pei, silly child.

582
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,380
Do you want me to give it to Dandan?

583
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,800
Dandan.

584
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,430
I...

585
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,270
Say it.

586
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,540
Shan Dandan,

587
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,620
will you marry me?

588

603
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,660
(Suyu Pavilion)

604
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,370
Si has provided jade for Pei

605
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,860
and opened a jade stone shop for them.

606
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,930
Look.

607
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,910
This is from the spy in the Pei family.

608
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,300
Si Ruchu is really useless.

609
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,370
He's willing to kill his own brother.

610
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,570
So malicious.

611
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,240
But in the end, he achieved nothing.

612
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
Exactly.

613
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,370
It would've been better if he hadn't come.

614
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,270
Look at it now.

615
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,130
Not only did the Pei family get jade,

616
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,820
but they also gained a jade stone shop.

617
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,610
From now on, good goods

618
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,820
will be picked by them first.

619
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,030
No, I need to think of a way.

620
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,270
Mr. Su,

621
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,910
today I want to tell you

622
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,190
I see you as a master. Nothing more.

623
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,890
I'm grateful for your kindness

624
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,580
and care these days.

625
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,580
But I might have to resign.

626
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,950
Why?

627
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,670
Why exactly?

628
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,380
Actually,

629
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,910
I'm with Mr. Pei now.

630
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,620
Would you oppose it?

631
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,380
Silly girl.

632
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,230
I'm only glad that you're happy.

633
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,340
Shan Dandan,

634
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,060
will you marry me?

635
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,430
Yes, I will.

636
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,090
Hello, Madam.

637
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,030
Ms. Shuangshuang.

638
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,820
Why are you here alone?

639
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,910
I have some free time

640
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,670
to enjoy the moon.

641
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,100
You've been here for some time.

642
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,510
Are you used to it?

643
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,270
Thank you for your concern.

644
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,470
Everything is good.

645
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,380
I've relied on your help a lot lately.

646
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,860
I haven't had the chance to thank you properly.

647
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,140
Madam, don't mention it.

648
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,860
These are all things I should do.

649
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,750
There's no such thing in this world.

650
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,910
Look how thin you are.

651
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,960
It's been cold lately.

652
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,190
You must take care of yourself.

653
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,280
Ms. Li.

654
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,580
These are the medicinal herbs I've got.

655
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,990
Best for nourishing vitality and blood.

656
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,000
- Here.
- Madam.

657
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,910
Isn't this for the young master?

658
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,360
Take it.

659
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,580
Madam, I can't accept that.

660
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,470
It's better to give it to Mr. Pei.

661
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,640
We are all family.

662
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,310
What's the difference who gets it? Here.

663
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,440
Take it.

664
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,990
Hold it steady.

665
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,320
Let's go.

666
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,640
Ms. Shuangshuang,

667
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,080
are you waiting for Dandan here?

668
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,700
No, I'm waiting for you.

669
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,100
Can we speak privately?

670
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,770
Of course.

671
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,260
I'm happy to oblige.

672
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,470
Then let's change to another place.

673
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,540
Thank you, Ms. Shuangshuang.

674
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,330
Ms. Shuangshuang.

675
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,990
Feel free to ask me anything.

676
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,740
You've grown up with the young master.

677
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,600
I want to ask you about the past.

678
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,470
About the past?

679
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,080
They say Master Pei was more renowned

680
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,510
than Su Zhiyan back in the day.

681
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,880
But now...

682
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,740
That's right.

683
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,560
Our master

684
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,370
was once bold

685
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,730
and talented.

686
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,830
He cared for our young master deeply.

687
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,030
But then, suddenly,

688
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,330
he became unpredictable

689
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,140
and forbade Mr. Pei from touching jade.

690
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,060
After the missing Moonlight Crown?

691
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,480
Yes.

692
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,160
Back then,

693
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,690
the master and other artisans

694
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,330
were arranged to live outside the city

695
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,290
to design the Crown.

696
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,730
But soon after it was completed,

697
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,870
it was stolen on the way to tribute.

698
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,370
Since the Crown was lost,

699
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,180
the master became particularly cautious.

700
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,220
He stopped using the techniques from the Crown

701
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,770
and wouldn't let Mr. Pei show

702
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,140
the skills he grasped by accident

703
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,220
to outsiders.

704
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,960
So you're saying

705
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,330
after the Crown was lost,

706
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,440
Master Pei had the most techniques

707
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,330
but didn't want anyone to know?

708
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,540
Could it be...?

709
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,600
That's a dangerous statement.

710
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,310
Stealing the Crown is a capital crime.

711
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
No matter how precious the gems are,

712
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,140
the money was still limited.

713
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,370
Only someone

714
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,640
who values the techniques would dare to steal.

715
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,540
So it's likely someone from the industry.

716
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,730
Ms. Shuangshuang,

717
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,950
I'm just a servant.

718
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,580
I don't understand these things.

719
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,580
I'm just guessing randomly.

720
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,770
Today's conversation

721
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,580
should just be between us.

722
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,740
Of course.

723
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,440
Ms. Shuangshuang.

724
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,140
Have some tea.
