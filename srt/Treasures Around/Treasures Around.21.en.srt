23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,930
It's come to this.

24
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,650
If you're hiding anything,

25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,490
just tell me.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,770
Such big talk.

27
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,300
Curious, aren't you?

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,530
Why I'm so skilled?

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,490
Like you,

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,930
I learned from my father since childhood.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,360
And my father was Shan Jingtian,

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,460
the infamous thief
who conspired with Pei Chufeng

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,770
to steal the treasure.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
What?

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,740
The infamous thief.

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,060
Quite a notorious title.

37
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,760
In Jiangnan, everyone knows

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830
Shan Jingtian was a martial arts master

39
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,900
and a hero who helped the poor,

40
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,770
yet after years of seclusion,

41
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,770
he ended up with such a reputation.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,060
Then why did your father

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,110
steal the treasure with mine?

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,210
Why?

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,530
You should ask your father.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,350
When I was young,

47
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,300
my mother had an incurable disease.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,460
A mysterious person told my father

49
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,150
that the water amber of the Moonlight Crown

50
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,650
contained ancient holy water

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,860
that could cure all diseases.

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
In desperation, my father believed him

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,210
and stole the treasure.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,860
However,

55
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,280
the amber cure was a lie.

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,690
After the theft, my father

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,090
was killed to silence him.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,200
From then on, my father was branded a thief,

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,360
while your Pei family

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,970
held all the skills and treasures.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,790
My family was ruined,

62
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,020
all thanks to your Pei family.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,970
Shuangshuang, stop.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Shuangshuang,

65
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,300
so many years have passed.

66
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,650
Even if everything back then was true,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,660
Pei Pei knew nothing.

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,130
We're all victims here.

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,490
Our father in heaven

70
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,250
wouldn't want you to do this.

71
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,980
He's my father,

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,220
not yours.

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,370
You're a good child.

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,780
Your mom and I may leave before you.

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,250
I have a request.

76
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,100
Dad, tell me.

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,930
The escort commander for the Crown
died because of me.

78
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,890
I was deceived,

79
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,670
implicating innocent lives.

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,250
I feel guilty.

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,640
Dad,

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,420
what do you want me to do?

83
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,780
Shuangshuang,

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,980
this is his orphaned daughter.

85
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,890
Sending her back now

86
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,430
would bring death.

87
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,490
In this harsh winter,

88
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,660
if you can't send her back...

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,100
Dad.

90
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,570
I hope you

91
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,130
can adopt her

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,860
and treat her as your own sister.

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Dad!

94
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,060
Dad!

95
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,930
Dad!

96
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,620
Dad!

97
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,620
Dad! Dad!

98
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,450
Dad!

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,220
She's Guard Zhao's daughter.

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,860
Your father died because of mine.

101
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,100
It's also my fault.

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,870
But all these sins

103
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,370
stem from his father's actions.

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,540
Now is the time you know the truth.

105
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,960
Will you still protect

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,570
the enemy's child?

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,370
Shan Dandan!

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,440
Oh, no.

109
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,330
I should call you Zhao Dandan.

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,930
In that case...

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Dandan!

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,860
If you want to kill him,

113
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,300
you have to kill me first.

114
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,450
He's just the enemy's child.

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,100
The enemy is already dead.

116
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,890
Shuangshuang,

117
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,100
let it go.

118
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,890
We are inseparable sisters.

119
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,060
(Peace and Tranquility)

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,810
(Suyu Pavilion)
Sir, welcome.

121
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,570
It was so easy.

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,810
The Pei family is done for.

123
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,750
Without Qipei Pavilion,

124
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,960
our business should do better, right?

125
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,300
Look at those spoiled nobles
supporting Pei Pei.

126
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,350
Can they still be cocky?

127
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,690
All his skills are for nothing.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,300
What a pity.

129
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,600
Shuangshuang.

130
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,220
You're back. Have you eaten?

131
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,420
I have.

132
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,370
- Shuangshuang.
- What happened to your hand?

133
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
It's nothing.

134
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,150
I have something to do.

135
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,230
I'm going out.

136
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,810
Where are you going? Stop.

137
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,240
Sit down.

138
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,000
You're always

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,330
making me worry. Give me your hand.

140
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,690
You never take care of yourself.

141
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,730
Always getting hurt.

142
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,900
It must hurt.

143
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,850
Bear with it.

144
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,000
You're reckless and careless,

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,970
without caring for your health.

146
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,960
If you don't cherish yourself,

147
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,140
who will?

148
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,140
Shuangshuang.

149
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,180
Does it still hurt?

150
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,430
Dandan.

151
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,640
Dandan, what's wrong?

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,970
Did something happen?

153
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,300
I lost today's business again.

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,500
As long as you're safe,

155
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,140
we can always start over.

156
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,110
We used to sew pillows and soles for others.

157
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,570
We managed to survive, didn't we?

158
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,690
But when will I become a jade appraiser?

159
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,660
Silly girl, don't rush.

160
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,060
You'll become a jade appraiser one day.

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,260
It'll be soon.

162
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,970
Remember

163
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,930
how you cheered me up?

164
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,930
Life

165
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,140
throws many challenges at us

166
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,330
without giving us answers.

167
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,330
All we can do is face them,

168
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,500
endure them,

169
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,900
and overcome them.

170
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,300
I'll always be with you, Dandan,

171
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,540
just like you were with me.

172
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,180
Why did things turn out like this?

173
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,970
Everything

174
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,060
changed so quickly.

175
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,570
I have nothing left.

176
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,180
My sister.

177
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,570
The one who loved me the most.

178
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,420
She doesn't want me anymore.

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,610
But she's still the one who loves you the most.

180
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,260
She can't bear to hurt you.

181
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,300
You just need to give each other some time.

182
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
By the way,

183
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,450
I haven't thanked you yet.

184
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,780
Thank you.

185
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,730
For what?

186
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,500
For always protecting me.

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,090
And for trusting me.

188
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,900
Then I should thank you too.

189
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,060
I know

190
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,180
you're a victim too

191
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,300
during the incident.

192
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,780
You've endured a lot of pressure,

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,210
yet you still came to comfort me.

194
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,660
I hated my father,

195
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,060
but from my earliest memory,

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
he was proud

197
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,900
and dedicated to jade carving.

198
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,300
He wouldn't steal the treasure.

199
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,500
Besides,

200
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,500
he knew those skills

201
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,850
before the Crown.

202
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,590
The chance to submit the Crown

203
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,610
and gain endless fame was within reach.

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,020
Why would he risk it all

205
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,020
just to monopolize a few skills?

206
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,090
But have you ever thought about this?

207
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,570
If we really are enemies,

208
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,300
can you still accept me?

209
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,850
Right now,

210
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,540
besides you,

211
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,450
I have nothing.

212
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,730
Suddenly I have two fathers

213
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,260
I've never even seen.

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,450
Where does this hatred come from?

215
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,780
If I must hate,

216
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,570
I only hate fate for treating me this way.

217
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,940
(Pei's Mansion)

218
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Shopkeeper Hao.

219
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,690
Young Master.

220
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,470
How's everything?

221
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,850
All the workers and maids have been dismissed.

222
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,970
The other shops have been closed down.

223
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
We

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,020
have nothing left.

225
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,180
Luckily, the City Lord
didn't go all out against us.

226
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,810
He left us a place to stay,

227
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,300
so at least we have a roof over our heads.

228
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,690
What's your plan now?

229
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,780
I'm not going anywhere.

230
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,300
If I must die, I will die in Qipei Pavilion.

231
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,690
This is my savings.

232
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,540
Use it to cover our household expenses.

233
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,330
Shopkeeper Hao, we can't accept this.

234
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,610
Young Master.

235
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,140
Young Master, I'm back.

236
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,830
Where did you go?

237
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,380
I went to buy groceries.

238
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,970
Where did you get the money?

239
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,430
I've been saving my monthly allowance

240
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,930
for a wedding.

241
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,920
They confiscated your property,

242
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,590
but they forgot about us servants.

243
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,780
Now, I'm richer than you.

244
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,690
Shopkeeper Hao, give me a hand.

245
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,450
Take it.

246
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,540
(Seems like we need to find a way)

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
(to make some money.)

248
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,390
Dandan!

249
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,570
He's just the enemy's child.

250
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,450
The enemy is already dead.

251
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,300
Shuangshuang,

252
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,690
let it go.

253
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,670
Don't I have my kind-hearted, good-natured,

254
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,330
and elegant sister?

255
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,190
You're my only sister.

256
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,460
Of course, I'll spend my money on you.

257
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,230
As long as you're happy,

258
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,780
of course, I won't oppose it.

259
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,810
He's my father,

260
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,260
not yours.

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,410
Oh, no.

262
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,540
I should call you Zhao Dandan.

263
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
(Flower Pavilion)

264
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,850
Madam Yang, have some tea.

265
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,920
Let me help you.

266
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,030
Madam Yang, here's the thing.

267
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,680
Besides selling wine,

268
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,400
you only offer snacks

269
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,850
like sunflower seeds and peanuts.

270
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,470
What if a customer

271
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,880
wants a hot meal,

272
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,540
like braised pork?

273
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I have an idea.

274
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,600
I've arranged with Mr. Wang from the west side.

275
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,160
He'll provide hot meals at a low price.

276
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,940
I'll handle the delivery

277
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,060
and take 1% of the profit.

278
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,220
It's a great deal for you.

279
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,460
If you don't do it, you'll lose out.

280
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,810
Well.

281
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,070
That's a pretty good idea.

282
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,910
Right?

283
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,850
But the Pei family committed a crime.

284
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,160
If I do business with you

285
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,330
and get implicated,

286
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,850
what will happen to my business?

287
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,160
Forget it.

288
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,130
I can't do it.

289
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
Just go back.

290
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,020
Madam Yang.

291
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,650
250 taels.

292
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,600
130 taels.

293
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,170
What's this?

294
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,510
Jewelry, 100 taels.

295
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,650
I'll take my leave.

296
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,650
This...

297
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,320
This deal offers too little.

298
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,700
We're out.

299
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,220
Don't pretend with me.

300
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,780
I heard everything.

301
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,230
They're too snobbish.

302
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,750
They were interested

303
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,130
in my meal delivery before.

304
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,330
Now they don't want to do this?

305
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,980
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,270
Why apologize?

307
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,570
We're family.

308
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,550
Alright.

309
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,000
Let's go.

310
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,540
(Jade Shop)

311
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,430
Do you think he'll pay us?

312
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,940
We gave him a deposit last year.

313
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,230
They ran out of stock,
so they should compensate us.

314
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,130
It won't be much,

315
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,460
but it should sustain us for a while.

316
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,220
Darling. I'm coming.

317
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,780
What distinguished guests.

318
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,330
Mr. Qin.

319
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,920
Darling.

320
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,890
Mr. Qin.

321
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,850
Mr. Pei,

322
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,030
didn't you open your own jade stone store?

323
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,160
Why are you here?

324
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,940
I have no stock.

325
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,470
Since you have no stock,

326
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,060
return the deposit from last year.

327
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,890
What bad luck.

328
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,980
Who said we have no stock?

329
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,070
Darling.

330
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,570
- Cuiliu?
- Cuiliu?

331
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,080
How dare you call me that?

332
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,710
I'm now Mr. Qin's second wife

333
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,800
and the mistress of this jade store.

334
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,320
As a relative of a criminal,

335
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,700
you should be polite to me.

336
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,570
Disgusting.

337
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,750
Why weren't you given a heavy sentence?

338
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,470
Disgusting, disgusting.

339
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,600
Who told you to speak?

340
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,440
Shut up.

341
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,190
Beast.

342
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,170
No matter who you are,

343
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
you should return our money.

344
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
You paid the deposit.

345
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
Why should we refund?

346
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,920
That's what the deposit means, right?

347
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,540
You ran out of stock.

348
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,460
We have stock.

349
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,500
We don't.

350
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,510
Mr. Pei, what stone do you want?

351
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,670
Just pay the rest,

352
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,130
and we'll provide it immediately.

353
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,780
Right, Qin?

354
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,800
Yes, my darling said we have stock.

355
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,130
So, we have stock.

356
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,750
What? No money?

357
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,230
If you can't pay the rest,

358
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,190
the deposit won't be refunded.

359
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,220
Not refunded.

360
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,570
Unless...

361
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,810
Unless what?

362
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,330
Unless Mr. Pei kneels beside me

363
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,360
and massages my shoulders and legs.

364
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,570
Then I'll return the money.

365
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,330
Dandan, want to join?

366
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,610
This is Cuiliu?

367
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,440
Isn't she the maid we kicked out

368
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,020
from Qipei Pavilion?

369
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,170
Now she's the second wife here.

370
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,460
Mr. Qin,

371
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,670
how old are you today?

372
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,880
Over fifty, right?

373
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,610
No, forty-nine.

374
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,710
Cuiliu, congratulations.

375
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,320
Marrying a man in his prime.

376
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
You...

377
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,710
In his prime, in his prime.

378
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,740
- In his prime.
- Stop it.

379
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,810
Wish you happiness.

380
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,960
Let's go.

381
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,790
Shameless.

382
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
Shameless.

383
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,410
No, I...

384
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,640
Calm down, calm down.

385
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,500
Calm down.

386
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,650
What are you laughing at?

387
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,780
I'm laughing

388
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,080
because even though we're in dire straits,

389
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,130
you're still so unruly.

390
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,960
I'm penniless now,

391
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,750
just like when I first came to Qipei Pavilion.

392
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,030
Back then, I was a fearless troublemaker.

393
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,320
I can cry and be heartbroken

394
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,030
for you and Shuangshuang.

395
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,700
Now this Cuiliu is taunting me.

396
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,810
Time is a circle.

397
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,060
We're back where we started.

398
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,810
What circle?

399
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,550
If we can't find work,

400
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,170
we'll have to beg for food.

401
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,750
Come on. Let's go.

402
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,950
(Suyu Pavilion)
Come on in.

403
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,890
Come in and take a look.

404
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,740
What? Shuangshuang left the Pei family?

405
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,460
It's true.

406
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,780
Is it because Qipei Pavilion fell?

407
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,980
Shuangshuang isn't like that.

408
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,890
Spare no expense.

409
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,710
Hire professionals to find her.

410
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,840
Use any means necessary.

411
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,700
We must find her.

412
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,920
Yes.

413
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,220
The meal is ready.

414
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,550
Noodles are here.

415
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,390
Time to eat.

416
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,120
Coming.

417
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,260
Smells so good.

418
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,020
Young Master, let me help you.

419
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,850
Eat now. I'm starving.

420
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,940
What's wrong? Don't like it?

421
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,160
Times are tough.

422
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,640
We have to endure for now.

423
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,330
How could I not like it?

424
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,410
I just feel guilty

425
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,890
making you suffer

426
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,980
with me.

427
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,410
Qipei Pavilion is in such a state,

428
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,780
yet you all stayed with me.

429
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,850
I don't know what to say.

430
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,430
It's nothing.

431
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,600
I've lived through hard times since childhood.

432
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,710
It's nothing, right, Liu?

433
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,850
Right, Young Master.

434
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,080
We've endured hardship since we were kids.

435
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,030
Without you,

436
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,800
where would our good lives come from?

437
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
Besides,

438
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,600
we follow the Pei family

439
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,810
not just for comfort.

440
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,990
Young Master, we're family.

441
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,540
No need to feel bad.

442
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,980
Thank you all.

443
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,840
Young Master, eat more.

444
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,680
Eat now, Young Master.

445
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,680
- Eat up.
- Dandan, eat.

446
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,540
Eat up.

447
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,760
By the way, Young Master.

448
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,640
I found a part-time cooking job.

449
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
In the afternoons,

450
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,120
I'll buy groceries from the West Market.

451
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,020
So, I'll leave the household chores to Dandan.

452
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,560
Although I'm old,

453
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,130
I can't just stay home doing nothing.

454
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,700
You all go to work.

455
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,570
I'll handle

456
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,370
the household chores.

457
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,560
Come on. Let's eat.

458
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,570
Eat up.

459
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,750
Once we finish eating,

460
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,680
we'll go out

461
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,810
and look for work too.

462
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,020
(Delight and Peace)

463
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,270
Since it is getting colder,

464
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,430
I've prepared a cushion for you.

465
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,740
Be careful not to catch a cold.

466
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,110
That's thoughtful of you.

467
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,850
Ms. Shuangshuang,

468
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,650
may I help you put it on?

469
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,740
Thank you.

470
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,540
No problem.

471
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,220
Looks beautiful.

472
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,060
(Yuncui City)

473
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:24,660
(Wine Shop)

474
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,510
Really?

475
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,570
You saw a girl like that?

476
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,190
Should be right.

477
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,700
She bought groceries and went back to Liuxiang.

478
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,890
Ms. Shuangshuang.

479
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,570
Is it really you?

480
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,370
What do you want?

481
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,990
None of your business.

482
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,060
If you don't want to die, get lost.

483
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,260
You're here for Shuangshuang.

484
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,810
Jerk.

485
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,570
I'll teach you to mind your own business.

486
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,840
Take that!

487
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,890
Beat him up.

488
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,800
Isn't this the girl?

489
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,130
She walked right into us.

490
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,220
Get her!

491
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,310
Liu!

492
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
Liu!

493
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,370
Shuangshuang.

494
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,700
Here, have a zongzi.

495
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,850
Liu! Liu!

496
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,200
Liu!

497
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
Liu!

498
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,310
Let's go.

499
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,460
(Su Jue.)

500
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,980
How is he, doctor?

501
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,780
His life is saved,

502
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,840
but his legs are crippled.

503
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,890
What do you mean?

504
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,440
If you can't cure him, I'll kill you.

505
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,940
Young Master, let the doctor finish.

506
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,950
His bones are shattered.

507
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,560
With rehabilitation,

508
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,980
he might stand again.

509
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,470
But to walk like a normal person,

510
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,330
not even a legendary doctor could help.

511
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,700
Doctor, what can we do now?

512
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,980
Give him food that strengthens
bones and muscles.

513
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,610
Who did this to him?

514
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,680
Let's go.

515
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
I've never seen such fine jade.

516
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,980
No, too expensive.

517
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
What do you want?

518
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,600
Where's Su Jue?

519
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,570
He went with Shopkeeper Wang
to do business outside the city.

520
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,410
They haven't returned yet.

521
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,890
Let's go.

522
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,160
Let's go.

523
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,300
She'll smash the store.

524
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,880
Hurry and go.

525
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
Go. Go.

526
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,640
Pei.

527
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,460
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

528
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,220
- Don't kill my Pei.
- Pei?

529
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,550
Don't kill me.

530
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,960
Pei.

531
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,850
Pei.

532
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,130
Pei.

533
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,350
Pei.

534
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,940
(I, Pei Chufeng, lost my mind and collaborated
with the thief Shan Jingtian to steal...)

535
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,540
Pei. Pei.

536
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,310
Pei.

537
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,220
(Could he be Pei Chufeng?)

538
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
In a few days, you'll be fine.

539
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,680
If not, go to see the doctor.

540
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,070
I don't even know who she is.

541
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,120
She just kicked me out of nowhere.

542
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,840
- I'm innocent.
- Enough.

543
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,030
Did she mistake me for someone else?

544
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,870
What's wrong?

545
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,510
A masked person wants to see you.

546
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,070
You were not here, so she started a fight.

547
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,270
Didn't see her face clearly?

548
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,230
No. She's highly skilled in martial arts.

549
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,400
Her voice sounded like a woman.

550
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,370
A woman?

551
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,160
And she took an old man

552
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,890
with disheveled hair from the backyard.

553
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,760
Oh, no.

554
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Remember.

555
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,990
No one has ever been taken out of here.

556
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,120
Tell everyone.

557
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,310
If anyone talks,

558
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,750
they won't die a good death.

559
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,020
- Go quickly.
- Yes, yes.

560
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,200
Yes.

561
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
Let's go.

562
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,090
Uncle, what should we do?

563
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,730
Don't panic, Jue.

564
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,290
This person acted recklessly.

565
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,820
She probably stumbled in by accident.

566
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,460
Just remember.

567
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,380
We never had this secret chamber.

568
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,690
We'll see and plan accordingly.

569
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,430
Alright.

570
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,060
(Pei's Mansion)

571
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,560
Pei.

572
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,640
Pei.

573
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,830
Pei.

574
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,080
Pei.

575
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,820
Where is Pei?

576
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,870
Pei.

577
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,990
Pei.

578
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,310
Pei.

579
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,870
Pei.

580
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,940
Where is Pei?

581
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,820
Pei, Pei.

582
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,020
- Where is Pei?
- Are your wounds still hurting?

583
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,910
Pei.

584
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,990
It doesn't hurt anymore.

585
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,830
Pei.

586
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,390
Shuangshuang.

587
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,950
Pei.

588
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,520
Pei.

589
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,470
Pei.

590
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,630
My Pei. Pei.

591
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,540
Dad.

592
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,500
Dad.

593
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm Pei.

594
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,880
Look at me closely. I'm Pei.

595
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,720
No.

596
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,570
You're not Pei.

597
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,400
Where is Pei? Where is Pei?

598
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,340
You're not. Don't hit me.

599
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,030
- What's going on?
- Don't hit me.

600
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,630
I found him in a secret dungeon

601
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,650
- of the Su's place.
- Don't hit me.

602
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,570
If I'm not mistaken,

603
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,760
when you received the news

604
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,650
of his death in the fire,

605
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,190
he was already imprisoned

606
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,610
in the Su's dungeon.

607
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,500
Don't hit me.

608
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,610
Don't hit me.

609
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,720
Pei Pei.

610
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,730
Pei Pei.

611
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,830
Pei Pei.

612
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,250
You must stay calm.

613
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,290
Now is not the time to be rash.

614
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,500
I know you're hurting.

615
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,340
But the more it hurts,

616
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,290
the more you need to stay calm,

617
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,130
okay?

618
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,420
Don't hit me.

619
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,250
Don't, don't.

620
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,730
I'll draw.

621
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,380
I'll draw.

622
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,650
I'll draw.

623
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,990
I'll draw.
