No.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,360
This way. She'll come this way.

00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,900
What are you doing?

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,300
Dandan, have some tea.

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,580
Here.

29
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,660
No.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,420
Like this.

31
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,000
Turn around, and then...

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,460
Why are you grinning?

33
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm not marrying a fool.

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,760
You can't do that.

35
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,340
You promised me in front of everyone.

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,280
You can't back out now.

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,520
Once we're less busy,

38
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,020
we'll pick a good day.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,520
I'll marry you openly.

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,160
Still grinning?

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm not marrying you.

42
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,840
Okay, no more grinning.

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,880
Actually, I have something to ask you.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,280
I feel like your sister thinks too much.

45
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,620
We're not even married yet,

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,400
and you're already judging my family.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,500
If you judge my sister again,

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,720
I'll really get mad.

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,680
I won't say it anymore.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,620
We owe this victory

51
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,760
to Ms. Shan's wisdom.

52
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,680
Let me take a closer look.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,180
Alright. No more fooling around.

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,440
I have serious business to discuss.

55
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,700
What business?

56
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,620
After all we've been through,

57
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,580
we've finally

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,280
regained control.

59
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,440
Are we just going to do business as usual?

60
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,400
You mean...

61
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,040
Do you remember what you said?

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,160
We won't harm innocent people,

63
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,960
but tit for tat is fair play.

64
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,600
So, you mean...

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
We don't need

66
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,840
to show mercy to that troublemaker.

67
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,160
And now,

68
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,960
we're better than him.

69
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,900
We also have plenty of good materials.

70
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,300
It's time to teach them a lesson.

71
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,140
Exactly.

72
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,840
Have another cup of tea.

73
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,940
Here.

74
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,300
This way.

75

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,380
Look at this.

78
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,880
This necklace.

79
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,580
Young Master.

80
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,840
Why are you here?

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,760
Just checking on you.

82
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,900
Everyone's been working hard.

83
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,420
I brought some late-night snacks.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,780
They're on the stone table outside.

85
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,620
Go to eat.

86
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you, Ms. Shan.

87
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,540
Let's go. So happy.

88
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,080
Yes. Let's go.

89
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,220
How is it?

90
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,060
Delicious.

91
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,760
- Here.
- I'll do it myself.

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,260
Sit down.

93
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,720
You've worked hard.

94
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,400
You too.

95
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,960
You've worked the hardest.

96
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,080
Drink the soup.

97
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,420
All the customers are going to the main store.

98
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,660
This can't go on.

99
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
We need to find a way

100
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,620
to boost the other nine stores' reputation.

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,460
I've thought about it

102
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,760
but never executed it.

103
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,400
It's a shame to waste such good locations.

104
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,100
So, Shopkeeper Hao,

105
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,660
please come up with a plan in days.

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,640
Okay, I'll handle it.

107
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,900
Thank you.

108
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,960
It's my duty.

109
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,880
One hundred fifty-eight.

110
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,760
One hundred fifty.

111
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,580
Have a seat.

112
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,900
What do you need me for?

113
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
Look.

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,320
This is

115
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,560
my latest invention, chain carving.

116
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,160
It evolves from round carving techniques.

117
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,420
The jade quality and carving skills

118
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,520
needs to be very high.

119
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,740
You need to polish it first
and then remove the loops.

120
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,760
It's very complicated.

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,640
Careful. Don't touch it.

122
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,160
Sorry.

123
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,160
This jade is so expensive.

124
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,620
It's fragile whether held

125
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,000
or worn.

126
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,400
But this necklace isn't for wearing.

127
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,520
Then what for?

128
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,520
Display at home.

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,880
Display at home? A chain?

130
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,760
I don't understand the rich lifestyle.

131
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,320
Young Master, I delivered them all.

132
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,940
Here.

133
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,300
The last one. To the City Lord's Mansion.

134
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,340
Be extra careful.

135
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,760
Sure. Leave it to me.

136
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,560
Be careful.

137
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,880
You should rest a bit.

138
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,080
Don't mess around.

139
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,320
Now, can someone explain to me

140
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,420
why our sales have been

141
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,600
so poor lately?

142
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,660
Why?

143
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,380
For some time now,

144
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,760
the regular big customers

145
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,760
haven't come.

146
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,520
Walk-ins just browse

147
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,160
and leave.

148
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,300
Come on.

149
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,260
Normally,

150
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,760
even if Qipei Pavilion is revived,

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,900
with Suyu Pavilion's reputation,

152
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,400
it shouldn't be this bad.

153
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm going out.

154
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,640
You...

155
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,920
Pick them up.

156
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,300
(Flower Pavilion)

157
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,600
This beaded coral phoenix hairpin.

158
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,020
Look at the exquisite craftsmanship.

159
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,000
The jade is so translucent.

160
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,260
Qipei Pavilion's debut.

161
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,180
I'm the exclusive agent.

162
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,940
Mention my name

163
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,420
at Qipei Pavilion,

164
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,280
and you'll get the best discount.

165
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,540
Check this out.

166
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,920
Smooth. Feels nice.

167
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,660
Hello, you two.

168
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,760
Enjoy your chat.

169
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,240
Mr. Su, you're here too.

170
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,000
Cui, serve tea to Mr. Su.

171
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,520
Look at this craftsmanship.

172
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,400
Amazing.

173
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,820
Openwork carving of dragon and phoenix.

174
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,600
Every cut is masterful.

175
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,060
In Yuncui City,

176
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,880
only Pei Pei can do this.

177
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,760
Remarkable.

178
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,760
Qipei Pavilion was laying low,

179
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,380
but now they're back with a bang.

180
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,660
Indeed.

181
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,780
We thought Qipei Pavilion

182
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,930
was done with jade.

183
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,820
But now

184
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,500
they handle both gold and jade.

185
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,040
Quite impressive.

186
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,520
How did you get this masterpiece?

187
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,260
Mr. Pei sent it

188
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,280
to my house,

189
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,580
saying this good stuff is very rare

190
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,980
and it's time to get rid of inferior products.

191
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,920
Inferior? That's Suyu Pavilion.

192
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,500
You...

193
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,640
Mr. Su, Mr. Su.

194
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,060
It's just a joke. Don't take it seriously.

195
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,020
A joke?

196
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,820
When you begged me for stock back then,

197
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,180
why didn't you joke like this?

198
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,300
Beg?

199
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,420
You're the seller.

200
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,600
We're the buyers.

201
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,300
Who's begging whom?

202
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,830
Suyu Pavilion, a century-old brand,

203
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,680
never begs.

204
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,580
Pah!

205
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,400
A century-old brand?

206
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,140
I bet you didn't meet Pei Pei a century ago,

207
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,160
or you wouldn't have lasted a century.

208
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,500
- No, no.
- Say that again?

209
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,540
I can say it again.

210
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,000
I can say it ten times.

211
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,520
Look at this.

212
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,020
The craftsmanship, the quality.

213
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,160
It's just better than yours.

214
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,700
If it weren't for Mr. Pei's generosity,

215
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,100
giving us some samples,

216
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,460
We'd still be buying

217
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,090
- inferior goods from you.
- What are you saying?

218
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,540
Now we know the value of quality over quantity.

219
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,140
We'd rather wait in line for good stuff

220
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,820
than patronize your century-old brand.

221
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,860
Who do you think you are?

222
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,900
Are you going to hit me?

223
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,580
Calm down. We're still friends.

224
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,700
We'll talk another day.

225
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,020
- Let's go.
- Their goods are indeed inferior.

226
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,300
- Hurry, hurry.
- Acting so high and mighty.

227
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,780
- Let's go.
- Forget it.

228
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,140
Refund.

229
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,220
Everyone.

230
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Calm down.

231
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,580
Don't worry. Listen to me.

232
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,420
Refund. Refund.

233
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,660
Calm down, everyone.

234
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,780
Everyone, everyone.

235
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,340
Quiet down.

236
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Shopkeeper Wang.

237
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,660
You have to repay your debt.

238
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
How long do you plan to stall?

239
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,060
Mr. Wang,

240
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,220
we agreed.

241
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,620
Once the goods are sold,

242
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,180
we'll settle the remaining balance.

243
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,820
- You...
- Everyone.

244
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,460
Our policy

245
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,820
is no refunds.

246
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,860
If you don't like it,

247
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,660
you can change it for other styles.

248
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,500
What other styles?

249
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,550
All old stock.

250
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,580
Qipei Pavilion's giveaways

251
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,180
are better than yours.

252
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,620
- Right? Everyone?
- Yes, yes.

253
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,980
- Yes.
- We have money.

254
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,180
We'd rather save it for something good.

255
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,100
Right, everyone?

256
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,580
- Yes.
- Refund.

257
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,860
- Hurry.
- Refund.

258
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,220
Can your goods

259
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,100
even sell?

260
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,420
When you bought all our jade stones,

261
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,100
you only paid 50 percent.

262
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,950
Hurry up.

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,620
Settle your debt with us.

264
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,300
- Refund.
- Pay us.

265
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,660
Uncle,

266
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,180
refund their money.

267
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,180
Refund and pay as they requested.

268
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,780
That's more like it.

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,220
Refund.

270
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,940
- Really?
- Refund. Hurry.

271
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,220
The boss said it. Refund our money.

272
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Hurry and refund our money.

273
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
The boss said it. Hurry.

274
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,140
Refund their money.

275
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,140
Everyone, don't panic. Line up.

276
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,980
One by one.

277
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,860
We've waited this long.

278
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
Everyone, hurry.

279
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,580
Now all the stock is unsold.

280
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,940
The warehouse is full of materials.

281
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,780
We've run out of funds.

282
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,340
If this continues,

283
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,300
Suyu Pavilion will collapse.

284
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
Uncle,

285
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,540
I don't want to hear this now.

286
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,060
There are

287
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,260
only two ways.

288
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,580
Either create new designs

289
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,780
that surpass the Pei family

290
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,900
or negotiate with them.

291
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,940
Understood.

292
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,260
Well, you...

293
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,780
Here.

294
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,020
Are you hungry?

295
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,780
I'm not.

296
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,540
Not hungry?

297
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,540
Suddenly, I'm a bit hungry.

298
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,900
Thank you.

299
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,220
You've worked hard, my shopkeeper.

300
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,180
You've worked hard too, my jade carver.

301
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Lately,

302
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,980
you've been carving day and night.

303
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,820
You must be exhausted.

304
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,820
I'm not tired at all.

305
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,180
It's very fulfilling.

306
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,580
There's nothing in this world

307
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,380
that makes me happier than jade carving.

308
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,180
What about me?

309
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,420
You?

310
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,060
You're tied for first.

311
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,540
Just tied?

312
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,020
So cheesy.

313
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
Madam.

314
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,140
Mother.

315
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,580
Please sit.

316
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,540
Still chatting about jade?

317
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,340
In my opinion,

318
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,180
your engagement

319
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,580
should be the priority.

320
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,700
Madam,

321
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,060
where did you and Mr. Hao go this morning?

322
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,900
I took Madam to see a show.

323
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,780
It's good for her health.

324
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,220
Was this your idea?

325
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,700
All the city's nobles

326
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,980
are asking Suyu Pavilion for a refund.

327
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,620
They haven't made a sale

328
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,900
in ages.

329
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,060
We don't need

330
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,780
to show mercy to that troublemaker.

331
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,340
And now,

332
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,780
we're better than him.

333
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,700
We also have plenty of good materials.

334
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,900
It's time to teach them a lesson.

335
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,180
So, do what you truly love.

336
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,820
Turn ordinary jade

337
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,100
into masterpieces.

338
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,700
Show them what real jade carving is.

339
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,340
I've calculated.

340
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,980
The jade collectors

341
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,900
in the city are a few.

342
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,820
Let's add a few resellers.

343
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,620
Once you finish the pieces,

344
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,660
I'll deliver them personally.

345
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,620
After seeing your work,

346
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,020
whether they'll go to Suyu Pavilion again

347
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,700
won't be my concern.

348
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,540
You're full of ideas.

349
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,300
They bought up all the jade stones,

350
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,420
leaving none for us.

351
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,580
Let them keep those stones for New Year.

352
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,820
Carve well.

353
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,980
If they still prefer Suyu Pavilion

354
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,260
after seeing your work,

355
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,860
we'd lose everything.

356
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,940
Don't worry.

357
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,020
Even in Su Jue's dreams,

358
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,340
that

359
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,540
won't happen.

360
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,940
Exactly.

361
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,980
The problem is

362
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,300
that they bought out

363
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,820
all the jade stones nationwide,

364
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,580
hoping for endless customers.

365
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,900
But now,

366
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,900
they can't even pay the interest.

367
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,300
Suyu Pavilion.

368
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,020
I wonder how long it can last.

369
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,860
They're doomed by their own actions.

370
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,700
That'll serve them right.

371
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,980
Young Master is right.

372
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,260
When they go bankrupt,

373
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,780
that's when we celebrate.

374
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Look at you.

375
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,700
Vulgar!

376
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,060
Vulgar!

377
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,140
Your wooden hairpin seems old.

378
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,540
Yes, Mr. Su.

379
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,860
May I have it?

380
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,300
Not for free.

381
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,100
I'll exchange it with you.

382
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,420
Mr. Su, this is too precious.

383
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,740
I can't accept it.

384
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,820
You deserve the best in the world.

385
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,900
Here.

386
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,540
Looks good.

387
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,300
(How can I be so unambitious?)

388
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,980
(Suyu Pavilion is in such a state,)

389
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,060
(but all I can think of is you.)

390
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,660
(Pei's Mansion)

391
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,060
Mr. Su, you called for me?

392
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,140
Just wanted to see you.

393
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,220
How have you been?

394
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,260
I've been well.

395
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,300
(Pei's Mansion)

396
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,140
Right.

397
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Why wouldn't you be?

398
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,820
How about you?

399
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm not well.

400
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,340
Not well at all.

401
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,780
Suyu Pavilion is severely overstocked.

402
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,780
Our business might not survive.

403
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,020
The worst part is

404
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,100
the one I love is with my enemy.

405
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,340
Mr. Su,

406
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,100
if there's nothing else,

407
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,860
- I'll take my leave.
- Shuangshuang.

408
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,020
You always told me

409
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,100
you didn't care about superficial splendor.

410
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,100
I didn't understand then,

411
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,180
but now I do.

412
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,980
All these years, I was wrong.

413
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,900
I was impatient, chasing fame and fortune,

414
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
and ended up

415
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
with nothing.

416
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,620
Now that I have nothing,

417
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,300
I realize that in this world,

418
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,780
I can give up everything,

419
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,820
except for you.

420
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,460
Shuangshuang,

421
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,580
please come back, okay?

422
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,420
Mr. Su,

423
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,820
I believe

424
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,620
I've made myself clear before.

425
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,380
Please have some manners

426
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,140
and stop bothering me.

427
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,540
Shuangshuang,

428
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,420
I was wrong before.

429
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,020
I thought my wealth

430
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,620
would win your heart.

431
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,260
I shouldn't have thought that way.

432
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,300
But now I can't hold on any longer.

433
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,900
I need you.

434
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,100
When you were wealthy,

435
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
I never cared.

436
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,380
Now,

437
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,420
what can I get from you?

438
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,940
You're not like this.

439
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,860
Why?

440
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,100
Why are you treating me this way?

441
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,300
What do I have to say?

442
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,340
What do I have to do

443
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,540
to satisfy you?

444
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,780
- Tell me!
- Let go of Shuangshuang.

445
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,620
Tell me.

446
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,460
What do you want to do?

447
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,860
Who do you think you are

448
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,940
to push my young master?

449
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,420
He's my fiancé.

450
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
Shan Shuangshuang.

451
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,340
You just want to refuse me.

452
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,380
Don't joke about this.

453
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,460
When did I ever joke with you?

454
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,020
Why are you here?

455
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,900
You won.

456
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,180
Completely won.

457
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,700
I never intended to compete with you.

458
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,580
Shuangshuang,

459
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,340
I shouldn't have thought that way.

460
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,260
I was wrong.

461
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,140
But now I can't hold on any longer.

462
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,620
I need you.

463
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,900
Let's not bother her.

464
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,220
Shuangshuang.

465
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
I'm fine.

466
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,460
It's good to make things clear.

467
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,820
Sorry.

468
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,820
I just blurted out

469
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,340
to deal with him.

470
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
I understand.

471
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,060
Su Jue is

472
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,220
arrogant, proud, and condescending,

473
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,820
yet he came to make peace.

474
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,900
It seems Suyu Pavilion

475
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
is truly at a dead end.

476
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,100
The heavens know what he's done.

477
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,820
What goes around comes around.

478
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,060
(Suyu Pavilion)

479
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,860
Since you first entered Suyu Pavilion,

480
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,020
you caught my attention.

481
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,340
I've made up my mind.

482
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,780
I want to spend my life

483
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
with you.

484
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Mr. Su,

485
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,900
I think you misunderstand.

486
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,860
I never had feelings for you.

487
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,340
Shuangshuang.

488
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,340
But now I can't hold on any longer.

489
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
I need you.

490
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,780
When you were wealthy,

491
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,340
I never cared.

492
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,140
Now,

493
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
what can I get from you?

494
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,060
Jue.

495
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,140
Take down that plaque.

496
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,820
(Fine Gold and Good Jade)

497
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,660
Well.

498
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,020
What are you thinking?

499
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,940
Calm down.

500
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,380
I don't deserve those words.

501
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,420
Why are you so discouraged?

502
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,380
There's always a way.

503
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,620
What way?

504
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,900
A dead end?

505
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
I can't compete with Pei Pei.

506
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,060
Suyu Pavilion's business is failing.

507
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,820
Why bother struggling?

508
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Jue,

509
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,140
since your parents passed,

510
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,500
I've done everything to help you,

511
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,780
even resorting to unsavory means,

512
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,580
just to secure your position in Yuncui City.

513
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,780
And you want to give up now?

514
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,660
I feel worthless.

515
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,100
I told you before.

516
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,300
To continue the business,

517
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,860
you need to surpass him in skill,

518
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,140
or negotiate.

519
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,140
Perhaps I was too soft.

520
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,580
If you want to win

521
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,220
and pull yourself together

522
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,380
to save

523
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,100
the Su family's business,

524
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,540
I will find a way.

525
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,460
(Delight and Peace)

526
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,220
Young Master.

527
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,300
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

528
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,860
Suddenly, I think Su Jue is quite pitiful.

529
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,380
Are you feeling sorry for him?

530
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,380
Those who are pitiful
must have done something hateful.

531
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,690
Think

532
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,860
about all he's done.

533
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,260
Young Master.

534
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,380
That's true.

535
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,780
But his deep affection for my sister

536
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,860
doesn't seem fake.

537
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,580
Don't worry too much.

538
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,620
Everyone has their destiny.

539
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,340
Heaven has eyes

540
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,620
and will arrange things accordingly.

541
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,180
- Good day, Madam.
- Apply even pressure.

542
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,140
Ms. Li,

543
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,460
what is this?

544
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,780
It's soup for Young Master and Ms. Dandan.

545
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,420
What kind of soup?

546
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,620
It's Ophiopogon with lotus root.

547
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Pei has a weak stomach.

548
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,340
Dandan is also frail and feels cold easily.

549
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,660
Ophiopogon is cold by nature.

550
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,860
Drinking it would harm their vitality.

551
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,700
Bring it to my room.

552
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,670
- Yes.
- Madam.

553
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,620
- I'll do it.
- Ms. Li.

554
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,140
Prepare some deer antler soup for them.

555
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,380
Yes.

556
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,180
Thank you.

557
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,420
Madam, it's my duty.

558
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
Let's go.

559
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,420
What?

560
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,860
Leave.

561
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,460
How did this happen?

562
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,140
How?

563
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,860
It's impossible.

564
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,620
Uncle,

565
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,660
what have you done?

566
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,060
You don't need to know.

567
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,060
Just remember.

568
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,620
Whatever happens next,

569
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,540
it's all my doing.

570
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,580
It has nothing to do with you.

571
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
It shouldn't be.

572
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,420
It shouldn't be like this.

573
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,820
How did this happen?

574
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,380
She's fine in the morning.

575
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,540
It's only been half a day.

576
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Madam.

577
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,820
Madam.

578
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,780
Madam.

579
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,380
How can this be?

580
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,860
My mother has always been so healthy.

581
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,380
How can she just be gone?

582
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,220
Why?

583
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,020
Young Master.

584
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,420
It has come to this.

585
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,620
I can no longer

586
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,020
hide the truth from you.

587
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,780
Madam has been severely ill for some time.

588
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,140
She didn't want to worry you,

589
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,860
so she kept it a secret.

590
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,820
These past days,

591
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,580
Madam was most concerned about you,

592
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,780
afraid that after she was gone,

593
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,700
you would struggle to uphold the family legacy
and end up destitute.

594
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,860
That's why she became

595
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,580
strict and cautious with you.

596
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,820
She also arranged for Ms. Dandan

597
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,620
to stay by your side,

598
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,900
hoping she would motivate you to be diligent

599
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,940
and revive your spirit.

600
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,380
Young Master.

601
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
Guixiang.

602
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm here. I'm here.

603
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,140
I...

604
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,100
I didn't expect

605
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,380
Madam to appear suddenly.

606
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,660
I poison her.

607
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,580
I've known Madam for many years,

608
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,300
and this has shaken me.

609
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,780
I'm truly afraid.

610
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,860
Wang Jiu, I...

611
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,420
Don't be afraid.

612
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,700
It's good that the old fox is dead.

613
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,740
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

614
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,860
It has come to this.

615
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,940
We have no choice

616
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,900
but to think of a way

617
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
to get rid of Pei Pei and Shan Dandan.

618
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,140
No.

619
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,620
No.

620
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,540
No, Wang Jiu.

621
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,620
This is too sudden.

622
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,460
Shan Dandan is very astute.

623
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,860
I'm afraid she'll suspect me eventually.

624
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,460
Let's leave now.

625
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,660
Both of us.

626
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,900
Let's retire to our hometown,

627
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,100
find a peaceful place and enjoy our lives.

628
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,390
No more troubles.

629
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,300
Is that okay?

630
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,420
Alright, alright.

631
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,940
Guixiang, don't be afraid.

632
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,100
I'm here.

633
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,300
But think about it.

634
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,140
If we left

635
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,460
right after the old fox died,

636
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,460
we would surely be suspected.

637
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,780
Let's stay calm.

638
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,380
You stay a little longer

639
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,100
to keep an eye on them.

640
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,340
We will have plenty of time to enjoy later.

641
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,860
Wang Jiu,

642
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,780
since we met,

643
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,060
you've always told me

644
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,620
you'd take me away for a better life.

645
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
Now,

646
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,460
I've been working for you for over ten years.

647
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,700
You promised...

648
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,340
Guixiang, I remember everything.

649
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,380
I know these years

650
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,940
have been hard on you.

651
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,460
But I swear

652
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,820
the tough days are almost over.

653
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,140
You...

654
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,020
Just give me a little more time, okay?

655
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,860
(Spirita Tablet of the Late Lady Qin
of the Pei Family)

656
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,740
Ms. Li.

657
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,100
These are the medicinal herbs I've got.

658
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,460
Best for nourishing vitality and blood.

659
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,100
Here.

660
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,100
Madam.

661
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,300
Isn't this for the young master?

662
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,080
Take it.

663
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,220
Madam, I can't accept that.

664
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,300
It's better to give it to Mr. Pei.

665
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,140
We are all family.

666
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,620
What's the difference? Here.

667
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,060
Take it.

668
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,660
Hold it steady.

669
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,620
Thank you.

670
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,100
Girl,

671
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,820
you are very beautiful.

672
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,660
You and your sister are different,

673
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,020
but both are very likable.

674
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,540
Unfortunately,

675
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,100
I only have one son.

676
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,300
If I had another,

677
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,180
I would surely make you

678
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,580
my daughter-in-law.

679
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,140
I independently made an earpiece.

680
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,740
I showed it to Madam,

681
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,260
and she has been praising me,

682
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
saying I'm smart.

683
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,620
Shuangshuang, don't worry.

684
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,300
I have Madam covering me.

685
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,260
The madam trusts me.

686
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,700
I can't let her down.

687
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,660
Ms. Shuangshuang.

688
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,220
Tell me.

689
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,420
How did you and Ms. Li conspire

690
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,620
to poison Madam Pei?
