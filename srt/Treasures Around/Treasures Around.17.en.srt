Go for it, sir.

Go for it, sir.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,220
Go for it, sir.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,140
Bend your back. Keep your knees tight.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
Lean forward.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,350
Keep your gaze straight ahead.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,630
Relax your chest. Tighten your stomach.

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,850
Drop your shoulders.

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,660
Use 30% of your strength.

32
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,290
Three.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Two.

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,290
One.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
Go!

36
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,980
Sorry about that.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,540
No worries. Try one more.

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,700
(So rich, yet so dumb.)

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,220
(With the IQ of a child.)

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,190
(Strutting around proudly,)

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,150
(he wants to compete over this.)

42
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,880
These three are just warm-ups.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,590
After the warm-up, the competition will begin.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
Come on.

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,810
Go for it.

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,810
It's over. Let's start the competition.

47
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,310
Three shots each. Let's take turns.

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,540
Miss, you go first.

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,100
Keep your gaze straight ahead.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,700
Stop showing off. I'll scold you later.

51
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,170
Give it to me.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,700
Shuangshuang, you can do it?

53
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,170
Go for it.

54
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,090
Miss, after you.

55
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,580
- Go for it, sir.
- Go for it, sir.

56
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
Amazing!

57
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,970
- Lost.
- The young master lost.

58
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,230
We can have jewelry now.

59
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,340
Shuangshuang, you're incredible!

60
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,310
You can't win like this.

61
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,570
Whoever shoots more wins.

62
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,140
No rule against getting help.

63
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,130
Sir, you'll take

64
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,750
all our jewelry.

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,500
Ladies, let's go.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,230
Let's go.

67
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,310
Young Master, I'm going too.

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Bye.

69
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,020
Sir, please settle the bill.

70
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,420
(Zhang's Fabric Shop)

71
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,290
Mr. Su,

72
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,580
long time no see.

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,430
Mr. Si, it's been a while.

74
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,820
I heard all the jade

75
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,110
in Yuncui City

76
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,900
is in your hands now.

77
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,260
Thanks to your help.

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,230
Qipei Pavilion

79
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,670
must be in trouble now.

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,550
I heard they've started selling jewelry.

81
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,140
A century-old business
is on the brink of collapse.

82
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,820
So, have you

83
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,550
made up your mind?

84
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,580
You're here for this, aren't you?

85
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,460
Though it's been long since we met,

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,380
it's like old times.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,070
Being friends with you, Mr. Su,

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,550
is a great honor.

89
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
Likewise.

90
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,110
Rest assured.

91
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,700
Everything is arranged.

92
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,340
For the mines,

93
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,700
just visit as planned.

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,550
But there's something I don't understand.

95
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Please go ahead.

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,430
For years, the Si family's

97
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,480
Moshan Jade

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,020
has the best quality.

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,770
(Si Ruchu from Modu)
Master Si only dealt in Moshan Jade.

100
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,900
It's a family tradition.

101
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,900
He's never allowed the family
to deal with other mines.

102
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,430
Now,

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,970
you want

104
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,380
to gather all types of jade.

105
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,990
If Master Si knew...

106
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,990
You bought up jade

107
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,340
to crush the Pei family.

108
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,750
If Master Su was still alive and knew about it,

109
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,990
what would you do?

110
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,190
I'd persist.

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,530
But there are

112
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,140
too many obstacles.

113
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,770
A smooth life,

114
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,550
now full of hindrances.

115
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,380
You're right, Mr. Su.

116
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,700
But they're just pests.

117
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,990
If you don't like them,

118
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,070
just remove them.

119
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,790
Young Master! Young Master!

120
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,170
Young Master!

121
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,100
Thank you, sir.

122
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,070
The Si family's eldest son is in town.

123
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,170
- What?
- Who?

124
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,980
Master Si's eldest son, Mr. Si.

125
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,880
Our benefactor.

126
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,820
Our true patron is here.

127
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
If the Si family breaks tradition to help,

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,210
our jade business

129
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,510
can thrive again.

130
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,270
(Seems the Pei family hasn't given up on jade.)

131
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,170
(They're in real trouble.)

132
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,010
Let's go.

133
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,360
I...

134
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,510
I'm also a Si.

135
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,580
(But why is my brother here suddenly?)

136
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,030
(Never mind. I'll go and see.)

137
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,930
Dandan,

138
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,360
leaving him like that

139
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,640
isn't good.

140
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
But we need to solve

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,190
the raw stone problem.

142
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,550
I'll apologize to him later.

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Here.

144
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,700
Slow down. Wait for me.

145
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,190
(Fengyue Teahouse)
Keep up. We'll go ahead.

146
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,240
Careful, Shuangshuang.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,090
People of status

148
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,790
stay in private rooms.

149
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,360
Come.

150
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,170
Slow down.

151
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,250
Si...

152
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,340
What brings Mr. Pei here?

153
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,150
Since you're here, enjoy and eat.

154
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,670
Let's eat. Come on.

155
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,770
This...

156
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,450
Mr. Si has come to Yuncui City,

157
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,090
so we came to greet him.

158
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,390
- Shuangshuang, sit.
- No need to greet.

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,270
I've arranged this inn

160
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,210
for Ruchu to stay.

161
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,190
You don't need to do anything.

162
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,860
None of your business.

163
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,550
Why are you here?

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,220
Can't I eat?

165
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,940
Eat elsewhere.

166
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
Ruyu,

167
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,620
why are you here?

168
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,410
Brother.

169
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,450
Brother?

170
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,390
Brother?

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,620
Brother?

172
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,560
I...

173
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,390
Let me introduce you.

174
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,270
This is my younger brother, Ruyu.

175
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,290
Since Ruyu is in Yuncui City,

176
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,410
why not stay here?

177
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,510
So you can look after each other.

178
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,650
No need.

179
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,690
We invited Mr. Ruyu and his family

180
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,330
to stay with us for a while.

181
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,270
And Mr. Ruyu agreed, right?

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,570
Yes.

183
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,760
Many beauties

184
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,220
are waiting for me.

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,170
Right.

186
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,170
We've arranged for those ladies

187
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,030
to take good care of you.

188
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,910
Don't worry, Mr. Si.

189
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,130
Yes.

190
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,030
Mr. Ruyu's presence graces our humble abode.

191
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,170
Mr. Ruchu, if you have time,

192
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,910
join us for a drink.

193
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,460
Qipei Pavilion is truly a humble abode now.

194
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,570
Mr. Su is here

195
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,450
for talent and cooperation.

196
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,480
You don't even deal in jade now.

197
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,290
The Si family are jade lovers.

198
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,220
You don't need to go through such trouble.

199
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,410
I heard that the Su family

200
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,190
recently bought a large quantity of jade.

201
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,410
But the craftsmanship of your jade carvings

202
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,190
is far inferior to ours.

203
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,100
Everyone is watching and waiting.

204
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,410
Maybe you should think

205
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,150
about clearing your own stock first.

206
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,860
Ms. Shan, don't worry about our inventory.

207
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,270
Our reputation still stands,

208
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,600
so we have confidence.

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,760
The Si brothers are new to Yuncui.

210
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
You must be curious.

211
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
Feel free to explore.

212
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,980
When you're done,

213
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,940
I'll host a grand banquet

214
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,720
to see you off.

215
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,910
We can drink and celebrate.

216
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,310
Let's set the banquet for seven days from now.

217
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,460
Thanks, Mr. Su.

218
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,530
My pleasure.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Ruyu,

220
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,510
you've always been idle.

221
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,790
Staying at someone else's house,

222
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,790
don't be too lazy.

223
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,070
If it's inconvenient,

224
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,510
move out early.

225
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,720
Got it?

226
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,430
Mr. Ruchu, you worry too much.

227
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,720
Thanks to Mr. Su,

228
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,810
our household is full of idle people.

229
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,980
Mr. Ruyu will be very comfortable.

230
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,150
That's good.

231
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
Come on.

232
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,000
Don't be disheartened.

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,450
There's not just Si Ruchu

234
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,860
but also Si Ruyu.

235
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,670
I'm not disheartened.

236
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,670
Just worried.

237
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,150
With both Si brothers in the city,

238
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,690
it'll be turbulent.

239
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,330
No matter the storm, if we unite,

240
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,460
we won't fall.

241
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,390
Dandan is right.

242
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,100
Mr. Si, wait.

243
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,860
It's you again.

244
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,360
You took my money

245
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,970
and I was polite earlier.

246
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,100
What more do you want?

247
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,940
We'll return

248
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,790
half the money.

249
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,450
You're a money-grubber.

250
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,970
Loving money is human nature.

251
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,930
Mr. Si,

252
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,980
we didn't recognize your status earlier.

253
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,390
We apologize.

254
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,690
Please continue staying

255
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,360
at our house with the ladies.

256
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,570
We'll entertain you properly.

257
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,840
Yes, please don't hold a grudge.

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,570
Let bygones be bygones.

259
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,430
Forget about it.

260
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,030
Is that up to you?

261
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,070
You left without a care.

262
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,190
I was hurt.

263
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,510
What do you want?

264
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,270
We have no money left.

265
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,250
Take it.

266
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,460
You're a mercenary.

267
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,970
Sir,

268
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm a mercenary but not a villain.

269
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,690
You've been in the world long enough to know

270
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,360
everyone gets hurt sometimes.

271
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Friends come afar.

272
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,640
Guests are our parents.

273
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
What nonsense.

274
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,760
How can I be your parent?

275
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,190
Who wants to be your parent? Besides, I...

276
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,930
My sister means

277
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,720
we were wrong earlier.

278
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,910
We apologize.

279
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,050
Apologize.

280
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,190
Though we aren't in the jade business now,

281
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,580
our residence is spacious.

282
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,310
It's more comfortable

283
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,100
than an inn.

284
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,410
Yes.

285
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,340
We have many people. It's lively.

286
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,130
Lead the way.

287
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,170
Alright, alright.

288
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,700
So impolite.

289
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,520
It's come to this.

290
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,090
No need for pretense.

291
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,760
I heard clearly.

292
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,210
The Su family monopolized jade.

293
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,090
You had to switch to gold and silver.

294
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,100
That's a last resort.

295
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,410
You want to return

296
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,290
to the jade business.

297
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm the key

298
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,030
to helping you return.

299
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,600
Am I right?

300
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,970
(First time seeing someone
more confident than me.)

301
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,270
(So shameless.)

302
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,710
Sir, you're absolutely right.

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,610
Would you help us and be the key

304
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,170
to unlock the door?

305
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,890
Helping you isn't impossible.

306
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,850
But I need to know

307
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,410
why I should help you.

308
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,930
Show me something.

309
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,790
Of course.

310
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,550
I know the Si family's reputation.

311
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,320
You only deal with Moshan Jade

312
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,900
and only supply jade connoisseurs.

313
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
My family is famous

314
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,380
for jade.

315
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,820
We should show our skills.

316
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,100
Seeing is believing.

317
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,550
Master Pei's craftsmanship is renowned.

318
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,660
Mr. Pei, I didn't expect you

319
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,550
to have such skills.

320
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,800
(A spoiled noble like you)

321
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,270
(at least has good taste.)

322
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,030
Such skill, yet in such a state.

323
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,470
What a pity.

324
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,050
Indeed.

325
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,270
My family has the largest mines.

326
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,320
Helping you isn't impossible.

327
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,690
But there are rules.

328
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,420
Mine owners can't supply directly
to jade shops.

329
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,900
Production is recorded annually.

330
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,030
Should I help

331
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,230
or not?

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,840
I'll think about it.

333
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,400
Sir...

334
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,790
What should we do?

335
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,140
Ladies, you've had a hard journey.

336
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,240
The scenery here is nice, right?

337
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,280
What a large courtyard.

338
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,170
It's quite nice.

339
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,690
- Yes.
- Good.

340
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,950
This is our villa.

341
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,050
Quiet and elegant.

342
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,030
Only maids serve here.

343
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,210
No outsiders.

344
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,340
You can rest easy.

345
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,210
By the way.

346
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,720
Ladies, it's been a while.

347
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,080
I haven't asked your names yet.

348
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,320
- Yingying.
- Yanyan.

349
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,860
- Hua.
- Cao.

350
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,990
Your names mean birds, flowers, and grass.

351
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,000
Your young master

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,100
uses such simple names.

353
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,380
Does he have many beauties?

354
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,450
Thousands in his harem?

355
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,890
You misunderstand him.

356
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,410
Yes, it's not like that.

357
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,320
Then what is it?

358
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
My parents died.

359
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,210
I went to live with relatives

360
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,520
but was driven out.

361
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,560
I had nowhere to go and met the young master.

362
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,900
He gave me a place.

363
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,210
My father remarried

364
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,410
and had a brother.

365
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,720
I ran away.

366
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,140
The young master saved me.

367
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,760
I was taken by a villain.

368
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,000
I was about to die,
but the young master saved me

369
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
and kept me by his side.

370
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,850
I was sold to a brothel by my family.

371
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,280
I refused to comply

372
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,690
and was nearly beaten to death.

373
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,470
The young master saved me.

374
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,040
We all genuinely appreciate him.

375
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,930
We truly want to stay by his side.

376
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,770
Yes.

377
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,420
According to you all,

378
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,710
have I

379
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,560
misunderstood your young master?

380
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,510
Yes.

381
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,240
He's actually a great person?

382
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,510
Our young master has had a tragic life.

384
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,270
We're all just pitiful souls
sharing the same fate.

385
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,890
For many years,

386
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,620
he has been all alone.

387
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,070
He?

388
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,510
The son of a mine owner

389
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,930
has had a tragic life?

390
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,080
Exactly.

391
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,310
Our young master actually...

392
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,080
Ladies, you'll live here.

393
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,280
If you need anything,

394
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,030
just find Hongyu.

395
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,900
Thank you both.

396
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,310
Ladies, this way, please.

397
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,460
(Peace and Tranquility)

398
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,100
What are you thinking about?

399
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,580
Do you think Si Ruyu will help us?

400
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,510
If not, I'll beg him.

401
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,620
If that doesn't work,

402
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,760
I'll kidnap him.

403
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,600
You...

404
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,070
Don't be hasty.

405
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,070
Si Ruyu

406
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,420
isn't as simple as he seems.

407
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,750
We don't know what he wants yet.

408
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,790
We can only wait and see.

409
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,900
We'll then decide our next move.

410
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,370
It was my idea to switch

411
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,310
to gold and silver jewelry.

412
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,520
Though we're still wealthy now,

413
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,820
I know

414
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,270
you and the madam

415
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,230
can't let go of the hundred-year legacy.

416
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,380
You want to return to jade,

417
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,560
so

418
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,340
I'll help you do that as soon as possible.

419
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,950
- I...
- You've done very well.

420
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,480
Without your suggestion

421
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,850
and hard work,

422
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,850
we wouldn't have survived

423
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,900
this long.

424
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,840
I haven't done enough.

425
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Don't worry.

426
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,470
I'll ensure you get back to jade.

427
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,820
Because you are the best jade craftsman

428
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,510
in Yuncui City.

429
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,250
Sorry to interrupt.

430
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,240
(You know you're interrupting.)

431
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,520
Mr. Si, you're still awake?

432
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,340
Mr. Pei, aren't you also awake?

433
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,710
I was passing by and wanted to say hello.

434
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,860
(Being polite now?)

435
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,970
I should've visited your room first

436
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,900
to see if you're comfortable,

437
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,470
but I heard

438
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,040
you just went out.

439
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,720
It's rare to visit Yuncui City,

440
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,140
so I had to go out.

441
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,510
Every moment during the night
is precious, Mr. Pei.

442
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,080
Mr. Si, did you come

443
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,230
just to greet us?

444
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,370
You must have heard

445
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,900
our conversation.

446
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,820
Say what you want.

447
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,760
Though blunt,

448
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,270
Dandan sincerely seeks your help.

449
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,470
For the jade supply of Qipei Pavilion,

450
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,580
I won't let

451
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,480
our hundred-year legacy die

452
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,950
under my watch.

453
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,790
I see you're selling gold

454
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,620
and silver jewelry quite well.

455
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,790
With hundreds of people to feed,

456
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,320
I can't let my pride

457
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,860
ruin their lives.

458
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,070
Selling gold and silver jewelry
is a last resort,

459
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,180
but I haven't forgotten

460
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,040
our original intent.

461
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,470
- Really?
- Really.

462
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,950
Then I'll be frank.

463
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,510
My family only supplies

464
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,750
true jade lovers,

465
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,180
not gold and silver jewelers.

466
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,790
That's a rule set by my father years ago.

467
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,620
Mr. Pei, think carefully.

468
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,310
Every moment during the night is precious.

469
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,560
This...

470
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,230
I did the accounts today.

471
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,860
If I'm correct,

472
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,690
we can sustain

473
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,420
for four more months

474
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,270
without gold and silver jewelry.

475
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,030
You do know me.

476
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,760
You never wanted to sell
gold and silver jewelry.

477
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,140
It was for the emergency.

478
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,130
Oh, I forgot to mention.

479
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,280
When Liu brought the ladies in today,

480
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,240
he found

481
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,930
they were all poor girls saved

482
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,900
by Si Ruyu.

483
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,320
He's been alone

484
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,710
for many years.

485
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,100
I secretly investigated.

486
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,930
Three years ago,

487
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,070
his wife died in childbirth,

488
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,270
and the child didn't survive.

489
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,070
He hasn't remarried since.

490
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,100
Do you think

491
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,610
there's a hidden story?

492
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,270
He's definitely more complicated
than he appears,

493
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,070
but only he knows

494
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,820
the details.

495
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,280
Forget it.

496
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,890
As long as he supplies us with jade,

497
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,420
and with your craftsmanship,

498
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,080
our family

499
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,030
will surely rise again.

500
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,820
But...

501
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,800
But without gold and silver jewelry,

502
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,370
we'll have no income.

503
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,210
How will you

504
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,420
compensate me?

505
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,180
Compensate?

506
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,650
When you marry me,

507
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,140
won't it all be yours?

508
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,560
Marry you?

509
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,890
Nonsense.

510
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,790
Who's marrying you?

511
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,100
You kept saying "our family" just now.

512
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,070
If you don't marry me,

513
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,270
where will you go?

514
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,620
What are you talking about?

515
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,420
Now no one will disturb us.

516
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,770
Miss,

517
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,750
you...

518
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,480
The young master said he was thirsty.

519
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,170
I came to make tea

520
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,210
but got lost.

521
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,650
I have other tasks.

522
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,370
Please take it to his room.

523
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,340
Don't keep him waiting.

524
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,810
Okay.

525
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,690
What are you doing?

526
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,710
Someone wants to harm you.

527
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,070
I passed by the kitchen and saw it.

528
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,030
Otherwise, you'd be dead by now.

529
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,100
Thank you for saving me.

530
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,710
But who wants to harm me?

531
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,230
Beware of those around you.

532
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,420
Stay safe.

533
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,220
(Si Mansion)

534
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,920
Ruyu,

535
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,580
you're finally back.

536
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,810
Brother,

537
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,530
what's wrong?

538
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,270
Your wife had a postpartum hemorrhage.

539
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,380
The child didn't survive.

540
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,720
Our parents are old,

541
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,820
and you weren't here,

542
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,030
so I buried them.

543
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,750
Go visit their graves later.

544
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,140
(Si Mansion)

545
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,340
Young Master, it's time to eat.

546
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,100
You watched me grow up.

547
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,950
Tell me the truth.

548
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,470
How did Wanwan suddenly die of hemorrhage?

549
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,210
Young Master,

550
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,470
the young lady was always healthy.

551
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,790
I don't know what happened,

552
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,750
but that day, she suddenly fainted

553
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,420
while eating.

554
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,380
As a servant,

555
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,710
I didn't dare go in.

556
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,820
I only heard her crying in pain

557
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,380
until her voice faded.

558
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,730
Young Master,

559
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,510
I later snuck in to see.

560
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,650
Though her mouth and nose had been cleaned,

561
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,950
there was still black blood.

562
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,470
I fear...

563
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,420
(Could he really have done such a thing?)

564
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,240
- Father.
- Father, sorry for the waiting.

565
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,580
Please forgive me.

566
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,410
You're pregnant now. That must be hard.

567
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,550
No need for formalities.

568
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,930
After all, you're carrying

569
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,270
(Si Yuannian from Modu)
the future heir of our Si family.

570
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,320
Father,

571
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,660
but my brother is the legitimate eldest son.

572
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,990
Sit down.

573
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,470
With the Si family's current wealth,

574
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,470
we could sustain many generations.

575
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,130
Why do we still deal with jade

576
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,470
and only jade?

577
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,070
It's our livelihood,

578
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,270
our original intent.

579
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,420
We must honor our ancestors

580
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,510
and our own conscience.

581
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,340
But what did your brother do?

582
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,750
What's going on with the accounts?

583
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,380
Don't think I don't know

584
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,470
just because you help your brother

585
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,860
hide it from me.

586
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,180
Greed will only lead astray.

587
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,400
Father.

588
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,620
Let's not speak of this.

589
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,270
Focus on your health

590
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,620
and give our family

591
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,660
a healthy grandson.

592
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,030
I'm old now,

593
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,990
just waiting to pass on everything to Ruyu

594
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,950
and be with my grandchildren at home.

595
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,420
Let's eat.

596
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,070
Careful, Madam.

597
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,750
Careful, Madam.

598
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,580
Madam, have some soup.

599
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,120
Save me.

600
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,210
Save me.

601
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,730
Save me.

602
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,500
(Pei's Mansion)

603
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,730
Mr. Si. Mr. Si.

604
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,580
Time to get up.

605
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,870
Mr. Si.

606
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,180
Mr. Si.

607
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,970
Ms. Dandan, good morning.

608
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,080
Good morning, Ms. Dandan.

609
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,920
Morning.

610
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,390
Finally got to sleep in.

611
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,180
What do you need?

612
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,120
It's already late morning.

613
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,960
You hadn't come out yet.

614
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,070
I was worried about you.

615
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,370
Yes, sir.

616
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,680
You worried us.

617
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,600
Exactly.

618
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,250
You owe us for this.

619
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,930
Mr. Si, I came to talk

620
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,560
about something important.

621
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,400
This...

622
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,680
Such a nice day.

623
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,770
How about we invite Mr. Pei

624
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,930
to stroll around Yuncui City?

625
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,810
- No...
- Sure.

626
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,180
I wasn't finished.

627
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
Miss, some things can't be rushed.

628
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,870
Wait for the right moment.

629
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,290
Wait for me.

630
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,140
(Yuncui City)

631
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,430
Your weather here is odd.

632
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,970
It was sunny,

633
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,870
and now...

634
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,890
Yes. The weather's been unpredictable.

635
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,730
Sorry.

636
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,070
You seem disinterested.

637
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,550
You haven't bought anything.

638
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,830
Go ahead. I'll cover it.

639
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,220
Can you manage alone?

640
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,100
I've got Mr. Pei with me.

641
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,250
Don't worry.

642
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,300
Don't worry.

643
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,950
Alright then.

644
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,430
Don't follow me.

645
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,740
I'll wander alone.

646
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,300
You want to wander here alone?

647
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,730
Wait.

648
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,810
You go back.

649
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,990
I'll report to the master first.

650
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,990
