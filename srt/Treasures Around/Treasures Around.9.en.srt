(Suyu Pavilion)
Come in, please.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,110
- Take your time.
- Uncle.

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,320
Ms. Shuangshuang is truly a treasure.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,240
The low-priced jewelry she promoted

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,190
sold almost

28
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,440
as well as large jade ornaments.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,600
It was indeed profitable.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,270
That doesn't matter.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,270
Do you know what's more important?

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,990
Please enlighten me.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Qipei Pavilion got inspired from somewhere

34
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,520
and made a batch of jewelry with broken jade.

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,110
I deliberately held back the news,

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,750
and released our goods a few days
before theirs.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,440
With Suyu Pavilion's reputation

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,230
and Shuangshuang's skills,

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
our items sold out immediately.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,230
While Qipei Pavilion's pieces

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
didn't sell,

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,950
they were even criticized as copycats.

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,230
Ridiculous.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,910
Brilliant, truly brilliant.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
Shuangshuang.

46
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,510
Young Master.

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,000
I was childish before.

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,630
I didn't expect your strategy
to be so effective.

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,320
For Qipei Pavilion to recover,

50
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,440
they'd have to sell the Crown

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,600
they embezzled.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,000
What's wrong? Not happy?

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,190
Nothing.

54
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,560
It's just that this issue
is troubling my sister.

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,190
Seeing her anxious

56
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,440
makes me unhappy too.

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,670
Why not bring your sister to Suyu Pavilion?

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,400
She can be with you

59
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,120
and help me.

60
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,440
Why not?

61
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,070
You must be joking, Young Master.

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,070
Everyone has their own ambitions.

63
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,440
We can't force it.

64
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,630
Alright then.

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,000
Some fresh fruits from the west
are in the backyard.

66
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,310
Have a taste.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Let's go.

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,720
The mist is poisonous.

69
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,190
You go first.

70
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,790
I entrust my daughter to you.

71
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,320
Take good care of her.

72
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,460
(Complicacy in Everything)

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,950
What are you doing?

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,560
Come, Dandan.

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
Get up, get up.

76
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,350
Hurry and get up.

77
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,520
Madam, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,640
I failed your expectations.

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,520
Please punish me harshly.

80
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,550
Do you mean the incident

81
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,470
about the broken jade jewelry?

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,400
It was all my bad idea,

83
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,310
causing you to lose money.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
Come, come.

85
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,360
Get up.

86
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,470
How could it be a bad idea?

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,230
If it was,

88
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,470
why would the Su family follow it?

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
This time, we were slow to react.

90
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,910
It's not your fault.

91
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,990
But Madam...

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,350
They were just scraps,

93
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,960
not worth much.

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,240
Madam,

95
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,550
I know you are kind-hearted,

96
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,670
and reluctant to punish me.

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,990
But this time,

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,080
we lost 1,800 taels.

99
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,670
It was laborious and time-consuming,

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
making things worse.

101
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,160
Please punish me harshly.

102
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,870
It's just 1,800 taels.

103
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,270
We can handle it.

104
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,280
We won't starve.

105
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,720
I've seen worse over the years.

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,430
Even if we sell our assets,

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,840
we can survive for a while.

108
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
For now,

109
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,990
fulfilling the City Lord's commission

110
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,280
is the priority.

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,430
You and Pei must focus
on the fragrant jade items

112
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,520
to turn things around.

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,760
If there's another mistake,

114
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,430
we'll discuss punishment then.

115
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,080
Alright, alright.

116
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,840
Madam, I'll never

117
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,790
forget your kindness.

118
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,910
You and Pei should start working

119
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,200
on mass-producing the fragrant jewelry.

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
You can go now.

121
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,040
Thank you, Madam.

122
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,630
Don't laugh.

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,110
I'm in this state, and you're laughing.

124
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,790
I'm really worried about the Pei family.

125
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
What can I say about you?

126
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,670
You're always careless,

127
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,160
and always sick in bed.

128
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,470
You're not like my maid.

129
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
See?

130
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,280
Who's taking care of whom now?

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
Young Master, I'm sorry.

132
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,270
Don't worry.

133
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,750
- My health...
- I know.

134
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,350
You're as strong as a cow
and will recover soon.

135
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,280
Eat well and you'll be back to work soon.

136
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,600
Who are you calling a cow?

137
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,550
Liu, Liu.

138
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,200
Coming.

139
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,040
Here it is.

140
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,350
Alright, stay still.

141
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,230
Young Master, look at you.

142
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Are you still

143
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,670
my Young Master?

144
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,390
Come.

145
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,390
Eat now.

146
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
Alright. I won't joke.

147
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,870
Don't worry too much

148
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,840
about the broken jade jewelry.

149
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,670
They're there anyway.

150
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,310
We can sell it later

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,440
when it's in demand again.

152
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,520
Do we have

153
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,910
enough savings?

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
Yes.

155
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,850
Really?

156
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,760
Of course.

157
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,470
And the fragrant bracelets.

158
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,080
We can't delay anymore.

159
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,960
I've arranged everything.

160
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,520
They'll be available for pre-sale tomorrow.

161
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
We can pre-sell about 50.

162
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,990
Once we get feedback,

163
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,520
we can mass-produce them.

164
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,720
This loss can be recovered.

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,200
Focus on getting better

166
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
before worrying about these things.

167
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
Eat more.

168
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
You always take small bites.

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,640
Take big bites.

170
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,220
(Qipei Pavilion)

171
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,110
Take care.

172
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,940
(Pei's Mansion)

173
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,790
Pei,

174
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,070
how is Dandan's injury?

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,240
I've given her

176
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,590
the best ointment.

177
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,120
She should be healed by now.

178
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,480
Mother, sit down.

179
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,150
Mother,

180
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,480
you don't blame her, do you?

181
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,760
Do you think it's her fault?

182
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,750
No.

183
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,070
Then it's settled.

184
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,550
I'm not unreasonable.

185
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,910
Did you tell her

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
about our financial troubles?

187
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,670
What's the use?

188
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
It would only add pressure

189
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,830
and worries.

190
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,670
The City Lord values the fragrant jade project.

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,550
If we seize this opportunity,

192
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,640
things might improve.

193
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
Pei,

194
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,910
you just go ahead.

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
Don't worry, Mother.

196
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,910
Dandan's idea is innovative,

197
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,480
better than Suyu Pavilion's.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,910
We already have some pre-sales.

199
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,790
Profits are just around the corner.

200
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,240
Madam, Young Master,

201
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,650
someone is looking for you in the front hall.

202
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Mother, you should go back to your room.

203
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,430
I'll go take a look.

204
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,550
Let's go.

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
(Pei,)

206
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,480
(you've grown up.)

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,070
(You can't always be under my protection.)

208
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,710
(Face the storms with Dandan.)

209
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Jue,

210
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,520
I really underestimated you.

211
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,880
This act could bankrupt the Pei family.

212
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,550
What act?

213
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,670
You don't know?

214
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
What should I know?

215
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,280
The Pei family is in trouble again.

216
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
(Qipei Pavilion)
Everyone, look! Look!

217
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,670
This is the fake product Qipei Pavilion sells.

218
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,070
Everyone, look!

219
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,310
What happened? It was fine just now.

220
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,640
This is the lousy fragrant jade bracelet

221
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,070
from Qipei Pavilion.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,430
My wife wore it for just a few hours,

223
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,790
and now she looks like this.

224
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,390
At first,

225
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,160
her wrist itched.

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,710
Then it blistered.

227
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,910
Now it's all over her body.

228
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,830
She has a high fever and is delirious.

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,640
If you don't give us an explanation,

230
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I won't let you off.

231
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,040
How can a bracelet cause such a reaction?

232
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
I should ask you.

233
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,160
Are you sure this bracelet

234
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,360
is from Qipei Pavilion?

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,200
You, you...

236
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,910
Everyone, look!

237
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,480
The Pei family's young master is denying it.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,790
All the people who bought the bracelet with me

239
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
- are here to testify.
- Yes.

240
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,310
Even your salesman recognized it
as your bracelet.

241
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,430
And you're still denying it.

242
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,390
Today,

243
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,360
I'll smash your signboard.

244
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,760
No, stop him.

245
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,070
Let's see who dares.

246
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,150
- Liu.
- You...

247
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,260
You're hitting people now?

248
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,040
The Pei family goes too far.

249
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,190
Let's smash their shop.

250
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,360
Smash their signboard.

251
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,880
Smash!

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
Smash their shop!

253
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,770
Smash!

254
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,400
Smash their signboard!

255
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Stop throwing.

256
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,310
Stop, stop.

257
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,160
You bully!

258
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,240
Scammers! Crooked shop!

259
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Stop throwing. Let's talk.

260
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,590
- Smash them!
- Stop throwing.

261
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,840
Don't think you can do business anymore.

262
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
Crooked shop.

263
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,320
- Crooked shop.
- Get out.

264
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,400
Don't think about doing business.

265
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,280
Everyone, calm down.

266
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,910
We'll give you an explanation.

267
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,950
Please get up.

268
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,120
If your wife's illness

269
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,400
is truly caused by our bracelet,

270
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,360
we will take full responsibility.

271
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,430
But until it's clear,

272
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,040
the most important thing now

273
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,910
is to treat her.

274
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,280
Here, take this money

275
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,760
to find a doctor for your wife.

276
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,310
We don't need your dirty money.

277
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,710
You have two days.

278
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,360
If there's no result,

279
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,790
or if my wife's condition worsens,

280
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,190
even if we'll die together,

281
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,360
I won't let you off.

282
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,000
Move.

283
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,910
Everyone, leave.

284
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,150
Leave.

285
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,910
Interesting.

286
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Someone hates the Pei family more than I do.

287
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,020
(Kylin of Auspiciousness)

288
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,400
The troublemaking couple has gone home.

289
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,400
I've arranged for the best doctor

290
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,240
to visit them.

291
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,190
But this incident

292
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,950
has affected other shops too,

293
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,950
except the one in question.

294
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,160
Now any shop

295
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,830
with the Qipei Pavilion name

296
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,430
has people protesting,

297
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,790
demanding closure.

298
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,000
At this rate,

299
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,000
our business won't continue.

300
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,550
If all our shops

301
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,240
stop operating,

302
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
how long can our savings last?

303
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,120
Maybe

304
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,790
only a month.

305
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,710
We need to restore Qipei Pavilion's reputation

306
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,000
within a month.

307
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,190
Madam, Mr. Tan is here.

308
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,600
Madam.

309
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Thank you for coming.

310
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,760
How did this happen?

311
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,880
I should ask you.

312
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,910
Qipei Pavilion
has been selling jade for decades

313
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,310
without such issues.

314
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,670
My fragrances

315
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,520
are made

316
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,430
from non-toxic plants.

317
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,160
They supply dozens of jade shops,

318
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,070
including the largest, Suyu Pavilion.

319
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,760
They use the same batch

320
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,790
as you.

321
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,520
Dandan personally inspected each batch.

322
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,950
Suyu Pavilion has sold

323
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,590
over a hundred scented jade sachets,

324
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,480
with no such problems.

325
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
Madam,

326
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,640
restoring reputation is slower

327
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,070
than clearing misunderstandings.

328
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,350
Clearing misunderstandings?

329
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,830
Mr. Tan is right.

330
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,950
If the fragrance was toxic,

331
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,070
the farmer who touched the jade

332
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,550
would've been affected too.

333
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,760
If neither Qipei Pavilion
nor Tan's Perfume Shop

334
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
is at fault,

335
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,550
then the couple is framing us,

336
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,760
or being used

337
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,280
to target us.

338
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
Either way,

339
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,790
we must uncover the truth

340
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,710
and clear Qipei Pavilion's name.

341
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,550
Then we'll have our reputation back.

342
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,040
But with witnesses and evidence,

343
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,590
how do we prove our innocence?

344
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,480
Madam,

345
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,070
if you trust me,

346
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm willing to investigate.

347
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,790
I trust you,

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
but this involves life and death

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,910
and is complex.

350
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,430
You're just a girl. You...

351
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,270
Mother,

352
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,910
has she ever done anything

353
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,310
like a typical girl?

354
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,710
We have no better options.

355
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,240
Let her try.

356
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,640
I'll accompany her.

357
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,760
Qipei Pavilion doesn't have much time left

358
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
for you to investigate.

359
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,000
Three days.

360
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,910
Give me three days.

361
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,480
If we find nothing,

362
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,950
I'll resign.

363
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,670
Mother, trust us.

364
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,040
We will uncover the truth.

365
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,510
Madam,

366
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,720
no matter what,

367
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,190
Tan's Perfume Shop

368
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,310
is partly involved with the scented bracelet.

369
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,760
I'll go with them.

370
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,480
If there are any poisons in the fragrances,

371
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
I can identify them.

372
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,240
Children,

373
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,550
be careful and act cautiously.

374
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,390
Let's go.

375
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,960
Shopkeeper Hao,

376
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,400
you need to come up with alternative plans.

377
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,950
If they can't uncover the truth,

378
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,670
whether by clearing out the stock
or switching sales channels,

379
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,120
we must overcome this challenge.

380
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,550
Yes, Madam.

381
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,790
I'll get to it right away.

382
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,950
When will the heavens

383
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,670
stop testing Qipei Pavilion?

384
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,480
I pray for the safety

385
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,280
of the children.

386
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,550
This happened suddenly and inexplicably,

387
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,190
but from what I saw,

388
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
the symptoms were unprecedented and bizarre.

389
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,150
Young Master,

390
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,640
Qipei Pavilion has been surrounded

391
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,430
and their business can't continue.

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Great.

393
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,120
I've heard of people getting drunk
without drinking,

394
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,040
but I've never heard of a business
destroying itself.

395
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,000
Strange.

396
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,790
How did this happen out of nowhere?

397
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,350
I thought it was you.

398
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
It wasn't me.

399
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,520
Young Master, you called for me?

400
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,950
Shuangshuang,

401
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,550
did you hear
about the Qipei Pavilion incident?

402
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,840
Young Master,

403
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,150
you don't think it was me, do you?

404
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,670
Don't misunderstand.

405
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,680
Because of the previous broken jade incident,

406
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,350
you delivered a critical blow
to Qipei Pavilion,

407
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,350
so I thought it might be you.

408
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,800
But it doesn't matter.

409
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Even if it was you, it's fine.

410
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,000
You did it for Suyu Pavilion, after all.

411
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,790
Young Master, you're joking.

412
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,150
The broken jade accessories

413
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,480
were just a small skill

414
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,590
that I have.

415
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,630
Adding glory to Suyu Pavilion

416
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,150
is my duty.

417
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,830
As for this incident,

418
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,150
it involves harming lives.

419
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,680
I cannot accept that.

420
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,800
Besides,

421
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,520
I don't have that much capability.

422
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,830
You don't need to explain so much.

423
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,350
I was just casually asking.

424
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,520
I thought it was you, Young Master.

425
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,590
How could it be me?

426
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,470
Then...

427
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,870
It's really not me.

428
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Anyway, it's not me.

429
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,560
Right.

430
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,200
To secure Suyu Pavilion's
century-old foundation,

431
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
I would use certain means.

432
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
But under these circumstances,

433
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,760
I wouldn't do

434
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,280
such a wicked thing.

435
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,470
Moreover,

436
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,240
we're also making

437
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,680
fragrant jade jewelry.

438
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,870
This incident

439
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,720
is of no benefit to us.

440
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,560
First,

441
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,350
what if we are

442
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,070
the next one to be affected?

443
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,360
Second,

444
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,280
you saw it.

445
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
After Qipei Pavilion's incident,

446
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,550
even you suspected me.

447
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,070
What would outsiders think?

448
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,960
So, Young Master, what are your plans?

449
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
We need to plan ahead

450
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,760
and be careful.

451
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,760
We must uncover the truth

452
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,000
about the poisoned bracelet.

453
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,870
Jue is right.

454
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,680
We must find the cause of the illness asap

455
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,040
to get a leg up.

456
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,760
If it's due to the fragrance,

457
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,630
we've used it too.

458
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,240
If this happens to us,

459
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,630
we can't fail the City Lord.

460
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,760
Yes.

461
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,520
I heard the poisoned woman

462
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,790
looks horrible,

463
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,790
covered in sores, with a high fever,

464
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,070
rambling nonsense.

465
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,110
Some say she's cursed.

466
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,550
Young Master, I have an idea.

467
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
As we investigate,

468
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,310
we should disguise ourselves.

469
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,560
Disguise?

470
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,310
So you dressed me like this?

471
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,360
Of course.

472
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,000
We're a group of men

473
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,520
with one girl.

474
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,560
It's inconvenient.

475
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,080
Plus,

476
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,150
there's a bad guy

477
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
eyeing your beauty.

478
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,960
We need to be careful.

479
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,790
Young Master,

480
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,830
have you been reading too many storybooks?

481
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,960
Do you really think
changing my clothes and hair

482
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,590
will make people believe I'm a man?

483
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,340
Like Zhu Yingtai in "Butterfly Lovers"?

484
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
Of course, they won't tell.

485
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,760
- Look, who could tell?
- Come and see!

486
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,390
Miss,

487
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,920
come and see our hairpins.

488
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,310
They're beautiful.

489
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,380
- She's not talking to you.
- This hairpin suits you.

490
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,310
She's talking to someone else.

491
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,550
Looks nice, and it only needs three wen.

492
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,920
Miss, new rouge. Come and try.

493
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,440
Come and see.

494
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,870
You can try it.

495
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,760
She's talking to that ugly painter.

496
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,870
She's asking him to buy rouge.

497
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,110
Buy a bouquet of flowers.

498
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,670
Miss.

499
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,720
Let the guy buy you flowers.

500
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,590
I don't want flowers, thank you.

501
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,710
Goodbye, Miss.

502
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,670
Goodbye.

503
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,630
Want flowers?

504
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,110
Dressed as a man? Unrecognizable?

505
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,720
Today is nice.

506
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,040
The sun is bright.

507
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,240
Careful with the sunburn.

508
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,950
- It's raining, isn't it?
- Flowers for sale.

509
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,950
Do you want to buy flowers?

510
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,480
Can't they tell?

511
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,920
Can't they tell?

512
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,920
No, they won't tell.

513
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,040
Why hasn't Dandan returned

514
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,520
after so long?

515
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,350
Liu is with her.

516
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,350
No need to worry. Sit down.

517
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,830
But

518
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,390
I can't feel at ease

519
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,390
without seeing Dandan.

520
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,350
You should stop your unrealistic thoughts
about Dandan.

521
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,630
She's not interested in you.

522
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,870
How do you know?

523
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,150
She said so herself.

524
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,630
Well, people

525
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,630
can change, right?

526
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,000
Before Dandan joined Qipei Pavilion,

527
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,960
she was innocent, hardworking, and kind.

528
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,200
She would've never thought

529
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,790
she'd get involved in such complex matters.

530
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,760
What do you mean?

531
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,150
Are you saying

532
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,630
I made Dandan cunning and worldly?

533
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
You said it yourself.

534
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,280
Dandan has always been pure.

535
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,070
Don't say nonsense.

536
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,630
Dandan may have lived poorly before,

537
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,240
but she was freer

538
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,390
and happier.

539
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,950
I'll personally deliver

540
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,390
your painting in two days

541
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,720
- to your mansion.
- Sure.

542
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,910
Thank you, Mr. Tan.

543
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Please, no need to see me off.

544
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,830
This is the famous painter.

545
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
So impressive.

546
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,830
Mr. Tan, your meal is ready.

547
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,630
Two taels in total.

548
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,800
You?

549
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,240
Weren't you a stable hand
at the general's mansion?

550
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,110
Why are you delivering meals
at Fengming Tower now?

551
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,390
You remember me?

552
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,470
Of course.

553
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,280
You were the first female stable hand
I ever saw.

554
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,960
It left a deep impression.

555
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,070
That was just a side job.

556
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,390
I take work wherever I can find it.

557
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,760
I do a bit of everything.

558
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,910
Two taels.

559
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,880
Here.

560
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,000
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

561
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
Wait a minute.

562
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,680
Since you're willing to do any job,

563
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,150
how about another one?

564
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,350
Of course, I don't mind.

565
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,280
What's the job? How much does it pay?

566
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,350
I need an assistant in my studio.

567
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
Ten days a month.

568
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,960
Starting with preparing paper and ink.

569
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,070
Eventually, you'll help with mixing colors.

570
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,200
I'll make sure

571
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
you're well-paid.

572
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,310
Are you interested?

573
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,760
Yes. This is much easier than running errands.

574
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,830
Thank you, Mr. Tan, for the opportunity.

575
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Young Master.

576
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,880
I've found out.

577
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,280
This couple is from out of town.

578
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,200
They recently moved to Yuncui City,

579
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,280
living at the edge of the woods in the suburbs.

580
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,920
They're of modest means

581
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,870
but bought the first batch
of scented jade bracelets.

582
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,550
That's strange.

583
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,280
After the incident,

584
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,390
they refused any compensation

585
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,720
and just wanted to make a big fuss.

586
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,200
They're clearly being used by someone.

587
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,720
You found out so quickly.

588
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,760
Of course.

589
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
I grew up running around the streets,

590
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,390
eating from many households,
and doing various jobs.

591
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,680
You should know me better.

592
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,760
Of course, I remember.

593
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,990
Dandan.

594
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,920
You must be exhausted

595
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,150
after all this running around.

596
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,200
Here, have your favorite...

597
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,040
Who said she likes that?

598
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,240
Dandan's favorite

599
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,920
is peanuts,

600
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,630
right?

601
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,390
Eat more.

602
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
So,

603
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,590
Qipei Pavilion and Suyu Pavilion

604
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,070
used the same batch of perfume,

605
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,280
yet Suyu Pavilion remains unaffected. Why?

606
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,440
Are you implying

607
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,720
that Su Jue is behind this?

608
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,110
It's hard to say now,

609
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,360
but I don't think

610
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,350
it's Su Jue's style.

611
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,000
He's also involved

612
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,350
in the fragrant jade business.

613
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,520
If the Pei family is in trouble,

614
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,110
he'd be the first suspect.

615
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,960
Plus, he just won the top prize

616
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,240
at the Jade Competition.

617
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,310
He could be the top jade dealer

618
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,350
in Yuncui City.

619
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,480
There's no need

620
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,560
for him to get involved in this mess.

621
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,390
Good point.

622
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,950
Anyway,

623
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,590
we should investigate further.

624
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,080
Young Master,

625
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,440
do you think this is a lady trouble

626
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,790
from your youthful indiscretions?

627
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,920
Is that why someone
is smearing Qipei Pavilion?

628
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,680
Are you trying to smear me?

629
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,280
Mr. Tan,

630
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,940
do you think this is a lady trouble

631
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,080
from your youthful indiscretions?

632
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,350
Is that why someone is smearing

633
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,720
the scented jade business?

634
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,070
Why are you smearing me?

635
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,070
You're acting suspiciously.

636
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,680
You must be hiding something.

637
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,680
You should continue to smear me.

638
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,120
Darling.

639
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,070
How did you get so sick?

640
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,150
How is it?

641
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,080
Young Master,

642
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,590
this woman's illness seems real.

643
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,040
If she were just a pawn,

644
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,590
she wouldn't be acting this well.

645
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,310
So, what should we do now?

646
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,550
To uncover the truth,

647
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,350
we have three steps.

648
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,670
Which are?

649
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
Entice,

650
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,440
deceive,

651
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,650
and coerce.

652
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
Go.

653
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,200
Entice.

654
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,520
Who are you?

655
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,280
The boss said

656
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
you did a great job.

657
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,760
I'm here to give you more money.

658
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,920
You must have the wrong person.

659
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,120
What boss?

660
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,520
Stop talking nonsense.

661
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,120
Relax.

662
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,960
No one will trace this back to you.

663
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,950
We're on the same side.

664
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,740
- Stop being so nervous.
- Who's on the same side as you?

665
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,800
Are you crazy?

666
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,280
I see you're reliable,

667
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,960
so I wanted to discuss some big business.

668
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,310
Why can't you take a hint?

669
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm not interested in your jokes.

670
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,630
Go back to where you came from.

671
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,630
Get lost.

672
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,880
Deceive.

673
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,550
To be honest,

674
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,040
I'm here to investigate the framing.

675
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,790
Your boss has been caught

676
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,840
and confessed everything.

677
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,350
Stop resisting.

678
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,670
Tell me.

679
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,550
Why frame Qipei Pavilion?

680
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,670
Tell me.

681
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,150
Tell... me.

682
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,280
Why frame Qipei Pavilion?

683
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,590
- Tell me.
- Get lost.

684
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Fine.

685
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,630
Crazy man.

686
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,390
Come over here.

687
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,960
- Young Master.
- Come over here.

688
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Young Master.

689
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,190
It's okay.

690
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,350
Since they won't cooperate,

691
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,310
let's not be polite.

692
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,000
Coerce. Let's go.

693
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,320
Come out.

694
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
- Come out.
- Come out.

695
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,470
- Where's the money?
- Come out.

696
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
If you don't hand over the money,

697
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,550
- we'll burn this place down.
- Come out.

698
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,620
- You found someone to coerce them so quickly?
- Come out.

699
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,050
- Me?
- Hand over the money.

700
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,920
Gentlemen.

701
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
Gentlemen.

702
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,710
Hand it over.

703
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,920
When will you pay

704
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,240
this month's protection fee?

705
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,200
Gentlemen, please have mercy.

706
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,040
Qipei Pavilion cheated us.

707
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,040
My wife is gravely ill,

708
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
and all the money went to medicine.

709
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
I really have no money now.

710
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,310
That's not our problem.

711
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,150
Exactly.

712
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,680
The protection fee can't be short
by a single coin.

713
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,680
Or we'll beat you to death.

714
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,190
Hand it over.

715
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,870
- What's going on?
- Hurry up.

716
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,390
Liu said his wife

717
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,070
is indeed very ill.

718
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,350
- If he's being used
- Hand it over.

719
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,680
- to frame Qipei Pavilion,
- Hurry up.

720
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,310
he wouldn't be in such dire straits.

721
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,860
Hurry up with the money.

722
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,930
- Did we wrong him?
- I'll kneel for you.

723
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,630
Let's help him first.

724
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,760
Collecting protection fees in broad daylight.

725
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,520
The City Lord didn't order this.

726
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,760
What are you doing?

727
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,080
Robbing people?

728
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,280
Where did you come from?

729
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,040
Who are you? Mind your own business.

730
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,520
How much do they owe? I'll pay.

731
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,110
Quite a bit.

732
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,150
Since you're offering so much,

733
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,920
we might as well ask for more.

734
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
Forget it.

735
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,480
- That's enough.
- Listen to me.

736
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,790
Is there more? Hand it all over,

737
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,680
or I'll search for it.

738
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,680
- Get lost.
- You'll regret this.

739
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,790
Let me tell you.

740
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,920
How dare you hit my brother!

741
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,280
- I'll go get backup.
- Get lost.

742
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,170
- You'll regret this.
- Don't run!

743
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,020
- You'll regret this.
- Wait.

744
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,910
Get lost.

745
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,000
Thank you so much.

746
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,680
Darling.

747
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,560
Darling.

748
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,000
We run

749
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,830
a small tea plantation,

750
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,550
working hard under the sun every day

751
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,480
while fending off

752
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,070
the extortion of local thugs.

753
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,110
In all our years of marriage,

754
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,040
I've never been able

755
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,200
to buy her a proper gift.

756
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,600
Recently,

757
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I scraped together our savings

758
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,000
to buy the trendy scented jade bracelet.

759
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,350
But I never imagined...

760
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,150
It seems we misunderstood him.

761
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,070
In my desperation, I lost my mind

762
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,520
and caused trouble at your shop.

763
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,150
Please, have mercy

764
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,440
and save my wife.

765
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,680
What did the doctor say?

766
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,680
The doctors you sent couldn't find the cause

767
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,630
and left after giving vague answers.

768
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,960
What about the scented jade?

769
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,200
It was tied with colored thread.

770
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,520
After the incident,

771
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,830
I thought it was unlucky

772
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,440
and threw it by the river.

773
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,520
The spot where her wrist touched the bracelet

774
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,680
is the worst.

775
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,070
It must be related.

776
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,590
But others who smelled the scent

777
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,240
were unharmed,

778
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,800
so the perfume

779
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,830
is not the problem.

780
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
We need to find the scented jade.

781
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,440
Only by understanding the cause

782
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,760
can we treat her.

783
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Let's go.

784
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,350
I'll show you the way.

785
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,550
Ms. Shuangshuang, what brings you here?

786
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,000
Long time no see, Doctor Qu.

787
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,590
This is Su Jue, owner of Suyu Pavilion.

788
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,520
Mr. Su.

789
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,680
Please, this way.

790
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,190
Tea, please.

791
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,110
Here. Have a seat.

792
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,590
Doctor Qu is the best doctor

793
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,870
in the region.

794
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,360
He's been away from worldly affairs for years

795
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,440
and retired here,

796
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,040
selling herbs to make a living.

797
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,640
You flatter me.

798
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,760
Years ago,

799
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,590
powerful nobles forced me to serve them,

800
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,630
leaving me and my son nowhere to go.

801
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,920
Thankfully, Ms. Shuangshuang saved us.

802
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,230
Thankfully, we met Ms. Shuangshuang.

803
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,960
With her gentle persuasion and comfort,

804
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,440
I left my troubles behind

805
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,880
and realized a simple life is a true happiness.

806
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,840
Shuangshuang is always

807
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,800
so kind and considerate.

808
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,150
What brings you two here today?

809
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,840
Qipei Pavilion had a poisoned bracelet.

810
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,110
Have you heard about it?

811
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,630
I've heard a little.

812
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,110
The symptoms of that farmer's wife
are quite strange.

813
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,670
I heard many doctors are baffled.

814
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,230
What are the symptoms?

815
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,920
Sores all over the body,
dark circles around the eyes,

816
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,590
shivering, speaking nonsense, and confused.

817
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,160
Mr. Su,

818
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,440
this happened at your competitor
Qipei Pavilion.

819
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,320
Why are you so concerned?

820
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,710
This issue affects not just Qipei Pavilion

821
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,750
but also the scented jade.

822
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,190
It concerns the reputation
of the entire jade industry.

823
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,880
To be honest,

824
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,320
if we don't find the cause,

825
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,040
the next victim might be Suyu Pavilion.

826
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,800
So, I hope you can help us.

827
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,000
How rare.

828
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,590
Such foresight and concern from Mr. Su.

829
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,510
Not at all.

830
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,440
If what you say is true,

831
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,920
this farmer's wife is not suffering
from ordinary poison.

832
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,000
That's likely the Jiangtou weed.

833
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,110
- Jiangtou weed?
- Jiangtou weed?

834
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,110
It's a mix of medicine and dark arts.

835
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Those afflicted will suffer
severe physical and mental damage.

836
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I haven't heard of such methods

837
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,360
for a long time.

838
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,710
Is there a cure?

839
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,270
I do have one method.

840
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,670
That should be the path the farmer mentioned.

841
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,040
Turn there, and we'll reach the riverbank.

842
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
The jade is on the first stone by the river.

843
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,670
Let's hurry and find it.

844
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
It's them.

845
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,710
The ones who hurt our brothers.

846
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,800
You've got some nerve.

847
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,880
None of you are leaving today.

848
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,030
I...

849
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,800
There are too many of them.

850
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,360
Go back and get reinforcements.

851
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,470
What about you?

852
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,430
Don't worry.

853
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,070
We'll try to hold them off.

854
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,240
Hurry.

855
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,000
Young Master, hold on!

856
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,670
Don't chase him. Capture them first.

857
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,320
I... What now?

858
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,880
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't be afraid.

859
