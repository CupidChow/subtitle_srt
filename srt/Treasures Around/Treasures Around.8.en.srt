(Chang's Fabric Shop)

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,750
The amethyst crystal tassels in this draft

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,910
and the butterfly button craftsmanship
require meticulous attention.

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,880
When you return, tell the craftsmen

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,990
to focus on refining them.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
Rest assured.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,910
Shuangshuang, you're amazing.

30
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,350
You're my lifesaver.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,440
With these,

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,960
they will surely be impressed by me.

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
This looks great.

34
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,230
Ms. Dandan.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
Mr. Tan.

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you here?

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,320
I ordered a batch of raw materials for perfume.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
That wasn't easy.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,600
I came here for a drink of water.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,950
Didn't expect you two to be here too.

41
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,600
Perfume? Weren't you running an art studio?

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,510
Yes, but recently I opened a perfume shop.

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Painting has taken a back seat.

44
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,510
Not only are you good-looking,

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,750
but you're also talented.

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,040
Whatever you do, you'll succeed.

47
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,030
Oh, stop it.

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,320
If you don't mind,

49
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,950
why not go to my perfume shop for a chat?

50
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,070
I'll give you some newly arrived perfume.

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,720
- Sure.
- Okay.

I'm on a short leave. I'm afraid...

54
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,190
It won't take long.

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Please.

Please, ladies, come inside.

60
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,380
It smells wonderful here.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,070
Working here must be blissful.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,790
Come and see this cabinet.

63
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,280
This here is called an aroma stone.

64
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,670
Drop essential oils on it,

65
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,510
and it emits a lasting fragrance.

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,350
Perfect for the living room or bedroom.

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
To the right.

68
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,510
On the right is perfume.

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
We mix

70
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,630
various perfumes with water,

71
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,160
which can be sprinkled on hair ends or clothes,

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,230
and the fragrance lasts a long time.

73
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,400
Please, ladies, have a seat.

74
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,790
These in front of you are powders.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,950
They can be sprinkled directly
inside wardrobes to scent clothes,

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,560
or mixed with blush or face powder.

77
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,190
They're very versatile.

78
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,750
I didn't realize perfumes, small as they are,

79
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,880
have so much knowledge behind them.

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,750
I've been narrow-minded before.

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Oh, come on.

82
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,040
Just making a living.

83
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,880
But how did you decide

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
to change your art studio into a perfume shop?

85
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,470
You don't know.

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,470
Recently, the City Lord issued a policy,

87
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,320
encouraging various perfume
and fragrance shops.

88
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,000
Everyone is rushing to seize the market.

89
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,110
In the future, the perfume trade

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,630
will be the most profitable
business opportunity.

91
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,000
Why haven't I heard of it?

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,310
You're always engrossed in jade.

93
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,230
How would you care

94
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,640
about our small businesses?

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,110
Mr. Tan, you jest.

96
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,040
Business is business, big or small.

97
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,550
But you, untouched by worldly affairs,

98
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,520
have also begun exploring paths to wealth.

99
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,470
Looks like my influence over the years
hasn't been in vain.

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,440
You finally realized it.

101
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
Oh, stop it.

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,960
Shall I try some perfume powder
and rouge for you ladies?

103
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,980
- Sure.
- Sure.

104
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,640
It's getting dark.

105
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,310
Why hasn't she returned yet?

106
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,190
Young Master,

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,550
Cuiliu's matter has been settled.

108
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,910
I've let her take the money and leave.

109
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,350
Has Dandan returned?

110
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,910
Not yet.

111
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,230
She's chatting with her sister.

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,870
It may take more time.

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,160
But it's getting dark.

114
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,870
I don't know.

115
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,830
No.

116
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,310
I have to find her.

117
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll go with you.

118
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
Don't follow me.

119
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,110
Put the bottom bracket for the mandarin ducks
on Shuangshuang's workstation.

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,160
Where is she?

121
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,990
She took leave to spend time with her sister.

122
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,870
Young Master, didn't you give permission?

123
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,110
She went at noon. Hasn't she returned yet?

124
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,430
No.

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,870
Could she be in the shop?

126
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,720
I just came from there.

127
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,670
(Shuangshuang has always had a sense of time.)

128
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,310
Did she mention where she was going?

129
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Jixiang Teahouse.

130
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,870
- Such bad luck.
- Such bad luck.

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,990
What are you looking at?

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Thinking of past events.

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,230
Seeing you like this,

134
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,040
you're also looking for your Ms. Shan, right?

135
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,430
Your Ms. Shan is very strong.

136
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,670
Looks like she can open the sky.

137
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,200
No need to worry about her.

138
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,990
Your Ms. Shan

139
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,790
is like a fairy, uninterested in men.

140
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,310
No need to worry.

141
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,990
Your Ms. Shan is coarse and unsophisticated.

142
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,400
No one pays attention to her.

143
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,790
Your Ms. Shan is devoid of charm.

144
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,760
No one pays attention to her either.

145
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,040
Your Ms. Shan acts like this.

146
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,720
Like a man.

147
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,400
Your Ms. Shan acts like this.

148
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,190
Like a statue.

149
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,140
You...

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
What?

151
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,840
Gentlemen, calm down.

152
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,950
Calm down.

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
May I ask if you are looking

154
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,720
for two beautiful ladies?

155
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,550
- Only one is beautiful.
- Only one is beautiful.

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Doesn't matter.

157
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,910
I just wanted to inform you.

158
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,720
They left our teahouse long ago,

159
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,040
following a painter

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,080
to a perfume shop.

161
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,150
A perfume shop?

162
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,400
Looks like I misunderstood
your Shuangshuang.

163
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,350
She is still sought after.

164
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Shut up.

165
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,720
- Alright.
- Let me see.

166
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,710
Looks nice.

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,670
Mr. Tan, you're really talented.

168
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,520
Now, Shuangshuang

169
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,990
has the osmanthus fragrance lingering around,

170
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,200
and her complexion looks much rosier too.

171
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,360
Oh, thank you.

172
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,670
It's just a small effort.

173
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,080
Thank you, Mr. Tan.

174
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,190
I'd like some too.

175
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,790
Okay.

176
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,240
Let me see.

177
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,670
Looks like I misunderstood your Dandan too.

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,360
In front of other men,

179
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,070
she's still gentle and virtuous.

180
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,790
Shut up.

181
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Let me ask you.

182
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,190
Where did this painter come from?

183
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,950
At this point, don't act like that.

184
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,240
Put aside our personal grievances.

185
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,360
Are you really going to let him get his way?

186
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,280
He should be an old friend of Dandan's.

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,400
He came to my mansion once before.

188
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,670
But I don't know what he does exactly.

189
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,220
Let's go back and talk about it.

190
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,780
We can't let him get his way.

191
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,140
Let me try it on you.

192
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
(Peace and Tranquility)

193
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,020
Do you know what's most important

194
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,460
in a relationship?

195
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,460
It's that you cannot yield first.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,660
If you yield first,

197
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,420
you'll never be able to raise your head again.

198
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,820
Do you understand?

199
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,700
Time to eat.

200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,980
Come on.

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,460
What's that fragrance? Smells so good.

202
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,980
The dishes today are quite vegetarian.

203
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
It's not the fragrance of the food.

204
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,620
It's your fragrance.

205
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,900
Is it pleasant?

206
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,860
This is specially blended for me by Mr. Tan.

207
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,780
Peach blossom scented powder.

208
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,380
But it's strange.

209
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,980
Mr. Tan dislikes peach blossoms the most.

210
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,700
Why would he pick a peach blossom scent for me?

211
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
Take a sniff. Does it smell nice?

212
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,020
It really brings back old memories.

213
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,100
You seem to know exactly

214
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,300
what he likes or dislikes.

215
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,340
What old memories?

216
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,020
What are you talking about?

217
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,140
I saw it with my own eyes.

218
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,740
You and Mr. Tan

219
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,020
were in the perfume shop,

220
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,260
exchanging glances, being touchy-feely.

221
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,820
You followed me?

222
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,660
I...

223
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Who followed you?

224
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,700
I just happened to pass by.

225
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,940
If you're not doing anything wrong,
you have nothing to fear.

226
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,340
What wrong thing did I do?

227
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,060
It was the opening of the perfume shop.

228
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,860
We went there to try out and observe perfumes.

229
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
Come on.

230
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,060
Don't overreact.

231
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,340
I got rid of Cuiliu

232
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,180
for you.

233
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,580
Can't you consider me a little bit

234
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,780
and behave a little bit?

235
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
You got rid of Cuiliu for me?

236
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,660
You got rid of Cuiliu

237
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,940
because she's deceitful.

238
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,660
I get it now.

239
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,980
If it weren't for me,

240
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,660
you would have kept Cuiliu by your side

241
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,140
and behaved recklessly.

242
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,780
- It's not that.
- And also,

243
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,700
Mr. Tan hasn't done anything wrong.

244
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,140
Can he be compared to Cuiliu?

245
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,500
Okay, let's stop arguing.

246
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm here for something important.

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,860
Sit down.

248
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,180
Today, I went to the perfume shop,

249
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,220
and inspiration struck.

250
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,460
I was thinking, women love two things the most.

251
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,460
One is accessories,

252
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,380
and the other is perfume.

253
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,780
If we combine the two,

254
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,340
wouldn't they sell like hotcakes?

255
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,380
Perfume and jade?

256
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,340
If our jade emits fragrance,

257
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,060
wherever the wearer goes,

258
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,660
butterflies and bees will be drawn to them.

259
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,540
We'll surely expand our market.

260
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,500
And I've researched this.

261
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,940
Mr. Tan has something

262
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,140
called an aroma stone.

263
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,300
Even stones and crystals can carry fragrance.

264
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,500
Our jade should have no problem.

265
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,260
As long as we work hard,

266
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,180
we can surely surpass Su Jue.

267
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,020
Stop.

268
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,980
I will never cooperate with him.

269
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,780
Why are you

270
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
so narrow-minded?

271
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,940
Enough talk.

272
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,620
It's getting late outside.

273
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,060
I'm going to stroll around Flower Pavilion.

274
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,420
Sleep early.

275
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,740
Hold on.

276
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,500
Where are you going?

277
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,340
For a walk.

278
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,420
Alright.

279
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,540
Let me tell you, even without you,

280
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,700
I can handle it myself.

281
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,660
What nonsense did Liu come up with?

282
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,980
(The Jade Competition has dealt
a heavy blow to the Pei family.)

283
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,820
(If broken jade jewelry
cuts off the Pei family's way out,)

284
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,020
(the Pei family will be at their wits' end.)

285
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,340
(Will they use the Crown then?)

286
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,500
Young Master, why are you here?

287
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,740
I'm angry.

288
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,980
Then don't get angry. It's bad for your health.

289
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,740
Don't you want to ask me why I'm angry?

290
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,260
Why are you angry then?

291
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,660
I...

292
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,100
Since you don't want to say,

293
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,420
I won't ask further.

294
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
I'm the young master of Suyu Pavilion.

295
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,580
I usually remain calm and composed,

296
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,100
but now I've been pushed

297
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,140
to such heartache by a woman.

298
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,940
Young Master, I have never pushed you.

299
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Yes.

300
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,340
It's my own doing, okay?

301
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,180
I saw you embracing Mr. Tan,

302
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,020
being all lovey-dovey.

303
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm jealous, resentful, and envious.

304
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,940
Is that okay?

305
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,620
I've been decisive in all my life,

306
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,740
but now I'm so embarrassed like this.

307
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,660
Young Master, you've misunderstood.

308
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,700
Mr. Tan is Dandan's old friend.

309
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,980
We just met by chance.

310
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,940
It's not what you think.

311
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,700
You...

312
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
You're explaining to me.

313
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,900
You still care about me, right?

314
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,700
I haven't finished talking yet.

315
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,300
Even if I really have something with him,

316
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,300
you're just my master.

317
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,140
You don't have to be angry.

318
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,780
Unless their family is on the verge of ruin,

319
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,340
desperate and unable to make ends meet,

320
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,540
then maybe they would

321
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,700
sell off the amber from the Crown.

322
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,940
Young Master,

323
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,460
I have something to discuss with you.

324
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,300
Qipei Pavilion has been developing
low-cost broken jade jewelry recently.

325
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,580
In fact, I had this idea earlier.

326
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,700
Qipei Pavilion has lost the competition.

327
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,620
Their reputation is damaged.

328
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,740
Their high-priced jade business
has taken a big hit.

329
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,100
If we seize the opportunity now

330
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
and release low-cost jewelry first,

331
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,780
won't they be at their wits' end?

332
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,940
I don't agree.

333
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,580
Fine.

334
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,820
Fine?

335
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,980
That's it?

336
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,980
Will it kill you to beg me once?

337
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,220
Since you think it's unnecessary,

338
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,180
there's no point in discussing it further.

339
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,820
Did you really have nothing with Mr. Tan,

340
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,660
like you said?

341
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,860
It's true.

342
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,540
About the jewelry you mentioned earlier,

343
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,180
I'll have people start production tomorrow.

344
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,660
(Delight and Peace)

345
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
Wow.

346
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,540
These sample designs
are indeed exquisite and fresh.

347
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,260
I didn't expect you, so young,

348
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,460
to have such talent.

349
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,180
Yes. Though these
jewelry pieces aren't expensive,

350
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,220
they will definitely sell out after release.

351
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh, stop it.

352
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,060
Thanks to your craftsmanship.

353
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,260
Only when you make them well

354
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,740
can they be sold well.

355
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,180
Young Master,

356
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,500
do we really need to make nice?

357
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,900
This isn't making nice.

358
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,740
This is me being magnanimous and broad-minded.

359
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,020
No need to be on the same level as her.

360
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,620
Besides,

361
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,700
she hasn't mentioned

362
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,780
that fragrant jewelry to me in days.

363
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,220
I can't keep fixating on one thing.

364
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,420
Peach blossom cakes, peach blossom pastries,

365
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,580
and chilled peach blossom hawthorn.

366
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,460
Why all peach blossoms?

367
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,660
Don't you remember?

368
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,380
What did that ugly painter give her back then?

369
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,780
Peach blossom scented powder.

370
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,940
Understood.

371
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,900
Understood, understood.

372
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,380
After eating my peach blossom pastry,

373
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,180
your peach blossom romance will stop.

374
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,460
Ms. Dandan.

375
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,420
Shopkeeper Hao.

376
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,420
70% of the broken jade jewelry
has been completed in production.

377
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,700
We'll start arranging for them
to be shelved in two days.

378
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,220
Regarding these newly arrived styles,

379
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,100
we also need to hurry up.

380
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,620
If the interval is too long,
it might affect sales.

381
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,300
Rest assured. I'm here
keeping a close eye day and night.

382
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,340
We'll be ready to ship out soon.

383
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,340
I'll go take a look.

384
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,380
Dandan.

385
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,700
This is for you...

386
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,020
Ms. Dandan, Mr. Tan is here looking for you.

387
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,140
He said it was pre-arranged earlier.

388
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
I... This...

389
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,020
Let's go.

390
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,700
I often hear Ms. Dandan mentioning you.

391
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,540
Today, it's an honor to meet you.

392
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,940
Madam, your words are too kind.

393
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,900
You are the pillar of the community,
a role model for all of us.

394
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,620
Madam.

395
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,260
- Mother.
- Pei.

396
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
Madam.

397
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,660
Mr. Tan has recently opened a perfume shop.

398
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,780
Both its revenue and quality

399
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
are among the best in the city.

400
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,100
I invited Mr. Tan over today

401
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,060
mainly to integrate his fragrances

402
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,620
with our jade accessories.

403
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,180
Madam, think about it.

404
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,420
If our accessories and jade products

405
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,740
emit fragrances,

406
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,300
wouldn't they be unique

407
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,420
and unparalleled in the world?

408
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,940
Madam,

409
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,940
I wanted to discuss this with the young master.

410
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,060
But the young master

411
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,580
is jealous of Mr. Tan's beauty.

412
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,460
Without any justification, he refused me.

413
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,420
So I had to...

414
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,260
Stay calm, stay calm.

415
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,740
I had to come to you.

416
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,620
Is it feasible to apply fragrance

417
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,420
to jade?

418
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
I've been developing many new types
of fragrances recently.

419
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,340
I speculate that whether it's fumigating,
soaking the jade,

420
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,220
or applying fragrances

421
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,580
in the form of patches or dots,

422
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,380
- Don't be angry.
- all can be tried.

423
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,500
And as for the lingering time of the fragrance?

424
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,980
As long as the oils are chosen well,

425
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
and the attachments are appropriate,

426
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,620
the fragrance should last
for at least six months.

427
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,020
Madam,

428
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,540
we can also work with Mr. Tan's perfume shop.

429
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,660
Once this fragrance stops,

430
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,860
we offer lifetime free refills.

431
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,620
Of course,

432
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,500
this cost must be calculated
at the time of initial sale.

433
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,660
In this way, our two families
can cooperate for a long time.

434
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,420
I think this is feasible.

435
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,820
Dandan always thinks long-term.

436
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,140
Thank you, Madam.

437
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,180
It's fate for Madam Pei and Dandan

438
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,180
to get to know each other.

439
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,580
It's your mutual blessings.

440
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,620
Yes, that's right.

441
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,460
It's our mutual blessings.

442
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,060
It's my blessing.

443
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,100
I disagree with this matter.

444
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Why are you here causing trouble?

445
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,500
Why do you disagree?

446
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,980
It's true we lost in the Jade Competition,

447
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,340
but now

448
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,300
we have broken jade jewelry

449
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,100
and fragrant jewelry,

450
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,060
playing some small

451
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,180
and unrefined tricks.

452
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,940
When Qipei Pavilion was established,

453
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,820
it was for the refinement of jade carving.

454
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,780
If the ancestors knew

455
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,860
today's Qipei Pavilion is in this situation,

456
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,300
what would they think?

457
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,420
Madam,

458
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,780
no matter what industry it is,

459
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,300
we must let the common people

460
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,820
enjoy the benefits we provide.

461
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,620
If we just hold onto those empty ideals,

462
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,380
aren't we just admiring ourselves in isolation

463
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,340
and deceiving ourselves and others?

464
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,420
I won't let you

465
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,380
and that ugly painter get your way.

466
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,740
You are the ugliest one.

467
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Madam, Young Master.

468
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,340
The City Lord urgently summons
the young master to an audience.

469
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,980
Me?

470
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,260
(Xuanzheng Hall, Yuncui City)

471
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,740
(Xuanzheng Hall)

472
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,860
Greetings, Your Lordship.

473
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,060
No need for formalities.

474
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,060
Look at those jade pieces first.

475
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,220
These jade pieces emit a special fragrance.

476
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,380
Right.

477
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,940
This is the new fragrant jade jewelry
launched by Xiushui City.

478
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,180
Fragrant jade jewelry?

479
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,540
Xiushui City also produces jade,

480
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,860
but the jade material is rough,
and the techniques are ordinary.

481
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,300
It's been trampled underfoot
by the Yuncui City for decades.

482
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,300
Now I don't know where they got the idea.

483
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,220
They've produced so much
fragrant jade jewelry,

484
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,100
attracting merchants
from all over the country to buy.

485
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,300
Our Yuncui City,

486
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,300
boasting the reputation of the No. 1 Jade City,

487
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,700
seems to be about to be ignored.

488
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,180
So, you summoned us here

489
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,260
to urge us to expedite the production
of fragrant jade jewelry

490
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,500
to strike at Xiushui City?

491
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,500
That's right.

492
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,340
I order you to produce better goods

493
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,700
in the shortest time possible,

494
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,780
whether it's the quality
of the fragrance or the jade jewelry,

495
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,060
double theirs.

496
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,060
Today, I went to the perfume shop,

497
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,700
and inspiration struck.

498
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,380
I was thinking, women love two things the most.

499
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,500
One is accessories,

500
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
and the other is perfume.

501
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,780
If we combine the two,

502
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,420
wouldn't they sell like hotcakes?

503
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,580
His Lordship

504
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
has planned this for a long time.

505
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,460
Under his efforts and guidance,

506
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,180
Yuncui City's fragrance merchants
are passionate now,

507
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,420
and their quality and standards
have been qualitatively improved.

508
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,380
I believe they will also support your work.

509
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,980
Your Lordship,

510
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,900
I can make fragrant jade jewelry,

511
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,740
and I won't let you down.

512
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,420
But the loser of the Jade Competition,

513
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,980
with their penchant for plagiarism,

514
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,020
doesn't have to work with us.

515
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,020
Alright.

516
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,740
This concerns the reputation
and future of Yuncui City.

517
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,260
Let's not turn on each other.

518
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,340
Qipei Pavilion is still a century-old brand.

519
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,820
With one more person helping,

520
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,380
I can be a bit more at ease.

521
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,980
Yes.

522
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,060
Pei Pei.

523
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,420
During this period,

524
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,300
you should communicate closely with Su Jue,

525
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,340
cooperate sincerely,

526
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,220
achieve results, and make contributions.

527
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,820
As for the plagiarism incident before,

528
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,700
His Lordship won't pursue it further.

529
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,260
Fragrant jade jewelry is of utmost importance.

530
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,660
The Pei family will spare no effort.

531
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,020
However, regarding this plagiarism matter,

532
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,820
I believe the innocent
will prove their innocence.

533
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,220
Alright. Hurry and get to work.

534
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,620
What are you laughing at?

535
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,940
Laughing at your foolishness.

536
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,860
Officially appointed by the City Lord's decree,

537
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,180
you have to do it now.

538
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,820
If only you had listened to me earlier,

539
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,860
we would've saved all this trouble now, right?

540
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,380
Yes.

541
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,900
It seems you truly are favored by heaven.

542
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,420
With you around,

543
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,300
everything goes smoothly.

544
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,940
Aren't you afraid

545
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,620
I'll get too close to that ugly painter?

546
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,980
Now my horizons have broadened.

547
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,900
Mr. Tan and I

548
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,220
are just regular friends.

549
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,700
Since the City Lord has tasked us

550
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,260
with developing fragrant jade jewelry,

551
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,980
we should set aside our suspicions

552
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,820
and double our efforts.

553
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,580
Perhaps this is our chance for a turnaround.

554

♪Who is the joy and sorrow for♪

555

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,110

562
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,660
Do you think I am

563
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,620
an ordinary little genius?

564
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,020
Yes, yes, yes.

565
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,460
Your random idea

566
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,100
turns out to be crucial
for Yuncui City's rescue.

567
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,500
Even the City Lord is worried now.

568
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,540
You know.

569
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,100
If we had thought of it earlier,

570
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,420
they wouldn't have any chances now.

571
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,500
Exactly.

572
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,500
So, Qipei Pavilion's renewed glory

573
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,980
depends on the two of us.

574
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,180
We're the little geniuses.

575
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,660
I'll pour the wine for the genius.

576
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,140
Go ahead.

577
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,220
The City Lord ordered us
to develop new products.

578
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,980
It's beneficial for us without any harm.

579
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,460
But working with Qipei Pavilion

580
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,100
is truly distasteful.

581
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,580
It sounds like cooperation,

582
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,140
but it's just another round of competition.

583
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,500
That day at Tan's Perfume Shop,

584
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,660
I overheard Dandan mentioning
the combination of fragrance and jade.

585
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,700
If the City Lord favors this idea so much,

586
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,580
Qipei Pavilion must have
well-thought-out plans.

587
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,660
Rest assured.

588
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,540
I won't let them steal the limelight.

589
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,460
Now, Tan's Perfume Shop

590
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,580
is the leader in perfume shops.

591
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,060
Since you know the owner,

592
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
why not discuss cooperation

593
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,580
and gain some unique techniques from him?

594
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,820
No need.

595
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,380
I'll handle it myself.

596
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,340
Alright then.

597
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,980
Rest up early.

598
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,180
Young Master, I'll take my leave.

599
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,060
Shuangshuang,

600
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,900
after careful consideration,

601
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,100
it seems there's nothing inappropriate

602
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
between you and Mr. Tan.

603
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,260
Sorry about earlier.

604
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,180
Young Master, that's too serious.

605
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,740
I didn't mind at all.

606
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,980
Mr. Pei,

607
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,660
you're 15 minutes late.

608
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,180
Has the Qipei Pavilion always been so slack

609
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,420
and had no idea about punctuality?

610
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,500
Being slack is because of I'm working with you.

611
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,740
Likewise.

612
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,100
- Speak.
- The City Lord's cooperation

613
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,700
just means developing fragrant jade jewelry.

614
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,780
As I see it,

615
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,180
let's each develop our own.

616
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,060
We can compile our results in the end

617
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,300
and present them directly to him.

618
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,260
There's no need to sit here and discuss it.

619
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
That would be great.

620
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,580
It's rare for us to agree on something.

621
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,820
You better get to work quickly.

622
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,140
Don't let the City Lord blame me later

623
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,940
for being condescending, arrogant,

624
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,260
and lacking in cooperation spirit.

625
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,180
You should worry more about yourself.

626
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,060
Is that so?

627
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
I've already discussed with Mr. Tan

628
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,220
and obtained his top-selling 12 fragrances,

629
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,900
like epiphyllum and peonies.

630
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,820
Shuangshuang used her skilled golden thread

631
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,340
to combine these fragrances

632
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,500
with 12 zodiac-themed jade pendants.

633
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,380
It's vivid and fragrant.

634
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,420
Once it's launched,
it's likely to sell out quickly.

635
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,940
What about you?

636
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,820
Well.

637
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,300
Mr. Tan indeed has some skills.

638
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,420
His fragrance-making technique

639
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,580
is unmatched by other stores.

640
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,260
Speaking of which,

641
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,360
are you still upset

642
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,260
because of his special relationship

643
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,580
with Dandan?

644
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,260
Is that why you haven't started it?

645
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,260
Dandan has nothing to do with him.

646
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,780
That's for the best.

647
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,780
Shuangshuang just met him by chance.

648
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,340
Put away your fragrant sachet
and jade pendant.

649
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,340
Dandan is downstairs waiting to take me home.

650
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,380
Goodbye.

651
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,380
You...

652
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,300
Just taking you home.
What's there to show off?

653
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,900
What are you doing?

654
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,740
Candid haws.

655
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,610
You eat.

656
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,980
I bought it especially for you.

657
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,260
In broad daylight,

658
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,220
this is really ominous.

659
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,740
That's because you have an ominous eye.

660
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
How about you have a bite too?

661
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,100
No need.

662
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,180
Seeing you two eat is enough.

663
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

664
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,620
Why didn't you follow me inside just now?

665
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Why go in?

666
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,420
To watch him show off?

667
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
You really understand him.

668
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,340
"Know yourself and your enemy,
and you will know no peril."

669
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,300
Su Jue has already talked

670
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,140
with your ugly painter.

671
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,020
They've produced fragrant sachets
and jade pendants.

672
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,020
We should hurry too

673
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,180
to present something to the City Lord.

674
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,780
Alright, Young Master.

675
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,140
We've agreed.

676
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,540
I won't negotiate with that ugly painter.

677
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,940
Young Master, if that's what you want.

678
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,340
(Zhang's Fabric Shop)

679
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,500
You're awake.

680
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
I've figured something out.

681
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,860
Didn't sleep at all last night, did you?

682
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,100
It doesn't matter.

683
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,300
The material of this jade is too dense.

684
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
It simply can't retain fragrance.

685
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,620
You've tried

686
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,540
steaming, soaking, and baking it,

687
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,500
but nothing works.

688
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,020
If we do it like Suyu Pavilion,

689
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,580
simply place a fragrant object on top,

690
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,740
it would be too cluttered.

691
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
What's this?

692
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Limestone.

693
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,460
Limestone is sparse and porous.

694
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,140
It's perfect for retaining fragrance.

695
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,220
We can polish it into thin slices

696
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,180
and stick it on the inner walls.

697
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,140
It won't affect the aesthetics
and will still have fragrance.

698
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,100
You really are clever.

699
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,340
Did you make this after having this idea?

700
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,780
And I was thinking,

701
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,740
for men's jade, simplicity is key.

702
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,460
We can use the veneer technique.

703
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,220
For women's accessories,
they tend to be more ornate.

704
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,700
We can use ribbons, silk, and tying.

705
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,580
These are still useful.

706
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,420
What are you doing?

707
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,580
Hurry up and praise me.

708
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,900
Of course.

709
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,100
You really are an ordinary little genius.

710
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,500
But the color of this limestone is too dull.

711
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
If we could switch

712
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,900
to Dongling stone,
which blends better with jade,

713
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,020
the effect would be even better.

714
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,860
You know these matters better than I do.

715
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,780
I'll listen to you.

716
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,380
Suyu Pavilion has already started selling

717
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,740
its fragrant sachets and jade pendants.

718
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,220
We can't lag behind either.

719
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,580
Let's have the craftsmen

720
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,580
rush out dozens of them

721
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
and start pre-sales tomorrow.

722
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,780
Then let's go inform Shopkeeper Hao.

723
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,100
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

724
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,980
Mr. Hao, we can push forward
with our fragrant jade bracelets.

725
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,460
What's going on?

726
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,700
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

727
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,020
Fragrant jade bracelets?

728
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,940
Forget about them now.

729
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,540
Look at what mess you've made.

730
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,220
Our broken jade ornaments

731
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,700
are all here.

732
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,060
Not a single one sold.

733
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,340
How could this happen?

734
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,220
It's impossible.

735
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,860
The day before yesterday,
Suyu Pavilion suddenly started selling

736
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,740
low-priced broken jade ornaments
just like ours.

737
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,100
Their craftsmanship is finer than ours,

738
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,300
and their prices are lower.

739
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,780
(Just like ours?)

740
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,380
What's more, they played their trump card,

741
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,260
claiming that it was designed by Mr. Su Jue

742
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,020
to benefit low-income people.

743
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,860
Suyu Pavilion has a bigger reputation than us.

744
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,420
Who would buy the same thing from us,

745
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,860
especially two days late?

746
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,260
Not only are we losing money,
but we're also being accused

747
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,100
of copying and being shameless.

748
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,540
These scraps with many flaws and defects

749
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,900
are troublesome to carve

750
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,020
and time-consuming to produce.

751
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,700
We've made so many.

752
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,860
We can't sell this pile of junk,

753
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,940
leaving us with a mess.

754
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,300
Is the loss significant?

755
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,260
If this were before,

756
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,140
this amount of money wouldn't matter.

757
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,060
But after the Jade Competition,

758
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,980
our high-priced jade sales weren't doing well.

759
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,300
Now we've used up a large part of our savings

760
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,100
to make these.

761
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,300
What can I say?

762
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,420
How could it be such a coincidence?

763
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,460
(Suyu Pavilion)

764
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,380
Dandan.

765
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,660
Why are you here?

766
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,580
Shuangshuang, I want to ask you.

767
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,740
Why is Suyu Pavilion
selling low-priced jewelry?

768
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,900
How would they know these things?

769
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,740
When I was an apprentice,

770
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,580
I once made a batch of low-priced ornaments

771
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,020
that sat untouched in a corner.

772
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,700
I don't know

773
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,420
why they suddenly decided
to produce and sell them.

774
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,580
I only found out this morning too.

775
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,140
But

776
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,460
they're saying they were made by Su Jue.

777
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,220
He's famous.

778
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,700
His reputation

779
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,940
would boost sales.

780
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,700
I knew it.

781
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,900
My skills are limited.

782
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,500
(Suyu Pavilion)
The jewelry Suyu Pavilion is selling

783
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,180
is somewhat similar

784
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,300
to the sketches I gave you before.

785
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,740
Will this have a big impact

786
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,100
on Qipei Pavilion?

787
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,220
After the Jade Competition,

788
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,900
Qipei Pavilion's reputation
was seriously affected

789
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,380
and we've been eating on our old savings.

790
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,780
We had been thinking

791
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,420
about coming up with a new plan,

792
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,700
but unexpectedly,

793
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,580
we've been overtaken by you.

794
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,620
We can't sell anything now.

795
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,380
How should I try

796
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,420
to make up for the losses?

797
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,220
Shuangshuang, I have things to do.

798
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,260
I'll leave now.

799
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,460
(Dandan, wait for me.)

800
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,540
