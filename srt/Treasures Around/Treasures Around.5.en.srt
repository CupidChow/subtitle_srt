(Su's Mansion)

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,780
What are you doing?

25
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,300
Young Master.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,820
This is pear incense,

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,700
which can calme the mind and aid sleep.

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,860
I noticed that
you haven't been looking well,

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,660
so I intended
to give it to you in person,

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,100
but you weren't in the room.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
So I thought I'd wait for you here.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,220
Sorry.

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,940
I was too harsh just now.

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,220
It's my fault.

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,580
I shouldn't have entered your room
without permission.

36
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,460
It's okay.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,580
I misunderstood you.

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,820
I promise

39
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,340
I won't do this again in the future.

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,580
In that case,

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,380
you should rest earlier.

42
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,620
Good news.

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,700
The black market goods
were retrieved from the government.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,060
But for pulling strings

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,500
plus the losses along the way,

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,580
it cost us more than five thousand.

47
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,780
Darn Pei Pei.

48
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,780
He did this first to me.

49
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,300
This kind of comfortable life

50
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,580
can't be lived by just us.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,900
Uncle.

52
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,140
Did the person
arranged yesterday go over?

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,420
Yes.

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,500
- Well...
- Well...

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
- You go ahead.
- You go ahead.

56
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,140
Yesterday,

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,460
you were drunk.

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,460
Yes,

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,780
I was drunk.

60
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,620
Have some porridge to sober up.

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,140
Wait a moment.

62
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,380
I was not completely drunk.

63
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,900
I...

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,580
Young Master.

65
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,300
Young Master.

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,900
Bad news, Young Master.

67
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,380
Stop talking.

68
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,900
Hurry up and pay us back.

69
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,540
Your Pei family is in trouble.

70
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,420
Don't take me down as well.

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,340
That's right.

72
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,620
Please remain calm.

73
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,540
May I ask where you heard

74
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,020
the funding for my Qipei Pavilion
is about to be cut off?

75
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,020
Of course, from a more prestigious place

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,780
than Qipei Pavilion.

77
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,500
Is your Pei family

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,020
really out of money?

79
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,220
Nonsense.

80
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,300
Everyone,

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,460
we have been cooperating
for many years, right?

82
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,340
When have we ever failed to pay on time?

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,620
After hearing some rumors,

84
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,100
you came to cause trouble.

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,620
Aren't you afraid
of damaging our relationship?

86
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,020
Only those with weaknesses
are susceptible to evil influences.

87
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,900
Since there is no issue,

88
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,100
just pay us back.

89
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,180
Yes.

90
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,980
What are you doing?

91
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,180
The repayment time

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,500
is clearly written on the contract.

93
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,180
Isn't that absurd

94
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,140
to ask for money ahead of time?

95
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,780
The contract was signed

96
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,860
when you still had power.

97
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,220
Now how would I know

98
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,420
if you still have any strength?

99
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,700
- You...
- Just so you know,

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,940
if your business
is as big as Suyu Pavilion's,

101
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
we wouldn't have believed the rumors.

102
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,040
- Yes.
- Exactly.

103
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,820
Madam.

104
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,620
What should we do?

105
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,540
The finished jade products
have not been sold out yet.

106
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,620
We don't have that much cash
on hand right now.

107
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,860
Don't forget

108
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,180
you used the house as collateral.

109
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,140
If you can't come up
with the money today,

110
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,140
we won't be polite.

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,070
Everyone.

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,980
I have been in this industry
for thirty years.

113
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,660
Doing business

114
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,100
emphasizes integrity

115
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,380
and following the rules.

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,700
If I give you the money today,

117
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,900
that's breaking the rules.

118
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,700
So today,

119
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,780
you won't take any money from me,

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,780
but you can take my life

121
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,940
if you want.

122
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,770
You...

123
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,580
- This is unreasonable!
- What do you want?

124
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,300
Madam, Madam.

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,940
Madam.

126
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,460
Who is this?

127
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,500
So many people.

128
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,180
Madam, I have saved enough money

129
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,540
to buy my own dowry.

130
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,540
Sorry for this.

131
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,660
This is a maid from our mansion.

132
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,700
This maid is surprisingly rich.

133
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,740
What?

134
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,180
Do you think I stole these?

135
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,340
Let me tell you.

136
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,980
Madam Pei Qin is here.

137
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,380
Don't slander me.

138
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,140
Our paycheck is settled

139
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,900
on a fifteen-month basis.

140
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,860
There are bonuses
for festivals and holidays.

141
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,900
In less than half a year,

142
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,940
I have saved so much.

143
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Even a servant has so much money.

144
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,100
It shows that the Pei family
is not short on money.

145
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,700
Exactly, just ask her for it.

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,700
Why don't you settle the bill for us?

147
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,220
Yes, settle it for us.

148
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Are you the suppliers
to collect payment?

149
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,140
That's right.

150
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,940
Have you signed a contract

151
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,660
recognized by the government?

152
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,900
Of course.

153
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,180
Is the payment due?

154
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,060
Well,

155
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,900
not really.

156
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
Look.

157
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,420
Even I, a maid, know that.

158
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,700
This is neither reasonable nor legal.

159
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,660
If all merchants were like you,

160
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,860
ignoring the government
and the contract,

161
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
making a scene in others' shop,

162
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,860
how can people still do business?

163
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,380
Our madam

164
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,740
is respected and esteemed.

165
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,780
She won't allow you to do such things.

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,900
Do you think we want it this way?

167
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,020
It's because your family is out of money.

168
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,340
Out of money?

169
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,820
Well,

170
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,420
who told you that?

171
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,140
For such a vulgar person like me,

172
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,420
if the Pei family doesn't have money,

173
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,620
I would have left a long time ago.

174
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,220
That's right.

175
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,460
How about this?

176
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,500
I'll give you my wages.

177
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,060
Anyway, I'm not in a hurry
to get married.

178
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,900
Otherwise,

179
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,980
you can go talk with the officials.

180
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,340
If Qipei Pavilion
really doesn't have money,

181
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,060
I've already made plans.

182
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,940
I heard that the imperial city

183
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,260
issued new terms for sale contracts.

184
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,180
It will soon be applied in Yuncui City.

185
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,260
I heard for unjustified
contract termination,

186
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,620
they will be strictly punished.

187
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,020
So you guys

188
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,180
better be careful.

189
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,900
Go ahead.

190
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
Well...

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,420
Since Qipei Pavilion is not in danger,

192
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,900
- That's right, that's right.
- we will take our leave first.

193
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,500
We will take our leave first.

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,340
Go, go, go.

195
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,860
- I'll come back on the payment date.
- Right.

196
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,700
Remember.

197
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,690
Go.

198
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,180
Okay, then I won't see you off.

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,340
Let's talk about it another day.

200
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,700
Are the new terms

201
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,740
that you said true?

202
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
Of course not.

203
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,940
I was just kidding them.

204
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,380
If we're really out of money,

205
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,260
we can get rid of them first

206
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,740
and then come up with a plan.

207
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,340
Where did this come from?

208
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,980
The secret money
under Young Master's bed.

209
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,020
Young Master.

210
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,620
I'll return it in a while.

211
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,580
Smart as I am.

212
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,660
I was also anxious.

213
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,100
(Peace and Tranquility)

214
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm Shan Dandan.

215
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,460
I understand you.

Young Master, time for the meal.

231
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,180
Time to eat, Young Master.

232
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,060
Time to eat.

233
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,260
Wait a moment.

234
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,660
Today you look different.

235
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,340
Your hair is styled

236
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,540
and your outfit is changed.

237
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,900
Nice.

238
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,820
Young Master, please enjoy.

239
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,980
I'm going out to eat too.

240
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,140
- Take me with you.
- Wait a moment.

241
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,980
Let's go.

242
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,980
You two

243
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,660
stay and eat with me.

244
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,060
This doesn't seem appropriate.

245
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,500
What's wrong with that?

246
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,580
You're considered my family.

247
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,300
What's wrong with eating with me?

248
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,540
Sit.

249
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,180
- Okay then.
- Okay then.

250
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,060
Come on.

251
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
Young Master.

252
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,940
I noticed you've changed a bit today.

253
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,620
Where have I changed?

254
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,900
Hard to tell.

255
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
But maybe

256
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,620
you've become
more gentle and considerate.

257
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Am I still gentle and considerate now?

258
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,140
No, Young Master.

259
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,500
You haven't changed at all.

260
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,300
You haven't changed at all.

261
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,900
Okay, hurry up and eat.

262
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,040
You won't have this treatment later.

263
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,380
Actually, today I

264
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,860
need to announce something.

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,540
What's the matter?

266
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,100
What is it?

267
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,820
(Surrounded by auspicious clouds)
The design for the Jade Competition.

268
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,780
What?

269
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,380
The design for the Jade Competition.

270
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,220
You will participate
in the competition with me?

271
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,780
Yes.

272
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,660
Really?

273
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,580
Pinch me.

274
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,300
Great!

275
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,420
Great!

276
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,660
Alright. Isn't it too much?

277
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,220
Hurry up and eat.

278
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,320
Then you'll have the energy to work.

279
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes, sir.

280
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,340
Hurry up and eat.

281
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,180
I'll put it away first.

282
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
Let's eat.

283
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,660
Young Master, I'm so anxious.

284
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,460
I got it.

285
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,260
- You got what?
- You got what?

286
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,980
Young Master.

287
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,460
Can I do this?

288
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,380
What's wrong with that?

289
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,980
Most people are right-handed.

290
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
You can't just switch hand, can you?

291
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,300
Are you an ordinary person?

292
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,780
No, you're not.

293
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,260
You are a genius.

294
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,300
You are the chosen one.

295
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,180
Right?

296
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,180
Let me tell you.

297
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,260
As long as you practice diligently,

298
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,220
I believe

299
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,620
you can definitely make it.

300
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,900
Although

301
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,540
I don't understand art at all,

302
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,100
I think having taste and talent

303
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
is more important than rigid techniques.

304
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,900
The old craftsmen in our mansion

305
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,140
are all over fifty years old.

306
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,900
The Pei family can only rely on you now.

307
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,060
Young Master, here.

308
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,300
Come on.

309
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,020
Come on. Come on.

310
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,220
It's okay. One more time.

311
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,180
Again.

312
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,900
Come on.

313
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Go for it.

314
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,420
Young Master, you made it.

315
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,180
Keep going.

316
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,100
Come on.

317
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,300
Use only your left hand
to pull the bow with 70% strength.

318
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,500
- Hold it for half an hour.
- Young Master, keep it up!

319
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,180
Ten.

320
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,420
Nine.

321
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,580
Eight.

322
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,580
Seven.

323
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,740
Six.

324
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,780
Five.

325
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,820
Four.

326
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,860
Three.

327
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,730
Two.

328
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,580
One.

329
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Take a break.

330
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,060
Okay, come on.

331
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,620
Come on.

332
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,620
The so-called finishing touch

333
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,140
is the eyes of the mandarin duck.

334
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,180
Wait a moment, Mr. Su.

335
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,260
What's up?

336
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,420
All things in the world
have their mates,

337
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,740
but people only envy mandarin ducks.

338
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,300
I think besides that
mandarin ducks represent love,

339
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
their beautiful appearance

340
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,820
is also eye-catching.

341
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,780
You mean...

342
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,060
What if mandarin ducks cannot see
the appearance of their partners,

343
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,380
but still choose
to grow old with each other?

344
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,620
No eyes?

345
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,940
Wonderful.

346
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,940
It's really wonderful.

347
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Two blind mandarin ducks

348
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,700
still cuddling together.

349
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,140
Ingenious and interesting.

350
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,980
Yes.

351
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,020
Right.

352
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,540
Shuangshuang, you're truly my muse.

353
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,060
Mr. Su, you flatter me.

354
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,780
Jue.

355
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,820
Sir.

356
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Pei Pei is going to participate
in the competition this year.

357
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,580
The old fox is watching him practice.

358
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,140
That's interesting.

359
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,100
That loser has also started to work hard.

360
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,340
Shuangshuang.

361
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,540
Let's go to the Pei's Mansion
to see the fun.

362
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,500
Mr. Su,

363
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,220
I've heard some bad rumors

364
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,420
about Suyu Pavilion.

365
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,100
I don't know if I should say it.

366
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,580
Tell me.

367
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Rumors say

368
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,780
the Moonlight Crown in the Pei family

369
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,780
was stolen by Su family.

370
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,260
What is your take on this?

371
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,340
I don't know.

372
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,180
The Su and Pei families
were equally prominent back then.

373
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,940
Once their treasure got lost,

374
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,900
naturally everyone thought it was us.

375
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,140
But there was another rumor back then.

376
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,500
I wonder if you know.

377
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,580
Young Master, please tell me.

378
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,260
It was an inside job of the Pei family.

379
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,340
How could it be?

380
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,140
This crown
was originally from their family.

381
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,700
This Moonlight Crown

382
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,620
was not exclusively crafted
by the Qipei Pavilion.

383
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,140
Though Pei Chufeng
is the chief designer,

384
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,220
many skilled craftsmen
have also contributed.

385
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,740
The Pei family was even dreaming to learn

386
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,860
some of its mysterious techniques.

387
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,880
Furthermore,

388
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,500
the water amber set in this crown

389
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,620
is a family heirloom of City Lord.

390
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,460
In order to please His Majesty,

391
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,620
he gave it to the Pei family
to embed it on the crown.

392
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,980
But it also disappeared.

393
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,980
What do you think is the reason?

394
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,500
Hold steady.

395
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,740
Hold steady.

396
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
- You made it!
- You made it!

397
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,500
You made it!

398
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,340
Congratulations, Young Master.

399
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,220
Done!

400
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,300
That's great, you succeeded.

401
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,990
Great!

402
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,900
Pei.

403
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,740
Good.

404
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,140
Good.

405
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,260
I knew

406
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,620
you could do it.

407
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,660
Although compared to the right hand,

408
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,780
it's not flexible and powerful enough.

409
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,740
As long as I focus and do it slowly,

410
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,420
I can use the left hand.

411
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,700
You've worked hard during this time.

412
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm going to cook today

413
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,820
and make delicious food

414
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,060
with everything I've learned.

415
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,700
Okay!

416
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,140
We're in for a treat!

417
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,180
Young Master, Young Master.

418
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,660
Suyu Pavilion requests a meeting.

419
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,340
Shuangshuang.

420
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,540
Shuangshuang.

421
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,140
You look nice.

422
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,780
Mr. Su.

423
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,860
Where is Madam Pei?

424
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,860
Suyu Pavilion's young master
visited in person.

425
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,940
Why doesn't she come to entertain us?

426
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,900
Young Master is the Pei family's master.

427
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,540
Speaking of it,
Ms. Dandan is quite funny.

428
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,180
Not long ago,
you were so disgusted with Pei Pei.

429
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,740
Now you look like a family.

430
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,180
Mr. Su is funnier.

431
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,140
Don't you know that people change?

432
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,100
You...

433
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,140
I advise you to be careful.

434
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,900
Don't follow the wrong master

435
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,340
and lose both your life and your money.

436
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,980
That's not for you to worry.

437
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,180
Take care of yourself.

438
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,380
Young Master is right.

439
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,540
You are overthinking.

440
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,220
Young Master,
I want to talk to my sister.

441
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,780
Shuangshuang.

442
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,900
Let's go.

443
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,580
I heard

444
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,220
you're participating

445
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
this Jade Competition personally.

446
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,220
Of course.

447
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,700
I will fight you to the end.

448
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,580
After so many years of being idle,

449
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,420
can you still wield the carving knife?

450
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
You will find out

451
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,180
when the time comes.

452
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,460
Let's wait and see.

453
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,980
Don't cry if you lose.

454
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,780
Shuangshuang, let me tell you.

455
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
I independently made an earpiece.

456
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,300
I showed it to Madam,

457
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,700
and she has been praising me,

458
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,740
saying I'm smart.

459
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,340
My sister is really clever.

460
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
It sounds like you're doing well now.

461
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,740
So you're going to prepare

462
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,540
for the Jade Competition with Mr. Pei.

463
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,740
This is the task Madam assigned to me.

464
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,420
Mr. Su also wants me
to participate in the design.

465
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,100
But it feels like

466
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,180
we're enemies.

467
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
How could it be?

468
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,220
It's just work.

469
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,100
We are inseparable sisters.

470
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,500
Shuangshuang.

471
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,660
Why don't you come to Qipei Pavilion?

472
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,100
What?

473
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,060
I'm telling you,
the people here are all very nice.

474
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,380
Even our Young Master

475
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,700
is different from what he used to be.

476
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,380
And Madam is extremely kind to me.

477
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,860
I think if I tell her,

478
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,020
there shouldn't be any problem.

479
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,820
But I owe Mr. Su a favor.

480
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,820
The competition is coming soon.

481
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,060
I...

482
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,740
That's right.

483
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,820
If you come over now,

484
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,220
he will definitely say that

485
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,060
I poach you.

486
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,460
Then you can come over
after the competition is over.

487
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,500
By the way, I made a hairpin for you.

488
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,220
Really? Why didn't you show it earlier?

489
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,060
Let me see.

490
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,420
The gold and silver inlay technique.

491
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,060
Young Master.

492
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,460
You know about this technique?

493
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,540
It's the technique used
on the crown back then.

494
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,750
I have a little knowledge about it.

495
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,260
By the way,

496
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,940
go to Mr. Hao
and ask for a few pieces of materials.

497
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,060
I'll give it a try first.

498
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,300
Okay.

499
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,660
Shuangshuang, I'll go get busy first.

500
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,260
Mr. Pei.

501
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,020
I wonder what techniques
you will use this time.

502
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,780
Hollow vertical carving.

503
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,340
And hairspring pinning.

504
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,700
Finished chatting?

505
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,580
Mr. Su, I have a favor to ask.

506
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,540
Go ahead.

507
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,060
There is my favorite steamed cake
near here.

508
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,820
I want to go buy some.

509
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,100
Can I have two hours off?

510
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,180
Of course.

511
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,500
I'll accompany you.

512
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,580
No need to bother.

513
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,060
I want to browse around by myself.

514
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,460
You can take the cart. I'll walk back.

515
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,340
No need, Mr. Su.

516
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,540
I can handle it myself.

517
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,740
Okay.

518
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,100
Be safe.

519
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,220
(Pei's Mansion)

520
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,860
Cheers!

521
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,260
Young Master,
you haven't lost your touch.

522
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,140
When you're in the competition,

523
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,660
you have to teach the people

524
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,820
from Suyu Pavilion a lesson.

525
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,670
That's right.

526
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,700
I just can't stand their arrogance.

527
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,500
Who was it back then?

528
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,140
For the good-looking

529
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,340
and talented young master

530
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,780
who were way out of my league,

531
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,620
she taught me a lesson.

532
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,700
Everyone has a time
when they are young and ignorant.

533
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,660
Let the past be the past.

534
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,380
Time is running out.

535
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
After choosing the style,

536
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,680
I'm going to start working on it.

537
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,380
Do you have any ideas?

538
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,740
I want to make the Linglong jade

539
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,780
that was broken back then.

540
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,100
(When Pei Chufeng passed away,)

541
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,740
(Pei Pei was still young.)

542
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,660
(How could he have mastered
so many skills on the crown?)

543
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,700
(Unless there is something left
for him to study.)

544
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,700
(Could it be that Su Jue is right?)

545
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,780
Linglong jade.

546
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,660
Ms. Dandan, someone wants to see you.

547
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,820
See me?

548
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,980
Yes.

549
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,260
(Tan Qinghe,
the No.1 Painter in Yuancui City)

550
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,180
Ms. Dandan.

551
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,500
Mr. Tan.

552
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,660
Young Master.

553
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,860
Is everything arranged properly?

554
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,900
Yes.

555
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,180
We can go directly in a while.

556
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,380
Young Master.

557
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,580
Young Master.

558
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,140
There is something I don't understand.

559
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,260
We only need one jade beauty.

560
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,260
Why do we need to make an appointment

561
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,280
with Ms. Lingyuan and Ms. Huadian?

562
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,860
You have to ask Suyu Pavilion.

563
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,140
They bribed Madam Yang,

564
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,100
and booked all the popular girls,

565
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,580
just to make other jade shops

566
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,420
hit a dead end.

567
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,940
This is shameless.

568
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,580
Young Master.

569
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,340
Will you sacrifice yourself

570
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,860
for the honey trap?

571
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,780
If you're really going to...

572
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,780
Well, Young Master,

573
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,420
do we need to ask Ms. Dandan

574
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,660
to come with us?

575
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,820
No.

576
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,500
She's a young girl.

577
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,820
It's inappropriate for her

578
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,860
to go to a brothel.

579
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
I thought

580
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,940
you're afraid that
Ms. Dandan will get jealous

581
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,580
seeing you sacrifice yourself.

582
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,660
What are you talking about?

583
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,900
I said, you...

584
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,620
Young Master, I think you are afraid
that Ms. Dandan will get jealous.

585
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,820
Stop.

586
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,900
I have a heavy workload recently.

587
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,300
I am thinking about
whether to ask you to come and help

588
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,180
to make some extra money.

589
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,500
Didn't expect that

590
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,660
you've become a jade appraiser.

591
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,660
Congratulations.

592
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,140
Okay, okay.

593
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,620
It's just an ordinary job.

594
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
What are you painting?

595
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,940
Let me see.

596
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
So beautiful!

597
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
Who is this?

598
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,060
These are the girls
from Flower Pavilion.

599
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,780
The Jade Competition is coming soon.

600
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,100
They are going to make the portraits
into a catalogue

601
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,860
and give it to major jade shops
for reference.

602
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,140
By that time,

603
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,640
jade appraisers
will collaborate with them

604
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,640
to display the jade products.

605
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,300
I see.

606
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,180
Although the popular girls
at Flower Pavilion

607
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,540
have already been reserved
by big clients like Suyu Pavilion,

608
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,180
the selection of the Jade Beauty
and the circulation of the catalog

609
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,980
are still important to them.

610
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,660
Why is it Suyu Pavilion again?

611
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,500
What's wrong with Suyu Pavilion?

612
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,700
Who is this?

613
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,100
This is Mr. Tan.

614
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,140
I used to work as an assistant
in his studio.

615
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,340
He is my former boss and good friend.

616
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,340
Nice to meet you.

617
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,100
Nice to meet you.

618
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,380
It's not necessary

619
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,660
to bring your former boss
to meet your current boss.

620
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,340
It's not like ex-husband
meeting current husband.

621
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,420
What do you think?

622
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,740
Listen to what you said.

623
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,700
You and your former boss

624
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,900
have quite an unusual relationship.

625
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,380
Why are you speaking
in such a strange way?

626
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,660
Where are you guys going?

627
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,740
To Flower Pavilion...

628
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,660
Flower Pavilion?

629
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,420
The nature of the beast.
Pei Pei just can't change.

630
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,580
Are you going to deliver this
to Flower Pavilion?

631
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,580
Yes.

632
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,100
See if they want me to modify

633
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,220
or redraw it.

634
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,620
Do they need to pay for modifications?

635
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,940
Of course.

636
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,460
I'll help you deliver.

637
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,900
I will take this money.

638
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,940
(Soughing of Pines)

639
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,660
Mr. Pei, can you help me choose one?

640
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,940
(Be Like Bamboo)
What do you think of me wearing this?

641
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,820
It's from you.

642
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,300
The peony is not so sweet
as the beauty's grace.

643
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,620
You look good in anything.

644
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,220
You

645
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,900
always use these sweet words
to make me happy.

646
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,460
Young Master.

647
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,140
Young Master, Young Master.

648
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,660
Something is wrong, Young Master.

649
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,500
There's a problem in the shop.
Hurry back and take a look.

650
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,420
Well,

651
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,140
what is it?

652
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,180
I promised Ms. Lingyuan

653
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,220
I'd spend the whole day with her.

654
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,500
What should I do?

655
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,980
Young Master,
I don't have time to explain.

656
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,180
Let's talk about it on the way back.

657
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,180
- Okay.
- Mr. Pei.

658
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,420
Aren't you asking me to

659
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,300
be the Jade Beauty for Qipei Pavilion?

660
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,180
Of course I want to.

661
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,540
But if I

662
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,060
offend Suyu Pavilion,

663
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,900
do you know
how many people I will offend?

664
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,620
You won't even help me
pick out a piece of jewelry.

665
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,580
This one looks really good on you.

666
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,420
It matches your outfit perfectly.

667
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,300
No, Huadian has this too.

668
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,860
What if we wear the same thing?

669
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
Can you help me choose again?

670
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,340
Young Master, we're running out of time.

671
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,580
- Let's go quickly.
- No. Let go.

672
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,220
- Let's go, Young Master.
- Don't.

673
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,500
Young Master, let's go.

674
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,020
Ms. Lingyuan.

675
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,060
Ms. Lingyuan.

676
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,540
You hurt me.

677
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,180
Sorry, my fault.

678
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,820
Your painting.

679
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,860
Looks great.

680
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,580
So, do you think she looks better

681
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,660
than in the painting?

682
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,980
Yeah. Yeah.

683
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,380
So you mean this portrait
doesn't look good.

684
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,540
I just went to Ms. Huadian's place.

685
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,460
She said she wants to
make major changes to this painting.

686
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,460
She wants to make her face look smaller

687
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,100
and the eyes bigger.

688
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,940
What?

689
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,700
She even wants to cheat in the painting.

690
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,260
Where else does she want to change?

691
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,500
- Just the color of the clothes.
- Let's go.

692
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,260
Make it look more ethereal.

693
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,820
It's driving me crazy.

694
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,900
Shameless!

695
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,820
OK, OK, OK.

696
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,740
Calm down, calm down.

697
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,060
Dandan, sit.

698
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,940
Well,

699
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,540
ask Mr. Tan to help me
make some changes too.

700
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,260
Here, here.

701
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,300
Also, make the dress a little more red.

702
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,460
She wants to look gentle.

703
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,140
I'll make myself more eye-catching.

704
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,020
Let's see which of us men will like.

705
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,900
There's no time left.

706
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,260
Is there still time now?

707
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,660
Yes, leave it to me.

708
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,460
About Huadian...

709
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,740
Don't worry. You're our priority.

710
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,380
There won't be any time left for her.

711
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
Here.

712
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,420
Oh no.

713
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,340
Young Master.

714
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,940
The time you arranged
with Ms. Huadian is almost up.

715
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,060
Let's go quickly.

716
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,340
So why did you schedule
to meet them at the same time?

717
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,780
What if they run into each other?

718
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,380
You don't know how scary it is
when a woman gets jealous.

719
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,740
My bad, Young Master.

720
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,940
- Let's hurry up and go.
- Wait.

721
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,820
What's the deal with Shan Dandan?

722
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,940
How did she end up here?

723
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,860
I...

724
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,540
She must be here to deliver the painting
for that ugly painter.

725
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,980
What a coincidence.

726
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,500
It's that ugly painter again.

727
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,780
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

728
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,620
Go meet Huadian first.

729
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,140
- I'll settle the score with you later.
- Okay.

730
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,260
Go, go, go.

731
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Young Master, what are you doing now?

732
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,780
Innocent.

733
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,260
Young Master, wait for me.
