23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,310
(Xuanzheng Hall)

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,470
Is that true?

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,390
Every word is true.

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,600
The jade carving is far inferior

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,010
to the original Crown,

28
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,880
and the gold and silver fusion

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,060
and the Crown's seams are crude.

30
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,130
Since the Pei family incident,

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
Suyu Pavilion

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,570
has dominated the jade and jewelry industry.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,720
They're both century-old brands.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,240
I thought their skills would be comparable,

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,130
but it seems

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,850
that's not the case.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,270
I have an idea.

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,180
What idea?

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,210
Why not let Pei Pei have a try?

40
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,390
Nonsense.

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,080
Pei Chufeng embezzled the Crown

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,760
and the entire Pei family was confiscated.

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,550
How can I seek help from a criminal's son?

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,250
Your Lordship, please calm down.

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,390
Look.

46
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,340
Pei Chufeng has been dead for years.

47
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,300
The Pei family has already paid
for their crimes.

48
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,970
Besides, his son

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,740
had nothing to do with it.

50
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,300
You've seen Pei Pei's skills

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,740
at the Jade Competition.

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,920
I heard

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,200
he achieved such mastery

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,390
with just his left hand in a few months.

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,390
At the competition,

56
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,320
he copied the Su family's work.

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,370
Right before the competition,

58
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,900
Su Jue suddenly sent you a similar gift.

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,490
Who knows

60
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,810
if there was something fishy?

61
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Your Lordship,

62
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,490
no matter Pei Pei's past,

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,090
the priority now is to restore

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,340
the Moonlight Crown for the Emperor.

65
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,770
If Pei Pei fails,

66
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,900
nothing changes.

67
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,550
If he succeeds,

68
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,710
you can restore his Qipei Pavilion

69
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,550
because of that.

70
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,960
It's not difficult for you.

71
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,970
If the Emperor is pleased,

72
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,490
everything else won't matter.

73
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,810
What you said makes sense.

74
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,700
(City Lord's Secret Order)

75
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,180
What is it?

76
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,250
A secret order from the City Lord.

77
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,620
He wants me to restore the Moonlight Crown.

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,020
Really?

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,990
It's the Emperor's decree.

80
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,650
He commanded the City Lord
to complete the Crown within the deadline.

81
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,150
But didn't the City Lord

82
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,920
just confiscate our family property?

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,180
Why entrust us with this now?

84
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,970
If I'm not mistaken,

85
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,020
he's already approached Su Jue.

86
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,770
But he found that he couldn't do that.

87
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,340
Under the Emperor's pressure,

88
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,140
he has no choice but to try us.

89
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,390
The City Lord is indeed a petty man,

90
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,180
using people openly
and discarding them secretly.

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,140
What are you planning?

92
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,480
Will you take this job?

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Yes.

94
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,080
Have you thought it through?

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,530
This isn't a simple task.

96
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,040
Completing the Crown in such a short time...

97
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,930
Don't forget.

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,760
My father was the chief designer

99
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,320
of the original Crown.

100
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,360
Ms. Shuangshuang,

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,710
you have been meticulously studying

102
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,960
and mastering many Crown techniques.

103
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,680
If we can't complete it,

104
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,980
no one in Yuncui City can.

105
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,450
So you're thinking...

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Exactly.

107
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,330
I want to take this chance

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,130
to restore Qipei Pavilion's reputation.

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,300
This may be our only opportunity.

110
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
The Su family

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,370
will be desperate too.

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,590
Recreating the Moonlight Crown

113
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,180
and exposing their crimes.

114
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,100
This is the perfect chance.

115
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Right.

116
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,880
You focus on the creation.

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,250
Leave the rest to me.

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,330
I'll take the job,

119
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,590
but the City Lord must meet one condition.

120
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,540
What condition?

121
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,130
During the deadline,

122
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,560
the City Lord must send soldiers
to guard the entire Pei's Mansion

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,620
for our safety.

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Come on.

125
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,520
Come on.

126
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,030
Come on. One, two, three.

127
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,620
We can do this.

128
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,580
(Delight and Peace)

129
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,640
I'll handle the jade carving

130
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,540
for the Crown.

131
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,960
Leave the relief carving, hollow carving,

132
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,880
vertical carving,

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,100
and filigree carving to me.

134
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,300
I'll handle the gold and silver work.

135
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,270
Leave gold and silver inlay, melted bead,

136
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,330
and wire inlay to me.

137
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,490
But I only have half of the Crown.

138
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,780
I'm unsure if there are special techniques
on the other half.

139
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,120
I know that well.

140
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,320
Ms. Shuangshuang has mastered

141
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,610
about eighty percent of the techniques.

142
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,880
Besides my contributions

143
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,980
to the Moonlight Crown,

144
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,620
the most challenging part now

145
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,570
is Sun Wu's seamless welding

146
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,620
and Madam Cheng's colored gold techniques.

147
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,370
To fully restore the Crown,

148
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,570
we must visit them.

149
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll visit them.

150
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,220
They've been reclusive for years.

151
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,810
I don't know if they'll help.

152
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,320
I'll handle the Crown's casting.

153
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,300
It's been years,

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,490
and my hands are itching for this.

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,400
But

156
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,420
the materials needed for the Crown
are very expensive.

157
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,570
Given our current situation...

158
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,880
The most expensive water amber

159
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
is already in our hands.

160
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,860
What else do we fear?

161
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,780
Other parts still require

162
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,010
significant funds.

163
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,350
The City Lord is careless,

164
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,520
tasking us to remake the Crown

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,220
without financial support.

166
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,100
He wrote in the letter

167
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,810
that we are still criminals,

168
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
so

169
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,220
he can't support us openly.

170
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,220
This mission is a secret.

171
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,780
If we want to clear our names,

172
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,690
we can only rely on ourselves.

173
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,640
Remember

174
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,390
when the madam wanted to use her dowry

175
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,640
to save Qipei Pavilion,

176
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,250
and I dissuaded her with a few words?

177
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,440
Of course, I remember.

178
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
When I asked what you said,

179
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,200
you said it was a secret.

180
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,270
I told the madam

181
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,420
to consider the dowry as my betrothal gift.

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,470
I thought it would be her last keepsake for us,

183
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,980
and we could've kept it for future generations.

184
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,250
Now it seems we have to use it.

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,540
- Dandan.
- Alright.

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,010
Are we all set now?

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,890
We're all set.

188
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,620
This time, we're going all out.

189
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,750
All out.

190
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,150
What should we carve on these two pieces?

191
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,370
The hardness isn't good.

192
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
And the left piece

193
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,390
can only be used for up to one-third
of the base.

194
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,810
Not good. Find more.

195
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,000
Young Master, we've finished the ornament.

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Open it.

197
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,180
Not bad this time.

198
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
It's good.

199
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
Young Master.

200
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,120
Go back to work.

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,010
Yes.

202
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,550
What's wrong?

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,890
Young Master, it's not good.

204
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
I went to watch Pei's Mansion

205
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,830
and found it surrounded by soldiers.

206
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,030
We can't get close at all.

207
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,780
Why are the soldiers surrounding Pei's Mansion?

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,250
I'm not sure.

209
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,850
On the surface, they seem to value us,

210
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,750
but secretly they're playing both sides.

211
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,810
Disgusting.

212
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,750
The Emperor appointed him to restore the Crown.

213
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,260
The City Lord is just afraid of mistakes.

214
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,420
He just doesn't trust me.

215
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,610
Alright, think of a way quickly.

216
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,040
Even if we can't complete the task,

217
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,570
we can't let Qipei Pavilion take the credit.

218
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,280
Otherwise, all the years

219
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,320
of establishing our position

220
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,330
could be lost overnight.

221
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,330
Pei Chufeng is now in their hands.

222
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,730
He was the chief designer

223
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,140
of the Moonlight Crown.

224
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,210
With his assistance...

225
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,320
That old man has been mad for years.

226
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,350
He's already useless.

227
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,660
Now I'm afraid...

228
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,590
Afraid of what?

229
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,280
Afraid that without Pei Chufeng's help,

230
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,920
Pei Pei can still win against me?

231
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,230
No, no.

232
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,570
That's not what I meant.

233
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,400
You're always number one

234
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,540
in my heart.

235
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,590
It's just that this matter is crucial.

236
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,540
We must be fully prepared.

237
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,930
Are there any other designers of the Crown

238
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,590
from back then?

239
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Besides Pei Chufeng,

240
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,060
there's Madam Cheng with her gold coloring

241
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,060
and Sun Wu's welding.

242
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,630
Master Cheng and her husband
have been reclusive for many years.

243
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,850
I still have contact with her,

244
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,180
but Sun Wu...

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,020
We need to ask around.

246
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,470
Hurry up.

247
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,060
We can't let Pei Pei get ahead of us.

248
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,310
Alright.

249
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,140
It's so beautiful.

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,180
Unfortunately,

251
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,900
we only have the furnace and mold now.

252
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,260
The tools for edge trimming
and carving are lacking.

253
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,730
Look, it's still a bit rough.

254
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,570
The City Lord's men

255
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,810
confiscated

256
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,780
all the valuable items.

257
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,900
I'll go ask the City Lord to return them.

258
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,440
Once items are confiscated,

259
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,610
they are usually sold off.

260
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,570
You won't be able to get them back.

261
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,710
I'll think of another way

262
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,750
and see if techniques can substitute

263
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,780
for tools.

264
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,160
By the way,

265
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,590
Pei,

266
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,540
here's the address of Sun Wu and Master Cheng.

267
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,330
Hurry and visit them to seek their guidance.

268
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,870
When you meet them,

269
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,960
tell them that years of hard work went in vain,

270
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,060
but we need their help now

271
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,140
to restore the brilliance of the past.

272
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,560
Time is tight.

273
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,710
Let's act separately.

274
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,080
You go to see Sun Wu,

275
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,180
and I'll go to Master Cheng's place.

276
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,670
- Be careful.
- You must be cautious.

277
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,510
Don't be reckless.

278
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,680
(Pei's Mansion)

279
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
Understood.

280
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,960
Take care of my sister.

281
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,800
OK.

282
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,590
Can you manage alone?

283
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,610
Don't worry. No one can hurt me.

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,060
Be safe.

285
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
I'm leaving.

286
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,940
Let's go.

287
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,260
(Pei's Mansion)

288
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Have some tea.

289
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,700
(Master Cheng of the Colored Gold Techniques)

290
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,610
Someone's here.

291
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,350
Master Cheng.

292
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,540
Who are you?

293
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,500
Who exactly are you?

294
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,210
What brings you here?

295
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,590
Master Cheng, your colored gold techniques

296
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,900
once stirred the entire Central Plains.

297
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,610
It's a pity

298
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,060
you've retired here.

299
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,900
How do you know about that?

300
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,090
Actually,

301
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,140
my father was also an acquaintance of yours.

302
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,610
Who is your father?

303
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,300
This is our young master,

304
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,210
Su Jue, the owner
of Yuncui City's Suyu Pavilion.

305
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,970
You are Su Zhiyan's son?

306
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
How is your father?

307
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,810
He has been deceased for many years.

308
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,670
I'm sorry.

309
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,690
Why

310
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,540
are you here today?

311
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,510
Master Cheng, you're straightforward.

312
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,690
I won't beat around the bush.

313
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,400
I need to restore the Moonlight Crown.

314
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,510
I hope you

315
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,730
can lend me your help.

316
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,850
I've long forgotten

317
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,780
those colored gold techniques.

318
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,450
Forgotten?

319
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,850
What a good excuse.

320
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,380
Master Cheng, I'd like to ask you.

321
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,540
Can something carved into one's bones

322
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,810
be forgotten just like that?

323
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,060
Isn't this refusal a bit too far-fetched?

324
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,730
I've retired without practicing for many years,

325
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,470
never intending to return.

326
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,140
Please leave.

327
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,420
Are you not helping me,

328
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,380
or are you refusing to help anyone?

329
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,470
What if today's visitor were Pei Chufeng's son?

330
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,330
Pei?

331
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,020
It seems you simply don't want to help me.

332
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,090
What grievances did my father have with you

333
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,440
to make you so stingy?

334
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,280
Yes.

335
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,900
Things weren't good between your father and me.

336
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,710
Su Zhiyan's skills were mediocre,

337
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,450
yet he resorted to vicious acts.

338
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,780
I will never side with him in my life.

339
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,350
We've been looking for him for a day.

340
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,500
Where is he anyway?

341
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,540
Are you tired? Why don't you take a break?

342
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,450
We don't have much time left.

343
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,640
Then I'll carry you.

344
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,090
I know you're tired too.

345
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,180
I received your love.

346
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,970
- We can do this.
- We can do this.

347
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,950
Dandan.

348
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,900
Dandan, are you alright?

349
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,500
Dandan, wake up.

350
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,830
Dandan.

351
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,640
Dandan.

352
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,240
Here.

353
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
How are you?

354
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,760
I'm fine.

355
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,160
That's good.

356
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,330
Are you hurt?

357
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,470
No.

358
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,900
Where are we?

359
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,960
We fell into an ambush

360
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,140
and landed in a trap.

361
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,970
But the soil was freshly turned around.

362
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,450
The pit must have been dug
only in the past couple of days.

363
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,810
We'd better find a way out first.

364
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,400
Come on.

365
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,730
Is anyone there?

366
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,850
Is anyone there?

367
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,140
Help!

368
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,540
You can step on me.

369
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,520
- Come on.
- Wait a moment.

370
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm too heavy for you.

371
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,990
It's so high. It's impossible

372
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,090
to climb out of this hole.

373
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,810
Are we going to die here?

374
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,090
If I have to die with you,

375
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,460
I'd have no regrets.

376
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Don't say that.

377
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,780
Hurry up. Bah, bah, bah.

378
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Bah, bah, bah.

379
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,750
Young Master, your satisfaction

380
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,330
is the greatest affirmation of my service.

381
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,460
Who would have such a ridiculous name?

382
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,020
Young Master,

383
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
that character is "Shan".

384
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,570
I'm Shan Dandan.

385
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,540
Your family's business is vast.

386
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,470
You should keep up with culture.

387
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,440
- You...

388
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,350
- There's more.

389
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,220
Your name is also quite funny.

390
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,650
Pei Pei.

391
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Bah.

392
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Bah.

393
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
Bah.

394
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,640
These two words are fine,

395
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,220
but if it were three... Bah, bah, bah.

396
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,220
Too inauspicious.

397
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Dan Dandan.

398
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,610
Bah, bah, bah.

399
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,650
It seems we won't get out anytime soon.

400
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,840
Well.

401
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,170
It's quite cold here.

402
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,070
Here.

403
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,230
Once we get out,

404
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,440
I want to go to the most expensive night market

405
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,230
to eat the four-taels candied hawthorns

406
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,440
and the two-taels...

407
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,310
Sour plum juice.

408
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,150
Yes.

409
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll buy them.

410
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,370
Then let's get ten portions

411
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,610
for Ms. Dandan.

412
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Good.

413
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,130
Take me to learn fishing too.

414
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,410
What's that sound?

415
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,390
Don't be afraid.

416
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Who's there?

417
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,460
Who's outside?

418
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,510
I'd like to ask who's inside.

419
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,790
(Sun Wu, Master of Welding Techniques)
I don't think you want to come out.

420
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,940
Just daydreaming there.

421
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,910
We're saved!

422
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,700
I'm Pei Pei from Qipei Pavilion.

423
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,680
Please help us.

424
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,880
We will definitely repay you greatly.

425
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,260
You're Pei Chufeng's son?

426
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,520
Great!

427
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,020
You know my father?

428
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,200
Come on.

429
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,020
What are you doing here?

430
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,090
I came to find Mr. Sun Wu,

431
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,940
but before I could find him,

432
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,890
I was ambushed.

433
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Oh.

434
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,060
So you're looking for me?

435
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,360
You are Mr. Sun Wu?

436
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,710
Alright, come up first.

437
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,020
Wait. I'll get you a rope.

438
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,110
OK.

439
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,640
You two, stay back.

440
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,700
- We're saved.
- We're saved.

441
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,630
Come on.

442
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,550
Be careful.

443
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,960
Are you alright?

444
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm fine.

445
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,500
Sir, we're here to ask for your help.

446
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,470
Help with what?

447
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,460
You may not know,

448
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,220
but the City Lord secretly ordered me
to restore the Moonlight Crown.

449
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,610
I urgently need
your seamless welding techniques.

450
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,740
Please help me for the sake of my father.

451
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,890
Ordered you?

452
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,200
I heard

453
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,890
he appointed that Su kid from the Su family.

454
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,030
Their techniques are inadequate,

455
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,220
so they turned to us.

456
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,650
I'm glad you said that.

457
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,810
The Su family's techniques are lacking.
I agree.

458
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
But come on.

459
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,310
Who would be so wicked

460
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,750
as to dig such a big pit?

461
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,680
Wicked, indeed.

462
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,740
No, well...

463
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,920
It might not be wicked.

464
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,300
This pit was meant to catch wild animals.

465
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,700
There are wolves in the mountains.

466
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,760
Like this.

467
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,130
There are wolves.

468
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,880
Wolves.

469
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,460
How do you know there are wild animals?

470
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,740
I've lived in these mountains for many years.

471
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,940
How could I not know?

472
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,330
This pit was dug by you, wasn't it?

473
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,030
How could it be that I dug it?

474
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,570
- How many days did it take?
- Three days.

475
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,840
No, I mean...

476
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,750
If I had to dig this pit,

477
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,130
it would take me three days.

478
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,360
What's wrong?

479
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,160
We've fallen into the pit you dug.

480
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,550
Our lives were at stake.

481
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,330
Will you help us or not?

482
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,330
Alright, I'll help.

483
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

484
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,200
Alright, alright.

485
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,780
You two don't need to thank me.

486
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,810
Your father and I

487
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,610
were old friends.

488
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,850
I should help you anyway.

489
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,410
Alright, let's go.

490
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Let's go.

491
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,710
How did I do with the wolf howl just now?

492
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,980
It sounded very much like it.

493
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,160
What about this pit?

494
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,090
Oh, I didn't dig it.

495
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,540
Get the cyan from the kingfisher.

496
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,410
Mix it with 50% of gold water
to lighten the color.

497
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,500
Get the pink form from the April peony.

498
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,890
Let the autumn dew set the color with gold.

499
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,270
Apart from the box of pigments on the table,

500
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,980
there are no more colored gold techniques.

501
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,130
I followed the addresses given by the elders

502
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,940
and searched one by one

503
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,940
but couldn't find Sun Wu's whereabouts.

504
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,410
There's no way to know

505
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,230
whether he's dead or alive.

506
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,070
Forget it.

507
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,270
If we can't find him,

508
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,940
Pei must be out of luck too.

509
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,300
At least we have the colored gold techniques.

510
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,680
The color structure of gemstones and jade

511
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,030
can attract high officials
and nobles at a glance.

512
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,460
As for the welding details and carving,

513
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,300
let it go.

514
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,310
By the way, news just came in.

515
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,120
The Empress's illness has worsened recently,

516
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,570
and she might not last a few more days.

517
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,610
So we need to hurry.

518
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,060
In the coming days,
I'll start working in seclusion.

519
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,980
Don't disturb me unless necessary.

520
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,740
Once the Crown body is finished,

521
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,120
I'll work with the old craftsman
to add color and gilding.

522
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,230
Time waits for no one.

523
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,070
Alright.

524
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,370
Hurry up.

525
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,630
Shuangshuang.

526
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,750
Why did you take so long?

527
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,990
I was worried sick.

528
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,270
There were some minor issues,

529
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,920
but they're all resolved now.

530
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,940
Glad it's resolved.

531
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,460
What about Pei?

532
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
He's coming soon.

533
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,500
Has he learned the welding technique?

534
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,070
Master, learning this technique
takes at least a year or so.

535
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,610
You're expecting too much from us.

536
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,540
Perhaps I was too impatient.

537
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,400
But even if we can't master

538
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,330
the seamless welding,

539
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,370
just bringing back some basic techniques

540
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,300
will definitely give us
a significant advantage.

541
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,260
Everyone says jade ornaments
depend on appearance,

542
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,800
but in my opinion,

543
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,500
details are the key.

544
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,270
We haven't learned the technique,

545
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,330
but,

546
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,550
Dad,

547
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,540
look who I brought back.

548
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,020
Sun!

549
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,910
Don't come closer.

550
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,240
You...

551
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,800
You...

552
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,170
Aren't you dead?

553
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,260
- I...
- Are you a ghost or not?

554
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,550
I'm not dead.

555
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm very much alive.

556
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,330
I am Pei Chufeng.

557
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
You!

558
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,040
You...

559
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,160
Are you really Pei Chufeng?

560
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,330
Sun, I am Pei Chufeng.

561
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,130
I knew it.

562
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,500
How could you suddenly be gone?

563
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,540
I've missed you so much.

564
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,280
Me too.

565
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,170
- Alright.
- Let me check you out.

566
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,750
It really is you.

567
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,640
Sun,

568
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,260
I will tell you about the grievances

569
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,030
and hardships from back then,

570
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,870
Good.

571
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,540
It's truly a great joy

572
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,850
that you came to help me today.

573
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,790
We'll definitely revive the glory of the Crown.

574
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,630
Yes.

575
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,460
Sit, sit.

576
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,920
You sit. You sit.

577
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,220
- You sit.
- Sit down. Come on and sit.

578
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,820
(Pei's Mansion)

579
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,330
Master, have some tea.

580
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,350
Thank you.

581
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,460
Mr. Sun hasn't arrived yet?

582
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,570
He's welding large items in the workshop.

583
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,370
With his help,

584
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,940
we're a step closer to victory.

585
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,040
Give it to me.

586
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,410
What's wrong, Master Pei?

587
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,070
Look at this.

588
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,740
The welding of large pieces

589
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,810
and the polishing of the Crown body
are relatively easy.

590
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,890
Pei is also quite adept

591
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,540
at jade carving.

592
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,540
But now we lack fine tools,

593
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,990
furnaces,

594
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,890
and materials.

595
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,700
So the detailed filigree and embellishments

596
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,410
are really challenging.

597
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,550
Although these details

598
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,990
are not noticeable to others,

599
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,540
Qipei Pavilion's reputation

600
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,780
has lasted for a century

601
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,940
because of the meticulous craftsmanship

602
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,260
in every tiny bit.

603
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,850
There's no room for sloppy work.

604
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,850
This is the spirit of Qipei Pavilion.

605
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,060
What about tools from business partners
you're friendly with?

606
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,060
Yuncui City nowadays
is no longer what it used to be.

607
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
The so-called fine tools, molds,

608
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
and furnaces from small merchants

609
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,990
are probably even worse

610
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,260
than what's left at Qipei Pavilion.

611
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,700
Pei is right.

612
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,090
In the entire Yuncui City,

613
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,650
there's probably only one place to find them.

614
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,260
Suyu Pavilion.

615
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,410
I'll handle it.

616
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,330
I'll also check on the colored gold techniques.

617
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,000
Shuangshuang.

618
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,540
I'll take care of it.

619
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,360
I'll infiltrate their workshop

620
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,570
under the pretense of helping Su Jue,

621
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,130
finish the delicate parts,

622
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,550
and secretly swap them

623
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,790
to bring them back to you.

624
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,990
But the Su family is ruthless.

625
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,960
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

626
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,300
They've been searching for me everywhere.

627
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,400
So since I returned to Pei's Mansion,

628
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,570
I've been extra cautious to hide myself.

629
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,470
They probably still think

630
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,230
I've fallen out with you

631
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,300
and am wandering outside.

632
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,510
- But...
- Even so,

633
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,310
it's still not appropriate for a woman like you

634
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,260
to take such risks.

635
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,790
Though I'm a woman,

636
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,940
who among you can match me?

637
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,910
Well.

638
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,470
Rest assured.

639
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,060
Su Jue won't do anything to me.

640
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,740
Besides,

641
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,570
I have personal business

642
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,850
to settle with the Su family.

643
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,880
Shuangshuang, you must be careful.

644
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,740
If anything goes wrong, come back quickly.

645
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,360
At 11:45 pm every night,

646
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,840
wait for me at the back door of Su's Mansion.

647
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,740
I'll hand over the completed parts to you.

648
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,840
After you return,

649
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,650
please have Mr. Sun weld them onto the Crown.

650
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,350
Understood.

651
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,310
Thank you.

652
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,070
Shuangshuang.

653
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,240
Shuangshuang.

654
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,550
I heard Young Master say
you're going undercover at Suyu Pavilion.

655
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,360
You can't go. It's too dangerous.

656
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,680
Why did he tell you this?

657
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,850
You still want to hide it from me?

658
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,070
I'm just going to work
at Suyu Pavilion for a few days.

659
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,460
It's not like going to the execution ground.

660
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,550
Why are you so anxious?

661
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,990
What's the difference between Suyu Pavilion

662
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,840
and the execution ground?

663
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,270
Don't exaggerate that.

664
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,960
I stayed there for a long time before,

665
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,020
and nothing happened to me.

666
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,600
But this time...

667
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,890
This is the final battle
between Qipei Pavilion and the Su family.

668
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,540
Only I can do this.

669
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,130
The Pei family needs me.

670
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,710
I know you're worried about me,

671
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,940
but you can rest assured.

672
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,600
Since I dare to go,

673
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,980
I have my own way to escape.

674
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,030
Take good care of your injuries.

675
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,370
When I come back,

676
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,700
I want to see a lively you.

677
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,460
You will always be my younger brother.

678
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,630
I'm leaving.

679
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,500
(I need to settle my debt)

680
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,460
(with the Su family as well.)

681
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,520
Young Master.

682
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,570
Didn't I ask you not to bother me?

683
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,220
Young Master, Ms. Shuangshuang is back.

684
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,850
Why didn't you say so earlier?

685
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,580
(Su's Mansion)

686
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,640
- Ms. Shuangshuang.
- Shuangshuang.

687
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,560
Ms. Shuangshuang.

688
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,510
Ms. Shuangshuang, what's wrong?

689
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,650
- Shuangshuang.
- Ms. Shuangshuang.

690
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,070
Shuangshuang.

691
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,960
Shuangshuang.

692
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,030
- What happened?
- Ms. Shuangshuang.

693
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,990
Get away.

694
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,060
How dare you touch her?

695
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,940
Shuangshuang, Shuangshuang.

696
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,810
Get the doctor.

697
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,550
Shuangshuang.

698
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,850
Young Master.

699
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,220
You're awake. How are you?

700
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,720
Be careful.

701
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,710
The doctor said you're exhausted

702
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,960
and have suffered a severe blow.

703
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,090
What exactly happened?

704
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,520
And

705
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,130
where have you been during this time?

706
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,540
Young Master, I'm thirsty.

707
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,280
Here.

708
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,330
Thank you, Young Master.

709
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,500
This matter is hard to explain.

710
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,610
I have to start with my background.

711
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,040
Tell me.

712
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,440
I was Shan Jingtian's daughter.

713
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,810
He's the thief who stole the Crown.

714
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,610
So, why did you join Suyu Pavilion?

715
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,740
Mr. Su,

716
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,220
now that things have come to this,

717
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,260
I don't want to hide anything from you.

718
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,130
I joined Suyu Pavilion

719
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,090
to investigate

720
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,570
who hired my father back then.

721
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,060
I know my father was innocent.

722
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,810
He must have been framed by evil people.

723
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,780
But I was wrong.

724
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,220
I wrongly blamed you, Mr. Su.

725
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,410
Later, I discovered

726
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,740
that the Pei family was the real thief.

727
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,550
So I resolutely

728
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,090
turned to the Pei family

729
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,740
to avenge my father's death.

730
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,700
Mr. Su,

731
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,020
because of my own issues,

732
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,060
I couldn't open up to you before.

733
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,090
You were so great to me, but I...

734
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,570
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

735
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,170
It's alright.

736
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,980
As long as you've cleared things up.

737
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,130
Suyu Pavilion will always be your home.

738
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,850
As long as you're willing to return,

739
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,160
I will never

740
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,500
hold past grievances against you.

741
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,330
Thank you, Mr. Su.

742
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,800
Then

743
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,020
why did you leave the Pei family afterward?

744
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,810
On the day their property was confiscated,

745
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,780
I wanted to kill Pei Pei,

746
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,890
but Dandan protected him desperately.

747
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,510
As a woman,

748
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,750
I was outnumbered

749
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,260
and couldn't fight against them,

750
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,890
so I had no choice but to escape first.

751
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,060
I thought about returning to Suyu Pavilion,

752
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,890
but I couldn't face you again,

753
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,540
so I started wandering around.

754
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,690
Today, outside the city gate,

755
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,060
bandits robbed me of all my possessions.

756
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I was truly left with no way out.

757
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,120
So...

758
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,860
So…

759
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,980
Shuangshuang, don't worry.

760
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,820
As long as I'm here,

761
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,130
you will never suffer such grievances again.

762
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,160
Are you hungry?

763
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,170
I'll prepare some food for you.

764
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,980
Rest well.

765
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,980
Don't worry.

766
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,360
Ms. Shuangshuang is highly skilled

767
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,410
and meticulous in her thoughts.

768
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,020
Moreover, she is the most mature among us.

769
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,570
Since this is her choice,

770
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,090
we should trust her.

771
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,570
But she's alone there...

772
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,320
Some inner conflicts

773
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,020
can only be resolved by herself.

774
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,070
I really hope these anxious

775
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,690
and uncertain times can end soon.

776
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,210
Just recover

777
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,610
from your leg wound soon.

778
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,030
That's one

779
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,460
of our biggest concerns right now.

780
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,210
I'll work hard to stand up.

781
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,820
I really hope these days pass quickly.

782
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,650
Actually,

783
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,210
I also have some good news.

784
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,470
Dad and Mr. Sun

785
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,360
have basically completed the Crown body

786
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,570
and the welding of large items.

787
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,470
My jade belt and jade pendant

788
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,940
are also taking shape.

789
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,590
It seems the Crown's revival

790
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,820
is just around the corner.

791
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
Alright, let's eat.

792
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,860
We need to eat to have the strength to work.

793
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,210
Young Master, eat more.

794
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,760
Here.

795
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,910
Liu.

796
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,780
(Ingenious Workmanship)

797
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,960
Mr. Xu,

798
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,420
the filigree is too tight.

799
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,980
This won't work for the gold inlaid jade
on the Crown.

800
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,820
Why not try the No. 5 pincer?

801
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,880
Ms. Shuangshuang, your suggestion is right.

802
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,940
I'll go try it now.

803
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,860
Why are you here?

804
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,340
Is your health recovered?

805
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,770
I'm almost recovered.

806
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,960
But

807
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,540
you really need a good rest.

808
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,880
Mr. Su,

809
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,020
if we want to recreate the Moonlight Crown,

810
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,940
let me take over personally.

811
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,070
I'm the most skilled

812
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,090
in the gold and silver inlay

813
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,990
and jade filigree work in all of Suyu Pavilion.

814
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,210
If you're willing,

815
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,540
of course, that would be great.

816
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,820
To be honest, Young Master,

817
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,720
before my father passed away,

818
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,460
he brought back some remnants of the Crown.

819
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,510
I've been studying this craft for years,

820
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,980
and I finally learned it.

821
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,130
With me here, the Pei family won't succeed.

822
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,150
I said long ago

823
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,470
that you are my lucky star.

824
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,650
It seems I was right.

825
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,070
Heaven sent you back to me

826
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,610
in my darkest times.

827
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,460
What more could I ask for?

828
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,980
But I have one condition.

829
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,250
What condition?

830
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,070
My condition is

831
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,440
you must go back and sleep now.

832
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,720
If you continue like this,

833
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,070
your body will give out

834
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,540
before the Crown is finished.

835
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,390
Alright.

836
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,590
Then I'll rest for a while.

837
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,820
You also take care of yourself.

838
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,500
(He's applying colored gold paint.)

839
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,900
Mr. Yang,

840
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,110
I have a family secret technique

841
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,730
that I want to complete in a hidden place.

842
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,770
Is it possible to switch places with you?

843
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,590
Sure. Ms. Shuangshuang, please.

844
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,430
Thank you.

845
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,860
(The colored gold knife.)

846
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,420
(The colored gold paint is hard to find.)

847
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,730
(Taking some might not be noticed.)

848
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
(Su's Mansion)

849
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,320
Listen to me.

850
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,340
For coloring with colored gold,

851
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,440
apply a light coat
when the gold is 40-50% melted

852
