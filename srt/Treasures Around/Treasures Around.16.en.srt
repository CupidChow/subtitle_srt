Don't worry. Leave it to me.

I'll treat you to a big meal afterward.

I'm discussing business. Don't interrupt.

After all,

33
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm the young master of Qipei Pavilion.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,770
How can I not be involved
in business, right?

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Mr. Tan,

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,530
I appreciate your kindness.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,930
But since it's our own trouble,

38
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,250
we should solve it ourselves.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,210
Goodbye.

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,810

42
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,110
Fine.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,720
Mr. Tan, don't leave.

44
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,280
Where are you going?

45
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,120
You promised to fight with me.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,330
Are you against me now?

47
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,210
I said I'd fight with you,

48
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,720
but only me.

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,090

only Mr. Tan
has the ink printing technique.

54
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,490
You drove him away.

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680

It's just drawing.

58
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,810

then Qipei Pavilion is women's world.

to frequent our jewelry shop.

163
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,820
where I made you suffer?

164
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,100

Right. The tea party.

168
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,120
It's filled with wives of noble families.

169
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,970
It must be a prelude

170

171
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,220
Tea parties

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,700
are to make small profits
by befriending women.

173
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,150
It's disgraceful.

174
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
Wives of noble families

175
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,340
are not ordinary people.

176
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,910
Don't underestimate them.

177
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,070
Yuncui City respects jade above all.

178
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,340
Most daily business is in men's hands.

179
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,360
Small jewelry

180
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,980
won't match their noble status.

181
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,790
Watch and see how long they last.

182
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,550
Better be cautious.

183
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,070
Send more people to watch them closely.

184
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Yes.

185
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,970
Dear guests,

186
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,480
we have a little surprise

187
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,940
for you today at Qipei Pavilion.

188
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,330
- Surprise?
- There's a surprise?

189
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,720
We've selected a batch of fine jewelry

190
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,360
- from our new collection.
- This looks nice.

191
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,810
- We hope some of you
- The quality is good.

192
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,310
can become their first owners.

193
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,000
You can see the quality.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,760
We will auction them

195
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,000
to find their owners.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Auction?

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,940
Whoever bids the most will get it.

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,340
You won't get any.

199
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,000
Who do you look down on?

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,310
Our family can't be short
on jewelry money.

201
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,850
Put down the burden and open your mind.

202
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,930
Hurry.

203
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,290
Go ahead.

204
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
Liu.

205
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,390
Ladies, the first item.

206
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,700
A gold lotus agate hairpin.

207
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,620
Starting bid at 50 taels.

208
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,720
I bid 60 taels.

209
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,860
How petty. Two hundred taels.

210
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,050
Three hundred taels.

211
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,640
Whose wife is so generous?

212
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,270
Looks like you have competition today.

213
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,100
Five hundred taels.

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,790
Five hundred taels once.

215
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,430
Five hundred taels twice.

216
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,670
Five hundred taels.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,150
Sold!

218
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,840
- Great.
- Congratulations.

219
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,620
Congratulations to this lady.

220
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,430
Next, melted golden beads.

221
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,000
Starting bid at 80 taels.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840

223
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,600
Three hundred taels.

224
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,390
Stop fighting. I bid 500 taels.

225
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,050
Ugh. Six hundred taels.

226
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,940
I don't even want this one.

227
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,340
Six hundred taels once.

228
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,740
Six hundred taels twice.

229
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,100
Six hundred taels.

230
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,580
Sold!

231
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,310
- Congratulations to this lady.
- Great.

232
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,980
Next, the golden cat's eye earrings.

233
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,690
Starting bid at 50 taels.

234
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't just watch.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,820
At least try to get one.

236
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,620
I won't bid this time. You go ahead.

237
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,360
One hundred taels.

238
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,290
- Three hundred taels.
- I don't want it.

239
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,510
I don't want it.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,390
Three hundred taels once.

241
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,270

Next,

246
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,120
an ice jade lotus pearl dangling hairpin.

247
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,430
Starting bid at two hundred taels.

248
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,720
Oh, my. That's my favorite.

249
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,840
I bid 800 taels.

250
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,150
Don't anyone fight me for it.

251
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,250

Sold!

257
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
Mrs. Yang is truly impressive.

258
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,620
Next, a pearl
cloud-shaped danging hairpin.

259
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,930
Starting bid at 50 taels.

260
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,520

261
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,480

264
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,820
Two thousand taels.

265
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,410
Take these earrings away.

266
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,930
They're almost half my annual salary.

267
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,050
I can't afford it.

268
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,000
Come on. Please.

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,030
You keep it.

270
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,480
Well...

271
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,410
This was supposed to be for fun.

272
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,820
I don't have that much money.

273
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,640
It's a gift for you. It's free.

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,670
Free?

275
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,550
You should have said so earlier.

276
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,460
Aunt, you did great today.

277
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,970
I might not be good at much,

278
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,100
but pretending to be grand
is my specialty.

279
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,100
Aunt?

280
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,480
This is Ms. Dandan's idea.

281
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,190
I told you. All's fair in business.

282
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,190
I'll be off then.

283
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Thank you.

284
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,940
- Goodbye, Aunt.
- Goodbye.

285
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,250
Take care.

286
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,270
I see.

287
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,860
Why is she back?

288
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,270
Madam, let me explain.

289
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,790
- It's...
- Enough.

290
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,840
Should I call you smart

291
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,430
or foolish?

292
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,090
When our friend is in trouble,

293
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,120
it's right to support her

294
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,640
with our spare money.

295
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,000
You did well.

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,480
Madam Pei is lucky to have you

297
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,310
as a capable assistant.

298
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,670
Pei Pei, I'm off to find your mother.

299
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,550
Thank you.

300
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,740
Young Master.

301
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,880
(Ancient Jade Dealer)

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,360
Young Master, the sign is ready.

303
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,200
They're putting it up now.

304
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,680
The sign?

305
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,410
Let's go.

306
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,940
(Qipei Pavilion)

307
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,860
Young Master, how about placing it here?

308
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,100
(Qipei Jewelry Pavilion)

309
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,620
Thank you.

310
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,690
Let me add some hot water for you.

311
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,530
Careful.

312
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,690
That's enough.

313
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,580
A bit more.

314
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,410
Alright.

315
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,430
So relaxing.

316
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,880
You've been so busy lately.

317
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,700
You should rest well.

318
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,460
Not only me.

319
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,980
You've been working day and night.

320
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,070
Your hands

321
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,910
are covered in calluses.

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,390
It's my duty.

323
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,510
I work hard for Qipei Pavilion.

324
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,190
But Shuangshuang,

325
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,670
you work hard for me.

326
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,120
Even though you say nothing,

327
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,340
I understand.

328
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,390
Silly girl.

329
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,460
I'm just glad you're happy.

330
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,910
Have you decided on marrying Mr. Pei?

331
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,840
I'll take it one step at a time.

332
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,910
I haven't thought that far.

333
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,250
Dandan,

334
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,190
I have a question.

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,100
What if...

336
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,190
It's a hypothesis.

337
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,930
If the Pei family was your enemy,

338
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,670
would you still choose Pei Pei?

339
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,050
How could the Pei family be my enemy?

340
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,190
Shuangshuang,
that scenario doesn't exist.

341
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,700
True.

342
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,980
Have some more water.

343
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
I'll do it.

344
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,050
Let me.

345
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,310
Dandan, I need to talk to you.

346
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
Coming...

347
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,940
Just a moment.

348
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,390
Go ahead.

349
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,170
Alright.

350
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,690
Here.

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,100
For me?

352
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,620
I know you don't like fancy accessories,

353
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,510
so I made a sachet for you.

354
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
I haven't given you

355
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,140
a proper gift before,

356
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,180
so I made it this time.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,840
Dandan,

358
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,820
once Qipei Pavilion is stable,

359
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,990
I'll formally propose to you.

360
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,790
Then I'll give you something even better.

361
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,660
Dandan, what's wrong?

362
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,030
Nothing.

363
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,750
I've only ever had my sister.

364
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,510
Besides her,

365
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,760
no one

366
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,310
has ever given me a gift.

367
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,380
Thank you.

368
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,860
(Peace and Tranquility)

369
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,950
By the way, Dandan,

370
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,510
I've wanted to ask you a question

371
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,510
but never had the chance.

372
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,340
Where are your parents?

373
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,070
I don't know.

374
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,510
Ever since I could remember,

375
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,510
it's just been my sister and me.

376
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,420
To survive,

377
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,100
she took me everywhere.

378
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,710
She must have suffered a lot.

379
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,180
When I was twelve,

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,790
we came to Yuncui City.

381
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,710
It felt like we finally had a home.

382
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,660
But whenever I mentioned our parents,

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,340
my sister would say

384
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,140
they died of illness

385
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,950
and wouldn't talk about it.

386
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,420
I know

387
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,380
it's a pain in her heart.

388
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,660
This

389
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,860
is what my parents left me.

390
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,820
I've worn it since I was little.

391
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,790
It may be small, shabby,

392
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,510
and not valuable,

393
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,070
but whenever I face difficulties

394
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,100
or feel down,

395
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,230
looking at it

396
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,550
gives me strength.

397
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,420
It's my lucky charm.

398
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,790
I hope

399
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,100
it brings you luck too.

400
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,230
I'm giving it to you.

♪Moonlight is reflected in the water,
stars fill the sky♪

402
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,680
♪Who is the joy and sorrow for♪

403
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,120
♪The evening breeze

404
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,900
Consider it my dowry.

405
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,030
Silly girl.

406
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,420
I'll handle the bridal price and dowry.

407
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,370
♪Moonlight around your fingertips♪

408

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,940
(Qipei Pavilion)

410
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,230
Shopkeeper, you called for me?

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,420
Everyone's here.

412
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,620
Hello, Madam.

413
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,710
So many?

414
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,920
Yes.

415
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,930
The orders and revenue

416
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,170
have surpassed

417
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,860
our jade business days.

418
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,900
Ms. Dandan, you've made it.

419
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,100
It's all thanks to everyone.

420
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,480
Actually, I have something

421
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,340
to discuss with you today.

422
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,400
Please go ahead.

423
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,820
Your business acumen is evident to all.

424
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,310
I'm getting old.

425
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,370
Today, I want to officially

426
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,340
pass my position to you.

427
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,270
Please make the final decision.

428
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,240
How can that be?

429
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,180
You are the cornerstone
of Qipei Pavilion.

430
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,620
I just know some tricks.

431
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,080
Qipei Pavilion's revival

432
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,620
is all thanks to your management.

433
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,950
I'm old

434
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,410
and out of touch.

435
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,340
I can't keep up

436
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,660
with the latest trends

437
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,750
or the preferences of the nobles.

438
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,820
In the whole Qipei Pavilion,

439
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,030
you're the most suitable person for this.

440
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,820
Please accept it.

441
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,170
But I...

442
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,100
When Ms. Shan first joined us,

443
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,000
I was blinded by immediate gains

444
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,950
and losses

445
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,950
and caused you trouble.

446
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,860
Thinking back now, I'm ashamed.

447
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,930
Madam is right.

448
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,170
At my age,

449
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,080
I should be more magnanimous.

450
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,380
Only when Qipei Pavilion's reputation
stands strong,

451
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,030
will we all have good days ahead.

452
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Dandan,

453
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,100
Shopkeeper Hao
has made his intentions clear to me.

454
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,030
Since he's determined,

455
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,990
don't refuse his kindness.

456
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,270
I'm just trying to take it easy.

457
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,310
Once I officially step down,

458
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,790
I'll be content

459
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,230
helping with trivial matters.

460
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,030
Alright then.

461
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
But Shopkeeper Hao, you mustn't leave.

462
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,170
Many business matters still need you.

463
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,230
Don't worry.

464
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,710
I'm not going anywhere.

465
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,420
Qipei Pavilion is my home.

466
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,240
As long as I'm alive,

467
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,420
I won't leave.

468
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,990
Congratulations, our new shopkeeper.

469
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,080
The jewelry profits of Qipei Pavilion

470
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,650
not only match the past

471
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,510
but are also on par with Suyu Pavilion.

472
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,710
How did Qipei Pavilion get so capable?

473
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,480
It's said that
most of the exquisite jewelry

474
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,320
is crafted by Ms. Shuangshuang,

475
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
and her cunning sister

476
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,900
with her clever sales tactics.

477
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,860
If I had known,

478
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,130
I wouldn't have

479
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,970
let Ms. Shuangshuang leave.

480
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,810
Uncle,

481
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,990
no need to say this.

482
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,210
Yes.

483
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,080
Actually, Qipei Pavilion

484
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,560
is not in direct competition with us.

485
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,900
No matter how well they do,

486
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,040
it doesn't matter.

487
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,690
No, as long as I'm alive,

488
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,660
I must see Qipei Pavilion underfoot.

489
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,270
That's the spirit I like in my nephew.

490
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,420
That unyielding determination.

491
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,820
A friend from afar

492
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,900
might help us a lot.

493
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,100
What are you pondering so wistfully?

494
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,340
(Shan Dandan, Qipei Pavilion's Shopkeeper)
Is it because I became the shopkeeper?

495
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,240
How could I be wistful

496
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,690
with such a capable shopkeeper

497
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,660
making the business flourish?

498
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,340
It's just...

499
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,340
I've been away from jade for too long.

500
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,550
I'm itching to get back.

501
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,820
Trust me.

502
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,920
It'll be soon.

503
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,240
After comparing several works,

504
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,950
I found Su Jue's technique to be mediocre

505
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,750
and can't compare with Mr. Pei's.

506
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,510
The previous Jade Competition showed

507
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,520
Mr. Pei, it only took you

508
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,080
several months

509
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
to be on par
with Su Jue's decades of skill

510
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,070
in carving with the left hand.

511
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,990
But one thing puzzles me.

512
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,850
If Su Zhiyan

513
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,750
could make Suyu Pavilion so successful,

514
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,000
why is it that now Suyu Pavilion

515
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,270
relies on underhanded methods?

516
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,790
"Wealth doesn't last three generations."

517
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,520
His father's skill

518
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,170
doesn't guarantee his.

519
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,990
Suyu Pavilion will be ruined by him.

520
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,400
What is it?

521
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,950
It's just a pity.

522
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,520
In Yuncui City,

523
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,710
those seeking jade from far and wide

524
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
can only get

525
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,990
inferior products from greedy hands.

526
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,310
True jade carving skills

527
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,180
and jade-like gentlemen
don't deserve this.

528
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,380
Why do you all look so worried?

529
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,130
Why are you so happy?

530
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,320
Don't you know?

531
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,900
A wealthy man has come to Yuncui City,

532
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,040
lavishly spending,

533
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,230
buying everything in sight.

534
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,950
And he's a handsome young gentleman.

535
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,250
Liu,

536
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,930
you grew up in a big household.

537
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,450
Don't act like
you've never seen the world.

538
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,890
No, Young Master.

539
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,760
This one is truly rich.

540
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,560
Spending tens of thousands
of taels at once.

541
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,750
Tens of thousands of taels?

542
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,900
Let's go and see.

543
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,970
Let's go, Shuangshuang.

544
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,920
Young Master.

545
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,470
Quite enticing, isn't it?

546
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,730
Take a bite.

547
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
Here, sir.

548
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,750
Why not buy one?

549
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,490
Right?

550
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,840
You want one too?

551
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,030
I'll get one for you as well.

552
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,130
Sir, look.

553
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,550
You'll all get one.

554
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,580
With me, you'll never lack for anything.

555
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,800
What a graceful young man,

556
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,100
clearly from a wealthy family.

557
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,750
Dandan, where are you going?

558
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,380
Shuangshuang,
we need to secure a big order.

559
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,730
Let's go.

560
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,240
How's this color?

561
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,710
- Please stop, sir.
- This one is nice.

562
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,950
Who dares to stop my carriage?

563
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,380
I'm Shan Dandan,
Qipei Pavilion's shopkeeper.

564
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,070
Sir,

565
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,380
you have such grace and presence.

566
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,180
Are you interested
in gold and silver jewelry?

567
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,790
Our jewelry

568
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,650
is top-notch in Yuncui City.

569
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,720
Recently,

570
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,270
they were highly sought after
at the auction.

571
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,930
If you're interested,

572
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,210
why not visit our place

573
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,080
to pick some pieces?

574
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,100
What jewelry hasn't our master seen?

575
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,580
No need to go to your place to choose.

576
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
I've seen enough gold and silver jewelry.

577
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,080
Nothing special.

578
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,930
They can't compare to the beauty of jade.

579
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,950
I'd rather spend time with these ladies.

580
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,710
Exactly.

581
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,310
It's understandable
that you don't want to go.

582
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,000
But ladies,

583
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,580
wouldn't you like to take a look?

584
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,180
Miss,

585
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,610
your gentle demeanor is lovely,

586
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,990
but this gardenia flower,

587
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,340
though beautiful, is not unique.

588
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,660
Why not choose a shell dangling hairpin
from our place?

589
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,450
It would add a touch of elegance.

590
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,990
A shell dangling hairpin?

591
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,510
That's not very common.

592
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,760
That's not all.

593
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,360
We also have items made
of wood, stone, and fabric.

594
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,620
Each piece is a masterpiece.

595
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,080
And you ladies

596
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,280
are already so beautiful.

597
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,340
Wearing our jewelry

598
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,140
will surely make you stunning.

599
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,380
Wouldn't you like to take a look?

600
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,760
Sir.

601
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,650
- Let's go.
- Take us there.

602
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,550
Do you really want to go?

603
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,930
Yes.

604
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,820
Then let's go.

605
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,030
- Driver, follow this...
- Wonderful.

606
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,230
Shan Dandan.

607
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,340
Your name is Shan Dandan?

608
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,580
What an interesting name.

609
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,840
Let's go.

610
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,340
(Si Ruyu from Modu)

611
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,760
(Qipei Pavilion)

612
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,170
- Liu.
- Coming.

613
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,010
Hurry.

614
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,450
Show the ladies around.

615
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,030
Sure. Ladies, please come inside.

616
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,310
Dandan, I'll head to the workshop.

617
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,180
Mr. Si...

618
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,500
(Qipei Pavilion)

619
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,450
You must be Pei Pei.

620
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,510
Do you recognize me, sir?

621
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,010
Indeed.

622
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,520
In the jade world, I'm...

623
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,360
I've heard of you.

624
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,690
In Yuncui City,

625
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,470
only Mr. Pei

626
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,550
can match my reputation for idleness.

627
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,470
That was in the past.

628
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,930
Mr. Pei is now highly talented,

629
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,770
right?

630
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,210
Dandan. Ms. Dandan.

631
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,000
Come help us choose jewelry.

632
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,230
Coming. Sir, excuse me.

633
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,980
(Qipei Pavilion)

634
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,080
Miss, look at this.

635
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,660
This Seven Treasure Linglong Hairpin,

636
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,690
made with shells
and accented with amethyst,

637
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,470
suits your temperament perfectly.

638
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,370
It won't overshadow you

639
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,620
but will add to your beauty.

640
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
This lady's demeanor

641
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,230
is as cold

642
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,340
as the deep winter,

643
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,990
with the fragrance of plum blossoms.

644
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,070
This sandalwood plum hairpin
and silver beaded bracelet

645
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,660
complement each other well.

646
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,450
What about me?

647
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,490
Mr. Pei,

648
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,690
this lady is also a beauty,

649
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,990
but her sharp tongue is troublesome.

650
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,990
I don't dare provoke her.

651
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,990
Everyone has their preferences.

652
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,550
I find every trait of hers

653
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,790
endearing.

654
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,470
Like a fine jade,

655
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,310
it just needs a bit of carving

656
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,140
to reveal its true beauty.

657
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,890
I have some accessories at home

658
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,950
suitable for men.

659
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,990
Would you like to see them, sir?

660
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,450
I have plenty of accessories. No need.

661
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,420
But...

662
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,950
If you have something to say, say it.

663
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,950
Is your business always known
for gold and silver jewelry?

664
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,720
Sir, come and look at this!

665
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,690
Isn't it beautiful?

666
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,000
Mine is beautiful too!

667
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,970
Mine is beautiful!

668
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,810
Beautiful.

669
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,450
Mr. Pei, sorry for the intrusion.

670
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,380
Don't worry about it.

671
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,720
Sir, these are all so pretty!

672
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,900
I love them all.

673
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,450
Yes, buy one for us.

674
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,320
Buy one!

675
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,410
- Sir, please!
- I like this one too!

676
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,250
Buy one!

677
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,340
I'll buy them all.

678
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,900
Pick a few more.

679
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,650
- Sir.
- You're so generous.

680
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,070
Our store's jewelry is always popular,

681
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,470
but we have limited stock.

682
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,320
If you like,

683
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,820
I'll give you a discount.

684
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,270
These items in their hands
total 3,000 taels.

685
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,560
3,000 taels.

686
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,270
3,000 taels?

687
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,070
These trinkets

688
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,380
aren't worth that much.

689
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,600
Sir,

690
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,140
you don't understand a woman's heart.

691
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,550
Jewelry is valued for its rarity.

692
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,280
And our store's pieces

693
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,580
are unique,

694
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,380
unmatched in the world.

695
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,270
Your term "trinkets"
doesn't do them justice.

696
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,640
Besides,

697
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,130
you didn't come to Yuncui City

698
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,040
just for sightseeing, did you?

699
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,320
Perhaps we could discuss

700
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,620
a long-term collaboration.

701
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,560
Do you really want them?

702
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,660
Yes.

703
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,400
I have no choice.

704
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,550
I only have money left.

705
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,010
Sir,

706
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,480
you truly are wealthy.

707
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,080
No wonder you're surrounded
by so many beauties.

708
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,680
It makes sense.

709
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,990
- Liu.
- Wait.

710
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,180
Though I have money,

711
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,390
every penny counts.

712
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,080
How about this?

713
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,600
Let's make a bet.

714
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,680
If I win,

715
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,260
you give these jewels to my beauties.

716
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,000
If you win...

717
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
If I win,

718
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,600
you buy all the jewelry

719
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,740
in my store.

720
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,080
I don't care
if you'll keep it for yourself

721
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,910
or resell it.

722
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,000
If it sells well,

723
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,950
we'll give you a long-term supply.

724
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,950
A true businesswoman.

725
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,120
We can afford to lose,

726
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,990
but if we win, we'll gain a lot.

727
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,700
Whatever the challenge is.

728
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,910
Sir, are you afraid to compete?

729
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,170
Let's do it.

730
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,870
Go for it, sir!

731
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
- Go for it, sir!
- Ms. Dandan.

732
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,780
Go for it!

733
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,870
Sir.

734
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,470
Go for it.

735
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,950
Go for it, sir.

736
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,640
You'll win, sir.

737
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,740
- Go for it.
- Sir.

738
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,260
- Go for it.
- Sir.

739
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,390
Go for it, sir.

740
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,600
Go for it.

741
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,510
- Sir.
- Go for it, sir.
