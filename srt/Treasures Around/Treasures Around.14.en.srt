(Strange.)

(Why is Qipei Pavilion's technique)

25
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,140
(so similar to the Crown?)

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,420
(Such high aesthetics.)

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,650
(How could it be trampled underfoot)

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,390
(by Suyu Pavilion for so many years?)

29
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,060
(Unless it was drawn
from the real thing.)

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,650
(How could it be so detailed)

31
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,500
(in anatomical drawings?)

32
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,310
Mr. Pei.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,060
Ms. Shuangshuang,
what are you looking for?

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,030
You can ask me directly
if you have any questions.

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm sorry. It was my rudeness.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,030
Young Master,
it's not Ms. Shuangshuang's fault.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
Ms. Shuangshuang wanted to study,

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
so I brought her here.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,750
Don't blame Ms. Shuangshuang.

40
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,190
You're frowning again. Are you angry?

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,470
Don't frown. You'll look less handsome.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,090
Ms. Shuangshuang this.

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,520
Ms. Shuangshuang that.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
Seems like I've spoiled you

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,900
too much.

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,650
Young Master, I'm sorry.

47
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,430
I asked Liu to bring my sister here.

48
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,220
Taking all the blame.

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,380
Even lying.

50
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,370
Do you know what this place is?

51
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,710
How can you bring outsiders here?

52
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,340
Outsiders?

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,750
What's wrong with him today?

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,580
(Pei's Mansion)

55
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,140
(Peace and Tranquility)

56
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,190
Haven't reconciled with Mr. Pei yet?

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,470
Reconcile? Only if he comes to me.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,620
This was my mistake.

59
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,750
Every family has its privacy,

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,340
especially since he's your boss.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,870
We servants must learn

62
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,820
to lower our heads.

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,620
Shuangshuang,

64
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,780
I have something to tell you.

65
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,310
Actually, I'm with Mr. Pei now.

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,190
We just haven't told anyone yet.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,380
When did this happen?

68
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,170
So many things happened,

69
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,750
and we ended up together.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,870
Would you oppose it?

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,790
As long as you're happy,

72
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,910
of course, I won't oppose it.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,500
But do you really know Mr. Pei?

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,350
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

75
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,770
Shuangshuang, don't worry.

76
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,810
Though he usually

77
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,130
seems carefree,

78
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,700
he is actually very responsible.

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,810
Since you're a couple now,

80
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,430
there's no need to be angry at him.

81
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,380
But be careful.

82
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,790
Don't fall too deep.

83
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,110
Trust my judgment, Shuangshuang.

84
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,380
Alright, sit down.

85
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,620
Young Master,

86
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,900
it's my fault for taking the library key

87
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,420
and making a decision
without your consent.

88
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,660
That's why you two are arguing.

89
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,540
Please don't be mad at her.

90
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,420
I did say something harsh.

91
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,140
I'll apologize to her later.

92
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,820
Young Master,

93
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,580
someone delivered a letter for you.

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,500
You were falsely accused of plagiarism
during the Jade Competition.

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,980
If you want to clear your name,
let's meet at Flower Pavilion.

96
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Who sent it?

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,860
I don't know. He left at once.

98
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,540
- Young Master.
- Cuiliu?

99
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Why are you here?

100
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,700
Young Master, I...

101
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,220
Young Master, don't go, please.

102
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,380
Young Master,

103
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,940
I know you don't want to see me.

104
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,500
I was bewitched by bad people

105
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,140
and did something stupid.

106
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,540
I deserved to be kicked
out of the Pei family.

107
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,860
But Young Master,

108
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,580
I really know I was wrong.

109
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,300
I've been punished.

110
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,180
I did those despicable things

111
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,780
out of jealousy.

112
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm jealous that
Dandan could be by your side.

113
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,300
Young Master, I know I was wrong.

114
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,860
Please forgive me.

115
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,700
- Please forgive me, Young Master.
- Fine.

116
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,580
It's good that you know your mistake.

117
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,420
I can change. I definitely can.

118
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,020
I'm no longer part of the Pei family.

119
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,620
I've given up on you.

120
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,740
Tomorrow, I'll leave for my hometown

121
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,460
to be with my parents,

122
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,260
get married, have children,

123
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,820
and live the rest of my life.

124
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,180
Today, I came

125
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,540
to see you one last time

126
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,140
and serve you one last time.

127
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Let me pour you one last drink

128
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,500
and make you one last cup of tea.

129
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,940
Young Master,

130
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,620
this might be

131
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,180
our last meeting.

132
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,060
Alright.

133
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,700
I have things to do. I'll head back.

134
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,660
Young Master, breakfast is ready.

135
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,860
Young Master, breakfast is ready.

136
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,540
Still angry, huh?

137
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,140
Young Master, breakfast!

138
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,780
Young Master!

139
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,540
Where is he?

140
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,740
I was going to ask you the same.

141
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,620
Liu,

142
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,380
where's Young Master?

143
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,260
He received a letter yesterday

144
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
and then rushed out.

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,700
He hasn't come back all night?

146
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
Where did he go?

147
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,900
How would I know?

148
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,140
Where did he go?

149
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,180
Flower Pavilion.

150
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,340
Wait for me, Dandan.

151
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,500
Take care.

152
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,100
So early today?

153
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,500
What's up?

154
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,780
Where's Pei Pei?

155
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,340
Where's Pei Pei?

156
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,700
Upstairs, in the private room.

157
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,580
I was only paid for the room.

158
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,180
What?

159
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,940
What's wrong with you?

160
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,460
What's with this?

161
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,820
Jerk!

162
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,740
You ruined me.

163
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,660
Jerk!

164
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,860
Young Master.

165
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,060
What's wrong, Young Master?

166
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,420
Wake up, Young Master.

167
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,420
- Young Master, wake up.
- Move.

168
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,540
Look at me, Young Master.

169
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,820
Young Master, wake up. Get up.

170
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,780
Take him away. Move.

171
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,180
Get up. Move.

172
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,380
- What's happening, officer?
- Move.

173
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,620
Get up.

174
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,540
Careful, officer.

175
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,180
Still not eating?

176
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,060
Dandan, eat something.

177
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
I have no appetite.

178
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
Dandan,

179
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
eat a little.

180
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,860
I don't think

181
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,700
Young Master would
cheat on you with Cuiliu.

182
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,460
Cuiliu is crafty.

183
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,340
Don't believe her.

184
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,580
I'm mad at the idiot.

185
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,420
How could he fall for her trick?

186
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,820
Why didn't he tell us before he went out?

187
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,380
And Cuiliu.

188
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,500
She's liked him for a long time.

189
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,900
Why would she harm him?

190
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,900
Even the prettiest dragonfly

191
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,500
can't fly without wings.

192
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,140
Jue,

193
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,900
three days later, he'll be interrogated.

194
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,100
This time, Pei really can't get away.

195
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,260
Indeed.

196
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,500
Coincidentally,

197
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,220
a girl appeared at this critical moment,

198
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,660
giving him a hard time.

199
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,340
Coincidentally?

200
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,900
Young Master, she's here.

201
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,380
Congratulations on getting out of prison.

202
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,380
You...

203
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,180
You're Mr. Su.

204
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,580
I heard about your situation.

205
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,740
It's not your fault.

206
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,820
You should blame that unfaithful Pei Pei

207
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,380
and the unruly Shan Dandan.

208
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,420
They forced you to make a grave mistake.

209
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,900
Do you hate them?

210
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,220
Yes.

211
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,020
If you don't mind,
come to Suyu Pavilion.

212
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,660
As long as you're willing to cooperate,

213
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,260
I guarantee you wealth and glory.

214
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,140
What?

215
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,420
Do you know why
you were released so quickly?

216
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,020
It was you?

217
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,900
You and I were both wronged.

218
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,180
Don't you want to make those two

219
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,380
suffer?

220
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,860
Or do you want

221
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,660
to end up on the streets?

222
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,180
What do you want me to do?

223
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,220
Good move, using her against Pei Pei.

224
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,780
It's his fault.

225
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,500
He wasn't careful

226
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,900
to have so many people resent him.

227
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,380
Jue, you finally get it.

228
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,580
That's right.

229
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,660
Don't punish yourself
for others' mistakes.

230
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,740
He sowed the seeds.

231
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,220
He should get what he deserves.

232
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,620
You're right.

233
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,140
If there were no Qipei Pavilion,

234
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,980
where would she go?

235
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,300
So now if I ask you for money,

236
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,380
you must give it to me.

237
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,780
If not to bribe the guards,

238
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,620
how can we

239
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,820
make Mr. Pei suffer?

240
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,140
Liu.

241
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,780
What are you doing?

242
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,300
Young Master must have been wronged.

243
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,260
I can't just stand by.

244
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,180
I need to save him.

245
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,060
Do you know what a serious crime
prison raid is?

246
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,660
Even if Mr. Pei is innocent,

247
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,380
your actions will put him in more danger.

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,300
So what should I do now?

249
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,220
What should I do?

250
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,980
We'll all think of a way together.

251
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,620
At this moment, we must not panic.

252
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,380
Alright.

253
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,660
I understand.

254
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,180
I'll need your help

255
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,580
to look after Ms. Dandan.

256
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,660
This incident hit her the hardest.

257
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,700
Of course.

258
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,700
Shopkeeper Hao,

259
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,540
no matter the cost,

260
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
try your best

261
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,620
to make connections.

262
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,700
Madam.

263
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,420
The best lawyer is on the way.

264
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,220
If you want to see him,
it'll be after midnight.

265
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,980
Thank you, officer.

266
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
Madam.

267
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,140
Dandan.

268
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,180
- Pei, he...
- I believe him.

269
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,060
I don't believe
he would do such a vile thing.

270
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,540
If he coveted Cuiliu,

271
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,940
why wait until now?

272
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
Madam,

273
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,620
don't worry.

274
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,340
The most important thing now

275
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,180
is to get him out.

276
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,740
Dandan,

277
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,900
I truly didn't misjudge you.

278
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,860
If you need money,

279
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,740
go to Shopkeeper Hao directly.

280
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,500
We'll do whatever it takes

281
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,500
to save Pei.

282
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,060
And you.

283
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,340
No matter what happens,

284
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,340
be cautious.

285
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,660
Stay safe.

286
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,420
Madam,

287
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,620
don't worry.

288
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,380
I won't let you down.

289
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,100
Trust me.

290
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,540
(Prison, Yuncui City)

291
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm here to see Pei Pei
of Qipei Pavilion.

292
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,900
Thank you.

293
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Let's go.

294
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
He's inside.

295
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,660
- Only for 15 minutes.
- Okay.

296
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,420
Pei Pei?

297
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,540
Pei Pei.

298
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,380
Dandan.

299
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,660
Dandan.

300
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,660
What happened?

301
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,780
Why are you beaten like this?

302
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,140
Does it hurt?

303
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,500
No.

304
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,740
Why did they beat you?

305
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,020
They wanted me to confess.

306
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,820
Of course, I didn't.

307
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,260
So...

308
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,140
They shouldn't beat you anyway.

309
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,980
- Don't cry.
- I know.

310
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,180
I know you were tricked by Cuiliu.

311
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,820
I'll find a way to prove your innocence.

312
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,620
Sorry.

313
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm so stupid,

314
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
making you sad.

315
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,060
How did it come to this?

316
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,540
Don't cry.

317
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,860
Hang in there.

318
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,180
I'll get you out.

319
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,820
I believe in you.

320
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,220
What?

321
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,060
They dared to torture the young master?

322
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,700
The priority is

323
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,420
to find evidence
and prove his innocence.

324
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,740
The sooner, the better.

325
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,020
But besides us,

326
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,300
how do we prove he was wronged?

327
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,420
Dandan.

328
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,540
What did you find?

329
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,780
They've checked.

330
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,540
They said the wine had no problem.

331
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,380
Of course.

332
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,300
If she really tampered with it,

333
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,900
it would've been cleaned up by now.

334
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Besides Cuiliu,

335
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,420
who else entered the room?

336
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Madam Yang said
it was just the two of them.

337
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,940
Cuiliu has long admired the young master.

338
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,100
If he really did something to her,

339
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,500
she would be happy,

340
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,740
instead of acting like that.

341
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,340
Why did she call the young master
to Flower Pavilion?

342
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,980
Who instructed her?

343
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,300
Who reported to the authorities?

344
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,220
There are too many doubts.

345
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,060
Dandan, you must save the young master.

346
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,260
Let me see it too.

347
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,020
(Now that Pei Chufeng
is no longer alive,)

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,340
(if Pei Pei is wrongfully imprisoned,)

349
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
(I won't be able
to investigate the Crown theft)

350
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,420
(from years ago.)

351
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,540
Shuangshuang, what's wrong?

352
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,060
Nothing.

353
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,980
Let's think of a way to save him.

354
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,940
Your Lordship,

355
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,420
(Xuanzheng Hall)
tomorrow is the trial for Pei Pei's case.

356
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,100
Su Jue paid the fine for Cuiliu

357
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,260
and kept her in Yuncui City.

358
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,100
This case is indeed suspicious.

359
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,580
Pei Pei has always been of good character.

360
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,500
He wouldn't do this

361
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,580
unless he's been possessed.

362
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,140
You're right, Your Lordship.

363
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,140
We can't conclude based solely

364
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,260
on Cuiliu's words.

365
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,740
Pei Pei made a mistake,

366
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,820
being manipulated
by Cuiliu multiple times.

367
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,820
Have you arranged everyone?

368
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,260
The midwife is ready.

369
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,540
The Pei family knows how to respond.

370
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,020
Tomorrow's trial should reveal the truth.

371
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,140
The Su family is becoming bolder.

372
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,210
We'll teach Su Jue a little lesson

373
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,060
through Pei Pei's case.

374
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,540
The Pei family contributed greatly
to the poison bracelet case.

375
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,380
Besides,

376
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,700
we can punish those

377
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,620
who distort the truth
and fabricate stories.

378
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,500
Go handle it quickly.

379
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,900
Yes, Your Lordship.

380
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,420
(Pei's Mansion)

381
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,620
If Suyu Pavilion indeed bribed Cuiliu

382
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,460
to frame the young master,

383
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,780
this would be troublesome.

384
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,780
The Su family's influence is immense.

385
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,860
They will cover all traces.

386
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,740
Ms. Shuangshuang,

387
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,140
you worked at Suyu Pavilion.

388
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,140
Do they really hate
the young master this much?

389
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,420
Well...

390
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,460
It's possible.

391
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,820
Such despicable people.

392
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,700
When they can't compete,

393
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,820
they resort to underhanded tricks.

394
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,380
I want to raid Suyu Pavilion right now.

395
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,220
I'll confront them.

396
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,190
Calm down.

397
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,540
Now is not the time to be impulsive.

398
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,140
The most important thing
is to rescue him.

399
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,980
Deputy Shopkeeper, you wanted to see me?

400
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,740
Hongyu, I need to ask you something.

401
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,460
Please answer truthfully.

402
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,060
(Guangju Tavern)

403
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,420
(Guangju Tavern)

404
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,260
Has Cuiliu ever had a lover?

405
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,860
No.

406
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,700
Did she ever

407
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,780
behave improperly with the young master?

408
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,020
Though Cuiliu is somewhat unruly,

409
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,500
she has long admired the young master.

410
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,900
She's inherently traditional.

411
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,060
She wouldn't do such things.

412
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
I see.

413
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,100
Hongyu,

414
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,060
take me to Cuiliu's room.

415
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,900
Yes.

416
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,580
Liu,

417
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,700
go to the City Lord,

418
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,020
tell him we have new evidence,

419
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,340
and request a retrial.

420
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,860
- Understood.
- Also,

421
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,620
keep a close watch on Cuiliu.

422
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,380
Make sure nothing happens to her

423
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,060
before the City Lord calls for her.

424
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,460
Got it.

425
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,260
With the key witness Cuiliu found,

426
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,740
(Xuanzheng Hall)
here's the trial for Pei Pei.

427
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,380
Bring Pei Pei in.

428
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,460
Why is Pei Pei injured like this?

429
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,060
He was uncooperative
and refused to confess,

430
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,340
so he was punished.

431
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,700
Your Lordship, Pei Pei is innocent.

432
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,940
Innocent? How so?

433
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,860
That day, I was drugged,

434
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,780
barely conscious.

435
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,500
Today, I can finally speak.

436
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,820
I received an anonymous letter,

437
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,220
saying it could clear my name

438
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,220
in the Jade Competition scandal.

439
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,740
Of course.

440
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,500
Your Lordship, you might not believe

441
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,540
I was framed.

442
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,980
When I arrived at Flower Pavilion,

443
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,620
I found Cuiliu waiting there,

444
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,580
saying she wanted to apologize.

445
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,620
After drinking her wine,

446
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,580
I remembered nothing.

447
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,300
Your Lordship, here's the evidence.

448
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,180
Please take a look.

449
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,660
Young Master, heavens!

450
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,260
How could you say such shameless things?

451
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,940
You pretended to be drunk

452
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,540
and defiled me.

453
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,020
How can you wrongfully accuse me?

454
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,500
I think you're the shameless one.

455
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,620
You claim the young master

456
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,340
did something vile to you,

457
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,540
what exactly did he do?

458
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,740
Can you tell us in detail?

459
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,580
I...

460
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,140
I...

461
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,460
Why? Speechless now?

462
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,460
Let me help you.

463
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,540
Your Lordship,

464
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,100
I request the midwife
to assist in the investigation.

465
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,940
Granted.

466
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,540
Greetings, Your Lordship.

467
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,180
This is a renowned midwife
in Yuncui City,

468
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,900
expert at determining
if a woman is a virgin.

469
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,260
She has never failed.

470
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,020
Since Cuiliu claims such a great insult,

471
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,300
let's verify

472
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,820
the extent of her injury.

473
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,420
Yes.

474
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,620
Come.

475
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,460
Let me go!

476
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,740
I only said

477
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,140
the young master kissed

478
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,220
and touched me.

479
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,380
Absurd!

480
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,740
Can only extreme acts be counted as vile?

481
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,140
No matter what,

482
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,620
the young master still harassed me.

483
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,700
Cuiliu,

484
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,260
I know

485
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,380
about you and Su Jue.

486
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,380
The villain is already struggling.

487
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,660
Do you think

488
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,620
bringing up the Su family will save you?

489
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,380
Do you think
the Su family will let you go?

490
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,340
Your Lordship,

491
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,500
this may involve...

492
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,340
It was me.

493
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,460
I did it.

494
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,340
I couldn't stand that wretch being happy,

495
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,620
so I did this.

496
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,980
Outrageous!

497
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
In the perfume case,

498
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,860
I showed leniency
because you were coerced

499
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,820
and the Pei family pleaded.

500
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,340
I didn't give you a heavy sentence,

501
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,060
yet you haven't repented

502
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,300
and have worsened.

503
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,180
Guards, take her away!

504
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,540
Your Lordship, spare me!

505
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,700
- Your Lordship!
- Move.

506
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,660
I was wrong.

507
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,420
I was truly wrong.

508
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,980
Let me go!

509
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,860
Your Lordship,

510
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,460
can I take the young master home now?

511
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,580
Yes.

512
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,820
Be careful.

513
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,980
Slowly.

514
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,140
Come on.

515
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
Here.

516
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,740
Watch your wound.

517
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,660
It doesn't hurt.

518
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,460
Thank you

519
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,220
for being so considerate

520
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,500
this time.

521
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
I know.

522
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,140
You don't want your mother to worry,

523
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,060
so I had to ensure you

524
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,460
return with dignity.

525
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,540
Does the wound still hurt?

526
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,300
It doesn't.

527
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,060
That day,

528
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,340
in the library,

529
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,780
I spoke harshly

530
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,420
out of impulse.

531
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,420
Sorry.

532
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,540
It's nothing.

533
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,260
I was a bit reckless too.

534
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
We're even.

535
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,020
Were you angry

536
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,140
about the Cuiliu incident at first?

537
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,140
At first,

538
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,380
I was furious,

539
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,380
wondering how you could be so foolish.

540
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,100
But I only stayed angry for a while.

541
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Then I just wanted

542
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,660
to get you out, no matter what.

543
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,140
I can't lose you.

544
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,780
Dandan,

545
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,740
when I was in prison,

546
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,340
I was terrified.

547
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,300
Not of punishment

548
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,500
or death.

549
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,180
I was afraid

550
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,140
of never seeing you again.

551
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,340
Alright.

552
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,300
Don't think about that anymore.

553
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,060
You're seeing me now, aren't you?

554
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,460
And you'll see me every day from now on.

555
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,660
You said it.

556
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,060
Every day from now on.

557
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,220
Not a single day less.

558
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,940
Every day, indeed.

559
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,700
I love you.

560
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
I love you too.

561
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,300
(Pei's Mansion)

562
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,460
Madam, Madam!

563
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,260
- Liu.
- Young Master is back!

564
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,340
He's back!

565
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,700
- Ms. Li.
- Madam.

566
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,180
Pei!

567
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,380
Mother.

568
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,340
Pei!

569
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,860
You're back.

570
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,300
You've suffered.

571
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,220
Not really.

572
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,220
Dandan, you did it.

573
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,460
Go rest inside now.

574
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,420
Madam Pei, greetings.

575
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,260
What are you doing here?

576
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,700
I heard Pei was severely injured,

577
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,500
so I came to check on him.

578
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
Unexpectedly, he still looks vigorous.

579
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,820
All thanks to you.

580
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,340
What do you mean by that?

581
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,980
I don't understand.

582
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,340
I saw Cuiliu getting into your carriage.

583
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,660
You've been causing trouble

584
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,740
all along, haven't you?

585
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,900
That girl?

586
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,980
I saw her being thrown out,

587
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,060
so I took her in

588
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,340
out of pity.

589
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,020
As for what you're saying,

590
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,060
aren't you overthinking it?

591
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,180
Using such despicable methods,

592
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,740
there's no need to stir up trouble here.

593
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,780
Ms. Shuangshuang, how are you?

594
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,900
What's it to you?

595
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,540
Who are you

596
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,220
- to speak here?
- You...

597
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,020
Mr. Su, mind your own business.

598
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,420
You're not welcome here.

599
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,660
Liu, show him out.

600
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,780
Yes.

601
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,660
Mr. Su, please.

602
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,860
What's the hurry?

603
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,100
It will take you thirty years

604
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,500
to turn things around.

605
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,820
At least thirty years.

606
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,180
Mr. Pei,

607
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,660
don't lose too badly.

608
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,300
What a welcoming sight,
magpies at the door.

609
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,260
It seems we have an honored guest.

610
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,940
Here.

611
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,820
Mr. Su.

612
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Here.

613
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,220
Sit, Mr. Qin.

614
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,620
Is it convenient?

615
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,820
Thank you, Mr. Su.

616
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,860
Mr. Qin, you're smiling

617
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,180
quite ominously today.

618
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,340
What are you talking about?

619
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,540
The Jade Shop relies entirely on you.

620
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,500
Now, with the Pei family in trouble,

621
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,860
who doesn't treat you

622
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,580
as a master, Mr. Su?

623
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,820
Mr. Qin, let me ask you.

624
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,780
How often does your store

625
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,180
get new stock?

626
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,300
The journey is long.
Once every six months.

627
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,020
If I bought out

628
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,980
all your raw stones,

629
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,420
wouldn't others be unable to buy any?

630
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,740
If you bought all my stones,

631
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,940
thanks to you,

632
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,820
I'd be able to take a holiday.

633
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,020
Then I'll make it happen.

634
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,020
Thank you, Mr. Su.

635
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,940
You two, take your time.

636
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,900
I'll make arrangements.

637
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,460
Jue,

638
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,940
are you really going
to buy all the raw stones

639
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,820
in the area?

640
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,580
If you do,
our treasury will be nearly empty.

641
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,620
Think it through.

642
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,180
I've thought it through.

643
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,100
You're right.

644
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,380
Without the Qipei Pavilion,

645
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,300
where else can the beauty go?

646
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,940
This is a fight

647
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,860
to the death.

648
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,740
Yes.

649
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,780
Let's buy them all.

650
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,620
What do you mean?

651
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,140
Speak clearly.

652
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,940
Madam, Young Master.

653
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,780
Bad news!

654
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,700
What happened?

655
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,020
Suyu Pavilion suddenly
started selling goods at half price.

656
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,460
Our Qipei Pavilion's shops

657
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,380
are all deserted.

658
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,900
Then we'll reduce our prices by 30%.

659
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,500
I tried that for two days.

660
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,900
We sold some goods,

661
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,420
but Suyu Pavilion's wealth accumulated

662
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
over many years.

663
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,260
With such loss-making strategies,

664
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,820
we can't afford

665
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,020
this price war.

666
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,660
What's worse is...

667
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,740
Shopkeeper Hao, speak freely.

668
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,180
Suyu Pavilion bought out all the stores

669
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,060
with raw stone selling rights
around Yuncui City.

670
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,740
After our goods run out,

671
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,380
we'll struggle to restock.

672
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,060
Why do they buy so many raw stones?

673
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,500
Aren't they afraid of overstocking?

674
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900
Not at all.

675
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,340
Such a grand scheme.

676
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,420
They want to fight us to the death.

677
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,020
Whether they lose or not,

678
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,740
we're truly in trouble.

679
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,500
Seems having Pei suffer

680
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,540
was their ploy to lure us away.

681
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,380
The Su family planned this well.

682
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,220
How are the finances now?

683
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,620
I sold half our stock

684
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,260
at a low price,

685
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,180
but now,

686
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,220
we can't even pay the staff.

687
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,580
Aside from a few loyal workers,

688
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,700
many have asked to resign.

689
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,900
If we keep selling at a loss,

690
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,300
with no raw materials,

691
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,300
the Qipei Pavilion
will have nothing left.

692
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,340
What brings you here?

693
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,300
Don't you know our store is closed?

694
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,300
I know.

695
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,260
But why did you sell all your stones

696
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,940
to one jade store?

697
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,500
Ridiculous.

698
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,700
Suyu Pavilion has a huge business.

699
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,060
They came to me.

700
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,140
I couldn't refuse a sale.

701
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
If you had the money,

702
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,500
I'd sell to you first.

703
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,540
Do you have any stock left?

704
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,700
We really need it and will pay you well.

705
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,620
Sorry. None left.

706
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,740
Can you provide an outside source?

707
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
We'll share the profits

708
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,420
with you.

709
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,700
The mines are far away,

710
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,540
only supplying once every six months.

711
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,420
I can't help you.

712
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,580
Alright. Leave.

713
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,060
Don't ruin my holiday.

714
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,260
Right?

715
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,620
Why aren't you taking your medicine?

716
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,260
I don't want to.

717
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,900
You need it to get better.

718
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,220
