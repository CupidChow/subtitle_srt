00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:25,351
"Love Beneath the Stars"
(Episode 3)

2
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,812
Before we announce the winner,

3
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:32,300
let us call on our reigning
Queen for her final walk.

4
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:36,375
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Journey 2019.

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,812
Let's go!

6
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,142
A round of applause everyone.

7
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,554
Today, I take my final walk as your Queen.

8
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,015
And I would li...

9
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,402
And I would like to take this opportunity

10
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:52,187
to say to the young ones...

11
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:56,149
Here in Journey, love truly wins.

12
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,051
Because in this upcoming Grad Ball,

13
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:03,164
not only one but two queens
have found their soulmates.

14
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:07,195
Yes, sisters.

15
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,145
I am among one of them
and Dominic is the second.

16
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,151
This all happened because of
my reign as the Muse of Journey.

17
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,803
Because as they say,

18
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:19,489
"Let's manifest love

19
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,100
because we are love

20
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,578
and we all deserve to be loved!"

21
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,796
And I...

22
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,206
thank you!

23
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,296
- Thank you!
- Yes!

24
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,569
I love you sister!

25
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:33,617
Okay.

26
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:36,422
The votes have been casted.

27
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,875
And the winner

28
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:42,060
of Miss Journey 2020

29
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:45,007
is none other than...

30
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,153
Cas!

31
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,453
Oh my god.

32
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:54,613
- How cute are they?
- I know, right?

33
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:57,835
Next year, they'll take over.

34
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,015
True!

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,391
I can't believe we're graduating
in a month's time.

36
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,200
True!

37
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,560
I hope we all go to the same college.

38
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:07,328
Of course.

39
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,475
We will still be together
through college,

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,592
I know I'm sure.

41
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:11,739
But I don't know about Timmy.

42
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:12,765
Sis!

43
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,975
That's why we have to make
the extra effort to create

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,898
beautiful memories for
our last days in high school.

45
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,231
Let's start with the Grad Ball!

46
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,289
Two weeks left!

47
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:22,562
We must be fabulous.

48
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:26,215
The fact that you and Dominic
will both have dates

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,366
is already a showstopper.

50
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,389
- True!
- Sis!

51
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:31,036
The greatest event of 2020!

52
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,271
Yes!

53
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,721
Guys, we're keeping it
on the down-low.

54
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:38,445
Don't want unwanted attention.

55
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,861
By the way,

56
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,225
the first sign already happened!

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,865
What?

58
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,414
Or who?

59
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,451
Luke was the first sign.

60
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,154
- Oh my god.
- What?! Spill!

61
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,859
Sis, how?

62
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:51,583
Secret.

63
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:52,984
Damn it.

64
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,289
Did we really have to be this early?

65
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:59,187
Sorry. It's just that
I have to be at practice later.

66
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,597
Sometimes I wonder what my job really is.

67
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,343
Fortune-teller or guidance counselor!

68
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,773
Jopay! Bring me coffee!

69
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,757
So, why are you here?

70
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:14,529
I just want to know

71
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:19,890
if I can ask for additional
readings for the second sign.

72
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:22,328
Why?

73
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,570
I don't want to screw it up with Dominic.

74
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:30,164
Thank your lucky stars
I ship you both.

75
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,976
Okay, cut the cards.

76
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:01,890
What was the second sign again?

77
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,148
Sun and Lovers.

78
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:07,668
Hmm.

79
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,660
It says here that
you need to really think about

80
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,101
pushing through with this sign or not.

81
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,601
Wait.

82
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,953
What do you mean? It involves me again?

83
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,156
It seems like it.

84
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,390
Didn't you say you were the first sign?

85
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,304
This is it, right?

86
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:25,945
Yes.

87
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,312
Do you see this, two of swords?

88
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,796
Two swords pointing opposite directions.

89
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:39,757
One is pointing to the Lovers
but it's beside the Hanged Man.

90
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,635
The other sword is pointing
to Death and the Ten of Coins.

91
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:51,187
This means you and Dominic
will have to make a choice.

92
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,688
Either you continue your relationship

93
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,828
in the face of unexpected problems.

94
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:03,585
And the other choice is,

95
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:09,085
you end your relationship
and achieve success.

96
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,734
Love or success?

97
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,390
That's what you need to decide.

98
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:29,894
- Sir, one Jasmine tea, large.
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,085
Thank you.

100
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:38,689
Karen?

101
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:42,933
Hi Auntie.

102
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:53,013
Luke told me you guys broke up.

103
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,476
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,906
Why are you apologizing?

105
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,179
I was the one who broke up with him first.

106
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,601
You guys didn't try to fix it?

107
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,343
I did.

108
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,773
But it was too late.

109
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:15,220
Why?

110
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:19,734
He's...

111
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:25,554
He's in love with someone else.

112
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,969
I saw them hugging,

113
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:38,482
- like, really...
- Coach. Coach.

114
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:39,515
Coach!

115
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,955
I'm sorry. I'm not late, right?

116
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:48,414
Luke,

117
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,304
let's talk downstairs.

118
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,015
I know I said I don't care
what you guys do outside training.

119
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:06,210
But this is different.

120
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:12,703
Luke, answer my question.

121
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:16,383
Are you gay?

122
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,554
You know what Luke,

123
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,283
what's important to me is that
you look out for your future.

124
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,046
Everyone knows you're my favorite.

125
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:55,312
Not because you're good,

126
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:01,725
but because you are
hardworking and passionate.

127
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,132
But I don't want you to jeopardize
what you've worked so hard for

128
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,968
because you were seen
cuddling with a man.

129
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,231
Someone takes a picture,
uploads it on social media...

130
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:14,288
you're finished.

131
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,232
Luke, remember,

132
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:22,618
there are no gay basketball players.

133
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:31,685
I know you and Philip have issues.

134
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,898
But I am thankful that he told me this.

135
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:36,867
He cares about you.

136
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:38,970
He knows how important

137
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,101
the college scholarship
is to you and your mother.

138
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,845
Think about that, Luke.

139
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,453
Think about the sacrifices
your mother made.

140
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,789
Think about your future.

141
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:52,257
Got it?

142
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,570
Got it, Coach.

143
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:15,382
(Dominic calling...)

144
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,970
Who knew we had
a place like this in school.

145
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,079
It's beautiful.

146
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,316
Who found this?

147
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,203
I don't know with Dominic.
Wandering all the time.

148
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,687
But there's nothing here.

149
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,484
So good luck with
the rentals and suppliers.

150
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,507
- Leave that to us.
- Yes, sister.

151
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,276
Anyway, do we have your approval?

152
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,109
As long as it fits the budget.

153
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:12,740
Because if it's not, it's on you.

154
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,844
Auntie Faye can take care of that.

155
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,093
Right, sis?

156
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:18,203
Hey, you okay?

157
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:21,960
- Hey!
- Oh!

158
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,474
Huh?

159
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:24,334
You okay?

160
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:29,554
You've been staring
at your phone for a while.

161
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,757
Sorry, I was just thinking.

162
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,539
How's Auntie Faye?

163
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:35,929
It's not family related.

164
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,914
So it's Luke?

165
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:40,117
What are you talking about?

166
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:44,132
I saw you two hugging after F-night.

167
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,078
You don't have to explain anything.

168
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,414
I got everything based on what I saw.

169
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,554
So what's his problem?

170
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,600
I've been calling him the past two days.

171
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,882
He's not answering me.

172
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,359
Maybe he's sick.

173
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:02,644
I wish he'd tell me.

174
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:05,351
- I mean, I'm his...
- His what?

175
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,437
Anyway,

176
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:14,101
I'm going to go ahead. I really...

177
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:15,637
I really can't focus.

178
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:18,929
Hey, sis! Dominic! Where are you going?

179
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,682
Have they been dating for long?

180
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:23,843
No, just recently.

181
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,335
Let's go, Pres.

182
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:27,890
We're coming, Miguel.

183
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,007
Here, your Highness.

184
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,063
Nice!

185
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,843
Hey!

186
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:39,701
These are mine.

187
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,600
Hey, you're not allowed in here.

188
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,987
No fags allowed.

189
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,117
I'm not here for you.

190
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,691
What you're looking for isn't here.

191
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:48,717
Cut it out.

192
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:51,390
Don't tell me you're defending the homo!

193
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:52,617
Defending?

194
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,288
There's nothing to defend

195
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:55,501
because there's no fight happening.

196
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,986
He's the problem. That fag!

197
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:57,976
Faggot!

198
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,507
I am gay.

199
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:01,431
Yuck!

200
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:04,125
Let's talk outside.

201
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,324
I'm sorry for this idiot.

202
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,029
That's not an idiot. He's an asshole!

203
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,619
Stay away from my friends.

204
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,218
He hasn't been to school in two days.

205
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,514
Is he okay?

206
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:20,023
He's not replying.

207
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,679
Last time he did that was when
you guys pressured him to avoid me.

208
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,140
Sorry about that.

209
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:30,070
I mean, we didn't know
that he fell in love with you.

210
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:33,976
Why're you shocked?

211
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,828
He told me that he loves you.

212
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,721
Philip just can't accept it,
that's why he told Coach.

213
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:42,905
What?

214
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,265
Was he kicked out of the team?

215
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:47,435
No idea.

216
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,867
Coach just said to leave him alone,

217
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:52,992
he needs time to think.

218
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,635
Philip's such an asshole.

219
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,984
Well, you're not wrong.

220
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,434
He's just like that.

221
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,002
Very protective of his friends.

222
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:06,810
I'm not defending him or anything.

223
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,625
But he's just wired that way.

224
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:13,203
Maybe in time, he will understand.

225
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,312
Hopefully.

226
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:18,320
And you?

227
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,726
I'm trying my best.

228
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:27,109
Got to go.

229
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:40,020
Sometimes...

230
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,275
No, most of the time, guys
are bigger gossips than we are.

231
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,944
True, sis. Especially the ugly ones.

232
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,687
They're the best at spreading lies.

233
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:52,074
True. A bunch of bored frogs.

234
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,334
- Actually.
- Sis.

235
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,611
I don't know what to do anymore.

236
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,146
Calm down, sis.

237
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,420
How?!

238
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,316
What if his coach told him
to stay away from me?

239
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:01,133
What am I supposed to do?

240
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:03,570
That's most likely what happened.

241
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,162
Not helping.

242
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,891
But, there's nothing you can do.

243
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,484
It's Luke's choice if he wants
to listen to his coach or not.

244
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,492
I know, but still...

245
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,335
I hope it's not like that.

246
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,060
He's only been gay a few weeks...
gave up so easy.

247
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,838
But is he gay, that's the question.

248
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:25,217
Okay, fine. Maybe bi-sexual?

249
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:28,443
Or pansexual or Dominic-sexual?

250
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:29,412
Stop it.

251
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:33,076
In the realm of LGBTQIA+.

252
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:35,559
We all know it's not easy.

253
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:36,806
Right?

254
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:38,457
So sis, give him time.

255
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,671
He'll talk when he's ready.

256
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,218
Do you want to go home?

257
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:47,445
How can we go home with him like that?

258
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,343
How much coffee did you drink?

259
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,781
What are you saying now, Gio?

260
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:18,210
I noticed you've been
so uneasy for a while now.

261
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:24,353
I just booked a taxi. He said
he'd be here in ten minutes.

262
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,328
It's already been fifteen.

263
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:29,468
Maybe he just got lost.

264
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:31,437
I mean, our school
is way up in the mountains.

265
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:33,921
Where are you headed anyway?

266
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:35,554
None of your business.

267
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,317
You don't have to snap at me.

268
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:41,801
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,771
But can't you see I'm preoccupied.

270
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,296
And you keep meddling.

271
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,014
I know you're just worried about Luke.

272
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,975
Frustration doesn't help.

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,078
It's just added stress.

274
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,570
Give me your hand.

275
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:58,859
This is what you're going to do.

276
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,319
Close your eyes

277
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,054
and inhale deeply,

278
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,390
then squeeze my hand.

279
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:05,634
For what?

280
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,140
Just do it.

281
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:16,015
Ouch!

282
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:17,164
I'm sorry!

283
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:19,508
Kidding!

284
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:23,304
See, you calmed down.

285
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:27,203
Cab's here.

286
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:38,838
I mean,

287
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:42,593
I know I should let him be

288
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:44,730
and give him time to think.

289
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:48,226
But I can't do it. I'm so confused.

290
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,011
I should start charging extra
for being a love guru.

291
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:57,226
I don't know if I'm Doctor Love
or Baby R anymore.

292
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,304
What do you mean?

293
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,195
You and Mr. Cutie!

294
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:03,828
You both come running to me

295
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,156
when there's trouble in paradise.

296
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:09,882
Luke was here?

297
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,315
Good for you.
He's pining for you.

298
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,122
Wow, very pretty!

299
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:19,823
He really wants to make
your relationship work.

300
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:22,210
So you should have some faith in him.

301
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:29,404
You know, I have a great
solution to your problem.

302
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:30,670
What?

303
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,570
Head over to his house!

304
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,453
I'm sure he's just there.

305
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,375
But...

306
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,693
No more buts!

307
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,842
Want me to slap you?

308
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:43,468
You want to speak to him, right?
And you don't know how?

309
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,062
Then, go straight to his house!

310
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,031
Think about it.

311
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:51,992
Okay, I have to go.
I have a date to get to.

312
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,862
Yaass.

313
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:54,781
You know it.

314
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,671
I have a life too you know.

315
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:20,141
(Dominic calling...)

316
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:23,844
Luke,

317
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:26,226
how are you feeling?

318
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,828
You want to go to the hospital?

319
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:31,609
No. No need.

320
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:34,929
I'm just exhausted from training.

321
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,914
That Dominic has been
calling you nonstop.

322
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,750
Why don't you answer it?

323
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:46,795
Uhm.

324
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,609
I'll call him later.

325
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,451
Call him already.

326
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,796
I'm sure he's worried about you.

327
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,258
Huh?

328
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,905
He's the one you're in love with, right?

329
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,921
Why are you looking at me like that?

330
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:12,886
I'm right, aren't I?

331
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,223
Luke,

332
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,461
it doesn't matter to me who you love.

333
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,601
As long the person you love
makes you happy.

334
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:32,382
If that person is Dominic, then go!

335
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,296
But if he is the reason you're sad,

336
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,492
then we have a problem.

337
00:20:41,348 --> 00:20:42,224
No,

338
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,315
he's not the reason

339
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:48,125
but he's part of it.

340
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,874
Huh?

341
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:54,205
Just say it outright.

342
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,632
Coach Mark spoke to me two days ago.

343
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:05,035
Philip told him
he saw me hugging Dominic

344
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,507
during Journey with the Lord.

345
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,737
What's wrong with that?

346
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:14,093
He said I should stay away from Dominic

347
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:17,046
to avoid being in a scandal.

348
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,062
It's a crucial time for
recruitment to college teams.

349
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:25,140
He feels that if someone takes
a photo of me with Dominic,

350
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:27,511
it might lead to people thinking I'm...

351
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,286
You're what?

352
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:33,181
That I'm gay.

353
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,877
Well,

354
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:37,934
are you?

355
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:42,097
I don't know.

356
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,057
Maybe?

357
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,831
I don't know.

358
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,710
But all I know is that.

359
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:51,134
I'm in love with Dominic.

360
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,520
So what's the problem?

361
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:58,007
I don't want to be a burden to you.

362
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,436
I want to get into a team,
get my scholarship

363
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:03,995
so you don't have to worry about it.

364
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:14,806
I love you.

365
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,148
- You know that, right?
- Yes, I know.

366
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:21,372
And I love you, too.

367
00:22:21,397 --> 00:22:23,843
Then have faith in me!

368
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:28,156
Trust that I will do anything for you.

369
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,795
Don't think about the scholarship

370
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,273
if that's in the way of your happiness.

371
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,565
Because we're rich!

372
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:41,280
I can afford your college
without the scholarship.

373
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,313
- We're "rich"?
- Yes.

374
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:45,546
Huh?

375
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:51,890
I'm going to sell
the paintings of your Dad.

376
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,617
It's not like we need them.

377
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,921
But seriously,

378
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,233
I'm still the parent here.

379
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:10,468
Let me worry about your future.

380
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:14,454
Thank you, Mom.

381
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,429
No problem, son.

382
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:20,017
Don't mind Coach Mark.

383
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:24,404
I believe the schools will take you

384
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:25,984
not because you're straight,

385
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,929
but because you're a good player.

386
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,383
(Dominic calling...)

387
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,054
You should get that.

388
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:43,323
Hi Dominic.

389
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:45,023
Thank God, you picked up!

390
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,287
What? Why?

391
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:50,906
You live in
567 Dragonfruit street, right?

392
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:52,015
Yeah?

393
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:54,327
I think I'm here.

394
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,203
What?

395
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:28,945
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:37,223
I know you've been worried about me.

397
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:38,640
I really am sorry.

398
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:46,578
This is your fault.
You weren't answering my calls.

399
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:50,596
Are you crying?

400
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:52,690
Just a bit.

401
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,289
Sorry, did I ruin the moment?

402
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:13,429
Hi Mrs. Armada.

403
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:15,531
Hi.

404
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,456
Is this Dominic?

405
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:22,562
Yes, Mom.

406
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,789
This is Dominic.

407
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,288
My...

408
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,450
My boyfriend.

409
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:06,101
Dominic, be honest with me.

410
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,936
Do you love my son?

411
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:08,757
What?!

412
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:09,857
Boyfriend?!

413
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:11,492
Oh my god! Spill!

414
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:13,381
It's Grad Ball this weekend.

415
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,267
Don't do anything stupid.

416
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,328
Just always remember this, Dominic.

417
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,210
You deserve to be happy.
