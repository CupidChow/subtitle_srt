"Love Beneath the Stars"
(Episode 2)

2
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,149
To be honest...

3
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,321
I don't know why I'm here.

4
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,681
Luke told me yesterday.

5
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,079
May I slap you?

6
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:03,251
What?

7
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:05,981
I said,

8
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,321
may I slap you?

9
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,440
If it helps...

10
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,596
then it's okay.

11
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,179
Wow.

12
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,829
You're really a martyr.

13
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,544
I've thought of so many scenarios

14
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,657
about what I'd do when I see you.

15
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,212
Shoving you on the street

16
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,149
and make it go viral on social media.

17
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:49,431
But now that I'm here,

18
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:51,741
and you're there.

19
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,462
It's so difficult for me to be angry.

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,099
I don't think I'll be able to say anything

21
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,978
that will make you feel better.

22
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,728
But I want you to know that I love Luke.

23
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,829
And I'm willing to fight for him.

24
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:23,177
Well, don't worry, Dominic.
I'm not like that.

25
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,714
I have self-respect.

26
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,313
And I won't chase after a boy...

27
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,899
who doesn't love me anymore.

28
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,017
You sure?

29
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:54,387
No.

30
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:56,698
But I guess,

31
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:00,103
I have to keep telling myself until...

32
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,563
I finally accept it.

33
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:28,907
Dad, your keys.

34
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,142
Son,

35
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,837
I heard from you Aunt Wilma that
Grad Ball is coming up soon?

36
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,071
So, who are you going with?

37
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:40,533
No one.

38
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:42,184
Just with Timmy and Miguel.

39
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,050
Why?

40
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,014
It's Grad Ball.

41
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,118
You won't have that when
you get to college.

42
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:51,220
Why not invite Trisha?

43
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,524
I'm busy with the decorations committee.

44
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,384
No time for dates.

45
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,898
Are you sure?

46
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,079
- Trisha is such a pretty girl.
- Don't force him anymore.

47
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:05,634
Fine.

48
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,066
How are your grades?

49
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,610
Still First Honors?

50
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:10,710
Yes, Mommy.

51
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,954
Dominic, you promised us

52
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,772
that this time you'll be valedictorian.

53
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,892
In grade school,

54
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,647
you were just the salutatorian.

55
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:22,213
Stop stressing the boy out.

56
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,499
Let's go.

57
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:23,995
Okay.

58
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,055
Give Mommy a kiss.

59
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,541
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

60
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:29,173
- Take it easy.
- Take care.

61
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,399
Hi Mom.

62
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,296
Oh.

63
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:41,532
Hi, son.

64
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,931
Did practice end late?

65
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:45,648
Yeah, there was a tune up game
with the team from Ateneo.

66
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:48,259
Coach Mark set it up
for the college scouts.

67
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,540
Wow.

68
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,228
Coach is pretty cool.

69
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,274
Handsome and kind.

70
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,386
Is he single?

71
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:56,399
Ma!

72
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,042
I'm kidding.

73
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:02,885
I'm just happy because
he takes care of you guys.

74
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,431
He thinks about your future.

75
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,110
Yeah, he's a great coach.

76
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:12,682
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,558
Taping for my new series is non-stop.

78
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,554
I don't get to spend
that much time with you.

79
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,532
No, it's okay. I understand.

80
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,260
What did I do to deserve you?

81
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:23,407
You know,

82
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:24,860
I believe that's...

83
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,032
Karen's influence on you.

84
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,157
You hit the jackpot.

85
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,657
Actually...

86
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,672
We broke up already.

87
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,048
I'm sorry,

88
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:41,681
I didn't know.

89
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:43,312
How are you?

90
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,868
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

91
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,188
Don't worry about me.

92
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,509
Actually,

93
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,184
I do have a problem at school.

94
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,151
Oh.

95
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,853
You fought with Philip?

96
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:16,523
Yes.

97
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,790
I was protecting someone I care about.

98
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:28,790
Okay,

99
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,572
I won't ask.

100
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,353
But don't let it happen again.

101
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,401
Promise?

102
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:39,579
Promise.

103
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,110
I love you, son.

104
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,540
When you're ready, I'm just here.

105
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,808
Beer?

106
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,353
Ma! I still have a practice game.

107
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,017
Okay.

108
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:29,720
Hi!

109
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:38,374
Hi!

110
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,478
Stop it.

111
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,934
Why don't you talk to me
outside Grad Ball meetings?

112
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:51,095
Gio, let's not pretend
we're still friends.

113
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,149
We haven't spoken in
three years, even in school.

114
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,196
You haven't forgiven me?

115
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,095
I forgave you a long time ago.

116
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,382
I actually forgot about it.

117
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,681
Oh okay,

118
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,675
so that means I can make it up to you?

119
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Why?

120
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,503
Aren't you busy being
student body president?

121
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,838
Well, we're workmates now.

122
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:20,392
I'm not comfortable working
with someone who's mad at me.

123
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,868
That's the only reason?

124
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,221
Yes.

125
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:29,632
I want a work-friendly environment.

126
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:35,493
Fine.

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,657
Just stop being annoying.

128
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,087
Promise.

129
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,749
I'll just sit here.

130
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:42,946
Quietly.

131
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,017
I'll just watch you.

132
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:53,415
Whatever.

133
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,196
Most of the time,

134
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,243
people associate love as a feeling.

135
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:01,785
But falling in love is not love.

136
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,728
According to Scott Peck,

137
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,134
love is more than just an emotion.

138
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:08,909
It is an action.

139
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:11,472
We choose to love,

140
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,830
because we want to choose it.

141
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,376
But we don't need to love.

142
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:18,384
Who here is in love?

143
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,970
Make sure you have
enough money for your dates.

144
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,696
For him, we should not
base love on emotions.

145
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:37,485
Because real love goes beyond mere emotion.

146
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:39,876
When you love,

147
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:42,407
you have something to fight for.

148
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,321
True love requires commitment.

149
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:51,932
Just like God and his commitment
to love us,

150
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,618
despite him dying on the cross.

151
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,163
Okay, this reading will be on the final.

152
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,687
I want you to think about
feeling versus choice

153
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,212
when it comes to love. Okay?

154
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:03,624
See you next week guys.

155
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,462
See you, Bro.

156
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:11,438
D!

157
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,056
What the hell?!

158
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,279
You still scare easy.

159
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:17,923
Some things never change.

160
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,898
Yeah, and you're still childish.

161
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,431
Is that the behavior
of a student body president?

162
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,480
That's part of my charm.

163
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:28,800
That's why I won,
because people think I'm fun.

164
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:31,029
More like annoying.

165
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,058
Geez, I'm kidding.

166
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,658
By the way, I signed up for Journey.

167
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:38,792
So, that means I'll see you
next weekend.

168
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,908
Seriously?

169
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:41,976
Yes.

170
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,452
You're the only one
who doesn't take me seriously.

171
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:45,842
Dominic.

172
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,269
Luke, this is Gio.
Gio, this is Luke.

173
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,808
Of course, I know Luke.

174
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:53,680
MVP of our school.

175
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:56,385
I didn't know you guys were close.

176
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,035
Used to be close.

177
00:11:58,503 --> 00:11:59,660
Past tense.

178
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:02,214
That's why I'm making up for it.

179
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:05,652
Anyway, I have to go
to a student meeting.

180
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:08,824
You're in charge of me in Journey, okay?

181
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:10,746
Can't wait.

182
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:17,511
Have you eaten?

183
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:28,535
So tell me,

184
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,189
why are you and Gio like that?

185
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,378
Like what?

186
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,183
It seems like you guys are really close.

187
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:39,476
Well, we really were close before.

188
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,721
I mean we grew up together.

189
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,644
Like since grade school?

190
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,464
Yeah.

191
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:47,665
Library crew in the 4th grade.

192
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,567
We were neighbors,

193
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:53,753
so he'd come over and
we'd watch cartoons together.

194
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,668
Then high school, we had a falling out.

195
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,488
Because I came out to him.

196
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:02,981
Then I met Timmy. My circle changed.

197
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:05,262
Okay.

198
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,035
But he acts as if nothing
changed between you two.

199
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,538
He's just sucking up to me so that

200
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:14,357
I don't mess up the decorations
for Grad Ball.

201
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,839
Okay.

202
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,019
Why?

203
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,050
What are you thinking?

204
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,800
Don't tell me you're jealous?

205
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,128
Why would I be jealous of him?

206
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,527
I don't know with you.

207
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,417
Don't worry, I'm not.

208
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,199
You sure?

209
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,565
Sure.

210
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:39,729
But...

211
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,449
I'm just thinking about the first sign...

212
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:44,570
Baby R said,

213
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:47,152
"King and Fire."

214
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,441
King and President.

215
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:51,894
Pretty similar, right?

216
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:56,074
So, maybe you should avoid him?

217
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:00,316
Well, I can't because I said yes
to the Grad Ball committee.

218
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,386
So, I have no choice.

219
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,010
- When is your suspension?
- Next week.

220
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:13,911
It sucks.

221
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,902
All because of that ass over there.

222
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,149
Hey.

223
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,618
Why are you here by yourself?

224
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:25,527
Avoiding trouble.

225
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:28,405
Is that what we are now?

226
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,417
Karen dropped by earlier.

227
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,777
She wanted me to give this to you.

228
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,613
How is she?

229
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:55,917
Keeping it together, I guess.

230
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,433
I mean

231
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:59,792
she says she's okay,

232
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:02,285
but... we both know she's not.

233
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:06,297
I know we're not okay

234
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,058
but can you at least
look after her for me?

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,042
Of course,

236
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,730
you're both my friends.

237
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,718
I'm not gonna unfriend her
just because you guys broke up.

238
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:21,323
Thanks, bro.

239
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:22,856
No prob.

240
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:27,756
Luke.

241
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:31,003
Do you really love Dominic?

242
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,188
Yes.

243
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:37,378
Sis.

244
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,947
Sis.

245
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,189
Sis, what happened?

246
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:42,392
I don't know.

247
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,168
He was like this when I got here.

248
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,957
What's happening?

249
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:50,774
Sis, I think Joseph and
I are going to break up.

250
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,861
Huh?

251
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:53,642
How can you break up?

252
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,267
You were never even
together in the first place!

253
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,574
Sorry.

254
00:15:57,784 --> 00:15:59,744
What happened? Tell us, already.

255
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,970
Joseph walked out on me earlier.

256
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,047
- Where?
- The cafeteria.

257
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,667
I think there's someone else.

258
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,093
What? Who?

259
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:12,237
I don't know.

260
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:16,248
I just wanted to talk about
what we were going to wear to Grad Ball.

261
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,860
Then while I was explaining,

262
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,470
he wasn't even listening.

263
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,959
He just kept laughing at a text.

264
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:25,545
I looked at his phone,
he was texting "N."

265
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,537
"N" was the name.

266
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,022
So I confronted him. I said,

267
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,482
are you cheating on me?

268
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,280
What'd Joseph say?

269
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,218
Of course he denied it.

270
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,560
He said I was jealous for no reason.

271
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:38,605
Maybe you are?

272
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,717
You are the queen of assumptions!

273
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:42,678
Why?

274
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,982
But I can feel it, sis.

275
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,134
He's cheating.

276
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,539
Wait, wait,

277
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:50,389
so you mean to tell me,

278
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:55,334
you forced him to admit
to something he didn't do?

279
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,307
So it's my fault now?

280
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,267
So dramatic.

281
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,811
Sis, come here!

282
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,187
Timmy,

283
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,320
you shouldn't get
too emotional right away

284
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:11,272
because maybe he was just
texting a family member.

285
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,500
Family? Really?!

286
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:15,244
With "N" for a name?!

287
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,126
"N" for "Nanay"?!

288
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,455
Seriously, guys!

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,732
I'm just saying,

290
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:25,664
you need to be rational when
it comes to relationships.

291
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,711
Don't let jealousy win.

292
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:29,696
True!

293
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:32,412
Look at me.

294
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:35,263
We are sure that you,

295
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:39,524
you are the only queen
in Joseph's heart.

296
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:40,868
Okay?

297
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,235
Only one.

298
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,079
The only one.

299
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,897
Don't frown. Smile.

300
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,961
Smile.

301
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,482
- Smile!
- Ouch!

302
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:50,383
Sorry.

303
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,517
Here, coffee?

304
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,719
You know, bro.

305
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,172
I'm just gonna say this once.

306
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,586
I miss my friend.

307
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:01,422
Was it worth it?

308
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:04,758
Was a fag worth destroying
ten years of friendship?

309
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:08,633
You know what, Philip.

310
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:10,920
I actually don't miss you.

311
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:15,446
Now I realized, how much
of an asshole you are.

312
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:20,132
Anyways, I'm out of here.

313
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,946
I'm going to let Mr. Oyco
know that I'm done.

314
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:34,180
Hello and welcome Batch 231!

315
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:39,844
Did you know,

316
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,830
that you are the third to the
last batch for this year?

317
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,594
But before you get to your
sleeping quarters,

318
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,093
we'll have a little ice breaker first.

319
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:49,616
- Right, Miguel?
- That's right!

320
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:54,649
Let's start with our special
guest for tonight!

321
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,616
Who'd that be?

322
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:59,692
The ever so handsome, President Gio!

323
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:05,018
Gio! Gio! Gio!

324
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,411
Me? Really?

325
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,899
Yes, you. Because it's rare for us

326
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:11,014
to have a politician in our midst.

327
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,438
- Dork.
- Wow.

328
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:17,593
I'm sure you've heard about
what they say about Journey?

329
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,326
Yes, I'm ready for whatever comes.

330
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:24,942
- Is that right, Gio?
- So, you're ready.

331
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:28,766
Well then, are you ready to get naughty?

332
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:33,018
As long as Dominic gets to punish me.

333
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:34,927
Oh.

334
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:39,099
Oh, a special request for Dominic...

335
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:40,888
- Well, how petite are you?
- Right!

336
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,275
Guys, not in front of Bro. Mike.

337
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,802
And the newbies might get scared.

338
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:48,481
You are safe here in Journey.

339
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:49,204
Okay?

340
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,792
Bro. Mike, we're just kidding.

341
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,653
That's the goal. They should be scared.

342
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,101
And the way he said,

343
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,817
"Not in front of Bro. Mike."

344
00:19:57,842 --> 00:19:59,244
So petite!

345
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,729
Are you ready, Batch 231?

346
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,217
Yes!

347
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,638
When I say Tim, you say, My!

348
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,549
- Tim?
- My!

349
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,660
- Tim?
- My!

350
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:11,483
The goal of F-night
is to let the participants

351
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:12,913
feel that they are safe with us

352
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,903
in order for them to open up to you

353
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:18,155
for the following activities
here in Journey.

354
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,046
They'll have thirty minutes

355
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,272
to talk about love, God and life.

356
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,173
Any questions?

357
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,388
None.

358
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:31,303
Okay, here is the list of
participants and sponsors.

359
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,014
Dominic you're partnered with Pres.

360
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,850
He requested for you.

361
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,874
Do I have a choice?

362
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:38,817
No.

363
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:44,548
Special request?

364
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,846
Seriously?

365
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,717
You're cute when you get like that.

366
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,561
What do you mean,
"when I get like that"?

367
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:56,393
When you get jealous.

368
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:00,553
I'm not jealous.

369
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:03,624
Okay.

370
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:14,967
Wow.

371
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,397
This is a nice setup.

372
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,412
Is this your plan for Grad Ball?

373
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:21,577
Sure.

374
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,606
With the lanterns and grass...

375
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:24,749
Of course not!

376
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,536
I will do you one better, Mr. President.

377
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:29,756
As you should.

378
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,242
But here's the thing.

379
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,491
I can't believe you were able to bring up

380
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:35,171
our library crew days on your speech.

381
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:39,811
Plus, the days where we
would laugh non-stop.

382
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,236
- Those were the days.
- Classic. Oh my god.

383
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,152
Ouch!

384
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,897
Oh shit! Are you okay?

385
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:46,953
I'm sorry!

386
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,592
Are we done yet?
You've barely said anything.

387
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:51,985
Sorry, sorry.

388
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,311
And then, I still remembered that time...

389
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:57,436
when we were both Mulawins.

390
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:00,877
Yes! "Food and now it's stone."

391
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,398
Then we walked out.

392
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:04,640
At least you had a line.

393
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:06,155
All I had were birdcalls.

394
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:08,288
Because I'm a better actor than you.

395
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,668
You're just dramatic.

396
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,883
Luke,

397
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,850
why are you still up?

398
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,905
I was waiting for you.

399
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:18,342
It's already 2AM. You just ended?

400
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,878
Gio couldn't stop crying in the chapel.

401
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:22,190
Liar.

402
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:23,741
I'm kidding.

403
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:26,866
Actually, we ended early. But...

404
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:31,842
This was the only time we
got to talk after a long time.

405
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:36,569
It's because you refused to speak to me.

406
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:37,922
Me?

407
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:39,241
Wait a minute...

408
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:42,453
Nice.

409
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:44,325
You okay, bro?

410
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,897
Oh, yeah. Of course.

411
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,155
Anyways, thank you so much, D.

412
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:57,327
It was fun catching up and
talking about our childhood.

413
00:22:57,957 --> 00:23:00,014
No problem, G!

414
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,229
There we go!

415
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:04,068
Finally called me "G!"

416
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:05,280
Just for now!

417
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:07,108
Just for tonight.

418
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,514
Awesome.

419
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:13,305
Anyway, Luke has waited long enough.

420
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,311
I'll go ahead.

421
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:16,436
See you later, then.

422
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,304
Bye.

423
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,077
What was that all about?

424
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:50,429
I'm not comfortable with you
being all cozy with "G".

425
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:52,945
Why?

426
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:54,746
Because...

427
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,156
Because of Baby R!

428
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,443
He's the first sign!

429
00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,336
No, he's not.

430
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,109
How can you be so sure?

431
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:03,202
Baby R said the...

432
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,585
King and Fire are the first sign.

433
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:09,747
Gio is the president and
you guys were holding candles.

434
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:11,279
So, there!

435
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,631
You are so literal.
That's not how it works.

436
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:14,976
Why not?

437
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:19,575
Luke, you're not making sense!

438
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,335
If you're jealous,
don't use Baby R as an excuse.

439
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,554
I'm not jealous.

440
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,585
The truth?

441
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:31,933
Okay, fine.

442
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,815
It's because he's so touchy with you!

443
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:36,661
And so?

444
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,150
Nothing.

445
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:39,604
It kinda feels weird.

446
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:42,940
Why are you laughing?

447
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:44,596
Can't you see, I'm mad?

448
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:46,846
That's exactly why.

449
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,508
It's funny because there's
nothing to be jealous of.

450
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:51,346
Look at you.

451
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:52,757
You're getting red.

452
00:24:57,544 --> 00:25:00,046
Is that a LeBron jersey?

453
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,594
Yeah, 23 is his number.

454
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,393
Why?

455
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,878
And you're turning red.

456
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,913
Luke,

457
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,314
you're the first sign.

458
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:08,484
What?

459
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,118
You're wearing the number of the King,

460
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,457
you're red from anger,

461
00:25:13,482 --> 00:25:15,408
and red is the color of Fire.

462
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,560
That doesn't make sense.

463
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,627
That's how the signs work.

464
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:25,002
I know it's weird
but it does make sense.

465
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,913
Luke, Baby R said the first sign

466
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,524
is what we should avoid... jealousy,

467
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:33,073
for both you and me.

468
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:36,752
We have to trust each other.

469
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,682
That's why, please

470
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,377
don't be jealous of Gio.

471
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,854
You're cuter than him.

472
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,924
Fine.

473
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,040
Hug me?

474
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:56,322
I've been waiting
for this the whole night.

475
00:25:57,554 --> 00:25:59,916
I wish we could stay like this forever.

476
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,190
I hope so.

477
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,968
(Next Episode)
You don't have to explain anything.

478
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,206
I got everything based on what I saw.

479
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:24,066
I wish he'd tell me.

480
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,319
I mean, I'm his...

481
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:26,876
His what?

482
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,649
He's only been gay a few weeks...
gave up so easy.

483
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:31,111
Luke, answer my question.

484
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,604
Are you gay?
