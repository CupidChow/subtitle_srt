"Love Beneath the Stars"
(Episode 4)

2
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,281
Dominic, be honest with me.

3
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,150
Do you love my son?

4
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:32,453
Ma!

5
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:36,664
Actually,

6
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,039
you don't need to answer that.

7
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,890
I saw all the dramatics outside,

8
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,414
so I know you love my son.

9
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:46,701
Anyway,

10
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,343
I'll leave you two.

11
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:49,952
Don't...

12
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:51,803
you know what I mean...

13
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:52,640
Ma!

14
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,226
- My god.
- Okay, bye.

15
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,664
I'm really sorry, Dominic.

16
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,978
It's a bad habit of mine
to just disappear

17
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:13,054
when I'm just trying to
figure things out for myself.

18
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:17,655
Sorry, too.

19
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,437
Maybe...

20
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:24,476
I'm just scared
that I'm going to lose you.

21
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,538
Don't worry.

22
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,226
That will never happen.

23
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,882
So, what's the problem?

24
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,115
Coach Mark told me
to stay away from you.

25
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,346
He's afraid that being seen with you

26
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,679
might affect my chances
at a college scholarship.

27
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,804
But it's okay.

28
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,671
My mom and I spoke and she said
not to listen to Coach Mark.

29
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,390
You sure?

30
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:53,484
Of course.

31
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:55,889
But that's your future.

32
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,432
If we don't go to Grad Ball together,

33
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,349
I would totally understand.

34
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:02,788
Don't be silly.

35
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:04,453
We're going.

36
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,250
Of course, I want to go
to the Ball with my...

37
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:09,617
boyfriend.

38
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,460
Can you repeat what you just said?

39
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,617
Boyfriend.

40
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:24,762
Spill the T, Pres.

41
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,139
Who is your date to the Grad Ball?

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,670
Yeah, who is the
first lady of St. Francis?

43
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:31,216
Don't tell me it's Madonna.

44
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,570
The super bitch of St. Mary's?!

45
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,492
Don't be silly.

46
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,359
Madonna's a friend.
She's not my date.

47
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:42,254
She asked if we could go
together but I said no.

48
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,125
Because?

49
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:44,492
Busy with prep.

50
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:45,951
No time for a love life.

51
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,535
You have no time for girls?

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,812
Well, what about boys?

53
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:50,625
Maybe.

54
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,833
Pres, I don't have a date yet.

55
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,734
Are you into plus-size?

56
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,382
Let's see.

57
00:03:57,407 --> 00:04:01,132
Omg, sis. There's hope!

58
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,441
Well, look at that!

59
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,850
As if there was no drama yesterday.

60
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,318
Sis, don't be negative.

61
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:08,607
It's too early for that.

62
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,600
Why are you together?

63
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,560
You're part of decorating
committee, too, Luke?

64
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,828
Actually, yes.

65
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,531
I want to spend time
with my boyfriend.

66
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,017
What?!

67
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:18,960
Boyfriend?

68
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,905
Oh my god!

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,078
Spill the T!

70
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,515
Why didn't you tell us right away?

71
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:29,148
So,

72
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:31,179
congrats, bro.

73
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:33,335
Thanks.

74
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:34,799
By the way,

75
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:38,164
I wanted to apologize for
the way I acted in Journey.

76
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:41,787
It was stupid of me to be jealous.

77
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:43,648
Don't worry about it.

78
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,125
I should be the one to apologize.

79
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:48,476
I didn't know you guys had a thing.

80
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,703
But let me warn you as a friend,

81
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,795
don't you dare hurt Dominic.

82
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,515
Don't worry, I won't.

83
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:03,717
Hey! Luke! Get over here
and answer our questions!

84
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:04,546
Oh, no.

85
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,648
Okay, I'll go ahead.

86
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:14,076
Why didn't you tell us about this?

87
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:21,687
I have the results
of the Ateneo entrance exams.

88
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,488
Open them later.

89
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:28,109
If your results are not favorable,

90
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:30,866
you can see me after class
in the faculty office.

91
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:31,991
Okay?

92
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,111
Alright.

93
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:36,361
Agcaoili.

94
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,025
Bernardo.

95
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:42,613
Casumpa.

96
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:47,040
Cruz.

97
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,541
By the way, Dominic.

98
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:54,662
If you carry on doing well in your exams,

99
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,861
the higher your chances
for being valedictorian.

100
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:59,356
Oh, wow!

101
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:01,743
Oh my god, sis!

102
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:07,218
Just make sure that you won't be part

103
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,289
of any disciplinary case
before the year ends.

104
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,478
The board takes that seriously.

105
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,167
Yes, sir.

106
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,217
Congrats, sis!

107
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,505
Speaking of disciplinary cases,

108
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,165
it's Grad Ball this weekend.

109
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,056
Since it'll be held here in school,

110
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,407
do not even think about
bringing in alcohol

111
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,583
or do anything stupid.

112
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:35,181
The faculty will be there, guarding you.

113
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,962
Do you understand?

114
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,173
Yes, sir.

115
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:40,663
Mr. Ramos,

116
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:42,790
Mr. Tejada,

117
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,102
do you understand?

118
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:46,017
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:47,493
Alright.

120
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:48,915
Let's continue.

121
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,968
Dulu.

122
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:52,478
I got into my first course choice in Ateneo.

123
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,065
Management Engineering.

124
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,775
Wow! Congrats!

125
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:57,540
That's a quota course, right?

126
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:58,476
Yes.

127
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,368
I got lucky.

128
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:01,020
That wasn't luck.

129
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,657
You're one of the smartest
people I know, Dominic.

130
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:04,607
Thank you.

131
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,228
I'm sure Mommy would be proud of me now.

132
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,862
I'm sure she's always proud of you.

133
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,939
I hope that's true. But, I don't know.

134
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:14,033
Anyway, what about you guys?

135
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,759
When are your results coming out?

136
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,056
I think after Grad Ball.

137
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,063
We took the test late

138
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:24,470
because it was at the same
time as tournament season.

139
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,062
Wow, special treatment for athletes.

140
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,657
Don't hate the player.

141
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,251
Well, true.

142
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:31,907
By the way,

143
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,181
do you want me
to pick you up on Saturday?

144
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:38,009
I think it's best if we meet at school.

145
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:40,446
Mom doesn't know we're going together.

146
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,295
Okay,

147
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,415
I understand.

148
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,259
But before we leave,

149
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,915
let's take a selfie.

150
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,603
Commemorate this moment.

151
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:53,595
One, two, three.

152
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:56,626
Thank you.

153
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,392
Dominic,

154
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:03,660
is this yours?

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,712
Yes, Mommy.

156
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,008
This is my suit for the Grad Ball.

157
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,342
I can't believe you're all grown up.

158
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,801
Going to your last Ball
before going off to college.

159
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,262
It's a bummer you don't have a date.

160
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,251
I would've wanted
to take a picture of you

161
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:22,685
and your date to put in the family room.

162
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,259
Let him be. Kids these days are like that.

163
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,381
Scared of commitment,
so they stay single.

164
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,773
I don't get why?

165
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,008
Commitment builds character.

166
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:36,181
No wonder kids have no direction in life.

167
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,203
By the way, I got the results from Ateneo.

168
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,298
And?

169
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:43,262
I got in.

170
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:44,587
Management Engineering?

171
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:45,843
Yes, Mommy.

172
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:49,640
Oh my god! My genius son!

173
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,423
Congrats, son! You know
I'm very proud of you, right?

174
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:53,829
Thank you, Daddy.

175
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,126
[Faye] Oh, right!

176
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,562
I now have to call all my friends.

177
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:01,734
Wilma's daughter didn't pass Ateneo.

178
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,178
Showing off again?

179
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:05,296
Well, I'm just a proud mother.

180
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:05,973
Right, Dominic?

181
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:08,681
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh my god! This is good news!

182
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,751
Did anyone ask you to be their date?

183
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:19,725
No one, Dad.

184
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:25,071
Hon, can you call Fred, too.

185
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:30,689
Practice is cancelled
this weekend for Grad Ball.

186
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:36,454
Remember, please always use protection.

187
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,738
Or else before you know it,
you're a teen father.

188
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,845
Hey, I'm being serious here. Okay?

189
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:47,707
Watch yourselves.

190
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,267
I'll be chaperoning this weekend.

191
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,892
You guys better behave.
Am I right, Armada?

192
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,220
Yes, Coach.

193
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,214
Okay, head on home, guys.

194
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,853
- Thank you, Coach!
- Okay.

195
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:09,165
Luke,

196
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,376
wanna walk with us?

197
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:16,032
Come on, for old time's sake. Let's go!

198
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,146
Go grab your bag!

199
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,071
I missed this, guys. Just us three.

200
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:26,900
Walking home
and talking about stupid stuff.

201
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,001
Yeah. Miss it, too.

202
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,656
Especially when we talk about
girls from St. Mary's.

203
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,059
And how they ghosted you?

204
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,544
What the hell!
What do you mean ghosted?

205
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,945
I'm their favorite.

206
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,056
What part?

207
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,025
Asshole!

208
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,474
But now we can't talk about that

209
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:43,642
because that one over there
is not into girls anymore.

210
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:47,759
I can't believe this.

211
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,000
You invited me here to gang up on me?

212
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,687
Bro, we're not ganging up on you.

213
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:53,211
Wait!

214
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,487
Then what the hell do you call this?!

215
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:55,579
Intervention!

216
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:58,142
This is your last chance to change.

217
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,493
What the hell?

218
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,000
Bro, we're willing to forget

219
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,955
what happened between you and that fag.

220
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,349
- Are you serious?
- Hold on. Chill!

221
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,308
We know you plan to take the
homo to Grad Ball as your date.

222
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,793
And? So?

223
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,970
As your brothers,

224
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:18,713
we just want you to realize how
stupid that idea of yours is.

225
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,587
I mean, don't do something so scandalous

226
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:23,064
that it could ruin you, bro.

227
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:24,251
Don't be stupid.

228
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,360
You know what?

229
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:29,687
You're right.

230
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,775
Damn you, both.

231
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:38,547
OMG. I'm proud to say this is fabulous!

232
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,576
Thank you to all of you!
We pulled it off!

233
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,993
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

234
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,634
But you know, Timmy.
Thank you to you and D.

235
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:51,978
Without you guys, I don't know
if we could've pulled it off.

236
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:54,435
But it's also thanks to you, Gio.

237
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,110
If not for you, this wouldn't have
happened in the first place.

238
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,329
So, thank you, Gio.

239
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,165
Thanks, Pres!

240
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:06,267
I'm so touched.

241
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,384
Dork.

242
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:11,015
But seriously, we all deserve
to have fun tomorrow.

243
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,191
So go home and rest.

244
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,851
Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow.

245
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,376
- Yes!
- Bye, guys! Take care.

246
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,321
Let's go guys.

247
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:21,392
Hey.

248
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,509
So you and Luke ready for tomorrow?

249
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,704
I'm the one that still needs to be ready.

250
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:32,519
Wow. Don't tell me...

251
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,486
Perv! Not that!

252
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,165
I'm just worried and excited.

253
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,759
I'm kidding. Why though?

254
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,927
I guess, because it's my
first time being with someone

255
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:49,134
who's not afraid to be with me.

256
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:57,306
Just always remember this, Dominic.

257
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,486
You deserve to be happy. Okay?

258
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,048
Thank you, Gio.

259
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,478
- You, too.
- Thank you.

260
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

261
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Tomorrow's the big day.

262
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,689
Why does it feel like
we're getting married?

263
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,939
I know right? I feel the same.

264
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,911
I don't know. Maybe because
we've been talking about this for so long

265
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,173
and now, we're finally here.

266
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,064
That's true.

267
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,478
I love you, Luke.

268
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,884
I love you, Dominic.

269
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,061
See you later?

270
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,915
Yeah. See you later.

271
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,600
Your suit is nice.

272
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,001
Are you okay?

273
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,343
Sis, take a picture of me and Joseph.

274
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:16,328
We're so cute together.

275
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:16,921
I knew it.

276
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:19,118
I shouldn't have come.
Now, I'm the photographer.

277
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:20,648
Don't worry!

278
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,185
We're setting you up with Pim later.

279
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,046
I heard his date didn't show up.

280
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,361
Let's go then!

281
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,486
Where's Luke?

282
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,025
He said he's nearby.

283
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,234
You guys go ahead and get us a table.

284
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,765
- You sure?
- Reserve a table.

285
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,962
- Will follow.
- Don't be jealous.

286
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,280
Where do you want to take a photo?

287
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:43,728
- There.
- Okay.

288
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:45,897
Where are you?

289
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,094
I'm already here.

290
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,540
Where?

291
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,665
Here... in your heart.

292
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,939
You are so corny.

293
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,337
No, but seriously, I'm here already.

294
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:58,991
Turn around.

295
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,099
Armada. Didn't I tell you...

296
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,443
What the hell are you doing?

297
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:38,943
Coach.

298
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,230
I really do appreciate what you told me

299
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:42,545
and I thank you for that.

300
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:44,646
But I spoke to my mom,

301
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:47,707
and she said to spend this
night with the person I love.

302
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,060
And that's Dominic.

303
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,131
What about your scholarship?

304
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,943
Coach.

305
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,984
You know I'm a good basketball player

306
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,459
and that won't change
just because I'm with Dominic.

307
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,201
You said there's no such thing
as a gay basketball player?

308
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,670
Then let me be the first one.

309
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,506
Anyway, I gotta go.

310
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:15,807
My date's waiting for me.

311
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,118
For our next song,
it's our latest single and

312
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:56,152
this is our first time to perform it.

313
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,709
It's called "Dito."

314
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:01,745
This is for the lovers out there.

315
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:08,388
So if I were you, grab them and
let's feel the love tonight.

316
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:16,709
Dominic, may I have this dance?

317
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,248
Yes, you may.

318
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,224
What are you thinking about?

319
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,060
You.

320
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,697
This night.

321
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,654
This moment.

322
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,115
Sometimes I wonder...

323
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,541
that I don't deserve to have this moment

324
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,037
because I'm born like this.

325
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,670
Though I know we all deserve to be loved.

326
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,021
Sometimes it's like
the world isn't fair...

327
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:06,373
to gay people like me.

328
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,131
But I'm here.

329
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,110
Right now.

330
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,404
With you.

331
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,631
I love you, Dominic.

332
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,318
Always.

333
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,373
I love you, Luke.

334
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:42,349
Always.

335
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:53,521
What would you do if I kiss you now?

336
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:58,459
I would kiss you back.

337
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:25,309
Can someone explain what happened?

338
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:29,068
Father, it's because of that video
going viral on social media.

339
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,342
You? In a scandal?

340
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,123
How? Why?!

341
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:34,079
- Faggot! Faggot!
- Dominic.

342
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:35,341
Why do their parents
allow them to be that way?

343
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,238
Faggot! Faggot!

344
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:38,902
I'm here as the student body council

345
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:41,878
to speak to you regarding
the case of Luke and Dominic.

346
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,623
I love you, too, Luke.

347
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:47,005
But this time,
love isn't going to be enough.
