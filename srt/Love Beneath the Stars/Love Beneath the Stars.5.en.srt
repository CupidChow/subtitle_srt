00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:25,437
"Love Beneath the Stars"
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,582
Can someone explain what happened?

3
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,086
Parents and sponsors have been calling
non-stop since this morning.

4
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,573
I don't understand how this happened.

5
00:01:56,862 --> 00:02:00,793
Father, it's because of that video
going viral on social media.

6
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:04,947
I tried to stop them but I was too late.

7
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:09,045
Mr. Cruz! Mr. Armada! Stop that!

8
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,113
Boys, stop recording!

9
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:12,340
Stop that!

10
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,067
This is a school activity.

11
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,418
How dare you do something so scandalous!

12
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,658
This is a Catholic school event

13
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:19,864
and you're kissing in front of everyone?

14
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,407
Mr. Oyco, calm down.

15
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,088
How can I calm down, Brother Mike?

16
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:24,327
Didn't you see what they were doing

17
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,550
in the middle of the dance floor?

18
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,769
This is a disgrace to our institution.

19
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,049
The students are going live!

20
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:32,261
I said stop that!

21
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:33,869
This is unacceptable.

22
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:35,505
There's nothing wrong
with what they did.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,549
Do I really need to answer you,
Bro. Mike?

24
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,927
Mr. Oyco, now is not the time
to get hysterical.

25
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,550
The students are watching us.

26
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,039
Dominic and Luke, step away first.

27
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,208
Coach, please take Luke.

28
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,626
Dominic, come with me first.

29
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,063
Mr. Oyco, I suggest you
calm down the students.

30
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,570
They're making a show out of this.

31
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,539
This isn't over.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,789
We couldn't do anything
once it was posted on social media.

33
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,929
It went viral.

34
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,767
It had several shares.

35
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,837
There are so many negative and
angry comments about our school.

36
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,801
Everyone is wondering...

37
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:18,106
why we allow such behavior
in an all-boys Catholic school.

38
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,175
Those two boys must be expelled.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,959
Mr. Oyco, did you read all the comments?

40
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,028
Or just the ones you wanted to read?

41
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,731
Because there was a lot of
unexpected praise, too.

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,281
Many commend us on being progressive.

43
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:35,035
And how we, as a Catholic school,

44
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,410
accepts all kinds of love.

45
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:39,809
Shouldn't we be focusing
on those types of comments?

46
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,885
And if you were to punish them,

47
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,167
what were they in violation
of in the school handbook?

48
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,963
Unbecoming of a gentleman.
Code of conduct.

49
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:51,081
They should represent
what is right and just.

50
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,683
So it's unbecoming of a gentleman to love?

51
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,268
That's not my point, Bro. Mike.

52
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,604
Do not twist the interpretation
of the handbook.

53
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,964
Mr. Oyco, it's 2020.

54
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,840
Let's go with the times.

55
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,552
Even Pope Francis changed
his stand towards homosexuality.

56
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,287
- You should, too.
- You dragged the Pope into this?

57
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,824
Enough! Enough! Enough!

58
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:09,839
Stop arguing!

59
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:15,301
We should be focusing on a
solution to the problem at hand.

60
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:22,910
You, Coach Mark, what do you
have to say about this?

61
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,407
Well, Father Giboy...

62
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:28,442
You're going viral on social media.

63
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,128
Luke, there's no going back.

64
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,449
The colleges will soon find out.

65
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:36,530
This is the reality you chose.

66
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:41,028
Coach, honestly,
I really don't care about that.

67
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,392
Because all I can think about
right now is, Dominic.

68
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,653
Now is not the time for that, Luke.

69
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,738
And you need to call your mother.

70
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,426
I'm not sure if this matters to you,

71
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,582
but Luke really loves Dominic.

72
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:01,101
And I'm not sure if they
should be punished for it.

73
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,379
But that wasn't the venue for that.

74
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,799
It was a school event!

75
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:05,988
Mr. Oyco, I know that.

76
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:07,886
And I'm not defending their actions

77
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:10,410
because it is affecting our school.

78
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,473
Okay, thank you.

79
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:16,667
Now, what do you recommend we do?

80
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:17,651
Expulsion.

81
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:18,362
Warning.

82
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:19,513
Suspension.

83
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:23,012
Thank you.

84
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,116
Okay.

85
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:31,309
I will think about how to go about this.

86
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,113
For now, Mr. Oyco, call them
in with their parents.

87
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,334
Set a meeting with them
as soon as possible.

88
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:44,832
The school should also
release a public statement.

89
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:59,100
Dominic, this is totally unacceptable!

90
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:03,466
We didn't raise you for you
to do this to us.

91
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,495
Do you know how many people
are messaging me

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,758
asking if it is my son on that video?!

93
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:13,449
Oh my god, of all people, Dominic.

94
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,957
You? In a scandal?

95
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:20,892
How? Why?!

96
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,648
I don't understand!

97
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,220
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- Sorry?

98
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,941
What will "sorry" do?

99
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,823
Will it remove the stain on your name?

100
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:36,231
My name? Our family's name?!

101
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:39,916
I don't know what to do.

102
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:43,440
And you being Valedictorian?

103
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:45,728
It's all gone.

104
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:46,920
Gone!

105
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,118
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,137
Hon...

107
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,421
It's not like he wanted this to happen.

108
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:00,629
Let him be.

109
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,918
He said sorry. What more do you want?

110
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,996
Dominic.

111
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:13,705
Look at me.

112
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,645
Look at me!

113
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,293
We don't deserve this.

114
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,262
I'm sorry, Dad.

115
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:04,348
It's okay...

116
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,551
It's okay.

117
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:21,976
Here, listen to this comment
on the video.

118
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:26,787
"Those two guys are so cute."

119
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:27,730
Ma.

120
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:29,859
Why?

121
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,556
I'm just trying to make you laugh.

122
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:36,449
I don't see anything wrong with this video.

123
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,321
People are over-reacting,
so small-minded.

124
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,387
Not everyone is like you, Ma.

125
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,315
Well, there should be more like me.

126
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,782
It wouldn't hurt to at least be kind.

127
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,547
They're so frustrating.

128
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,801
So, has Dominic replied?

129
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:00,699
Not yet.

130
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,168
Well, if his parents are like
what you've mentioned,

131
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,746
I guess, leave him alone first.

132
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:26,871
Just don't give up on him.

133
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:29,995
You must be strong for you both.

134
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:34,606
Thanks, Ma.

135
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,350
You're welcome.

136
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,418
I have to go.

137
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:51,658
Bro, look. It's the fag.

138
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,768
Bro, isn't that the guy from the video?

139
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,378
Yeah, gross.

140
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:57,405
Why do their parents
allow them to be that way?

141
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,215
Faggot! Faggot!

142
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,106
You guys are such assholes!

143
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:03,856
Try and do that again.

144
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,064
Yuck.

145
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,723
Idiots.

146
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:27,558
May I sit?

147
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:31,351
Why are you here?

148
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,387
I saw you run in here.

149
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:38,216
Just wanted to see if you're okay.

150
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,682
Well, I'm not.

151
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:45,930
Thought so...

152
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:48,622
This was your favorite spot

153
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,051
when we'd play hide-and-seek
when we were little.

154
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,270
Old habits.

155
00:10:58,714 --> 00:10:59,923
Honestly,

156
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:03,509
I don't know why I'm so affected.

157
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,005
This is not the first time

158
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,199
someone called me gay in public.

159
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:16,645
I remember when Timmy and I
would fight back

160
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,611
the people who taunted us.

161
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:25,457
Up to the point where
we just didn't care anymore.

162
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:33,067
Now, I don't know why
I'm hiding from them.

163
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,468
Maybe, you're just tired.

164
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,909
Maybe...

165
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:45,869
Or...

166
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:54,723
maybe because now I'm scared
because my parents are involved.

167
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,092
You know how much I wanted
to make them proud.

168
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,636
That's been my goal ever since.

169
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:07,861
How is Auntie Faye?

170
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,182
Worse than the time she caught us

171
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:15,473
playing video games on a weekday.

172
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,947
Shit. Monster Mom is back.

173
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,441
I know, right.

174
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,559
D, just always remember...

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,961
Many of us are ready to defend you.

176
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:36,496
You are not alone.

177
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,473
Okay?

178
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,176
Thanks.

179
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,996
Thank God we're friends again.

180
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,238
Same.

181
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:52,079
Hey.

182
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
Ow!

183
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:56,098
That's your fault.

184
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,840
Give me a smile.

185
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,888
This Friday,

186
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,749
Fr. Giboy is scheduled to meet
with Dominic and Luke.

187
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,932
They'll release an official
statement after the discussion.

188
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:18,192
That's why I think we, as the
student body of this school

189
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,024
should also release a statement about it.

190
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,008
What for?

191
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,535
Why are we meddling?

192
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,904
You know Pim, you're something else.

193
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,838
We all know how biased

194
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:30,284
the "prefect of discipline"
Mr. Oyco is to people like us.

195
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,771
Just hold a pink fan and we get punished.

196
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,081
What more now with the viral video?

197
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,004
If he had his way,
they'd both be expelled.

198
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:41,940
- They don't deserve that.
- I get your point,

199
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,689
but what they did is still wrong.

200
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:44,381
How?

201
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,503
It affected the whole school,

202
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,385
and us being the
student body of this school

203
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,174
should represent what is right

204
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,971
for the majority of the students.

205
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,474
Not just the LGBTQ+.

206
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,837
You're really an ass!
So we're not part of that?

207
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,280
Guys! Stop.

208
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,057
That's enough.

209
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,067
We should stop arguing.

210
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,320
I understand they are partly at fault.

211
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,015
And the school has the right
to give a sanction.

212
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,297
Personally, I don't think
they're in the wrong.

213
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,129
It's their right, their feelings.

214
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:17,088
But the school got the backlash.

215
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,083
But they didn't upload the video.

216
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,226
I know, Timmy.

217
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:23,699
That's why we need to ask
for a fair trial.

218
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,309
They are the victims of this.

219
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:29,758
That's why I believe we need
to make a stand about this.

220
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,394
A fair stand that will tell the school

221
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:35,215
that we are here to protect
the interest of everyone

222
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:40,254
including the LGBTQ+ community.

223
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:42,685
Understood?

224
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:43,848
Yes, Pres.

225
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,129
Yes, Pres.

226
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,173
- Philip!
- Here.

227
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,409
- Philip!
- Pass it here!

228
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:54,610
- Philip!
- Here!

229
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:56,832
- Pass it!
- Are you kidding me?

230
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,824
Come over here, guys!

231
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,606
What's your problem?

232
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,020
Why aren't you passing the ball to Luke?

233
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,046
He's wide open.

234
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:13,590
Coach, we're not comfortable
having a homo in the court.

235
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:14,741
Damn.

236
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,224
Do you hear yourself?!

237
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,793
- But, Coach...
- No buts, Philip!

238
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,464
How many years have you
been teammates with Luke?

239
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,371
And now you're disgusted?

240
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:29,926
I don't care if he's gay or not.

241
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,536
He is still the best player in the team.

242
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,379
Guys... Please.

243
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,832
Do better.

244
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:46,375
Don't add more problems to your teammate.

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,652
It's okay, Coach.

246
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:50,263
If they don't want to pass that's fine.

247
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,800
I'll just do my best if they
decide to pass the ball.

248
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:57,778
Don't worry.

249
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,356
If I get the ball,
I'll pass it straight to you.

250
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,077
Thanks.

251
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,566
Good afternoon, Fr. Giboy, Mr. Oyco.

252
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,634
Good afternoon.

253
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,543
Come in.

254
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:19,699
Gio, why are you here?

255
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:23,691
I'm here as the student body council

256
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,903
to speak to you regarding
the case of Luke and Dominic.

257
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,741
And what is it that the
students have to say?

258
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:35,237
We just want a fair punishment for them.

259
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:38,081
And what is fair to you?

260
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,376
Suspension.

261
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:46,457
They will never learn with
a punishment that light.

262
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,988
It'll just keep happening.

263
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,692
But Mr. Oyco, Fr. Giboy,

264
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,279
there's nothing in the student
handbook that says

265
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,575
there should be punishment
for two boys kissing.

266
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,562
That's why we are here as
the prefect of discipline.

267
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:05,788
To give interpretation to
the rules of the handbook.

268
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:07,832
But they didn't do anything wrong.

269
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,848
I don't know why you can't see that.

270
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:15,598
You teach us to be like Christ, right?

271
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,331
To accept and love everyone.

272
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,764
How is this any different?

273
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:26,937
Mr. Dela Cruz, you are in no
position to tell us what to do.

274
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:30,132
Actually Sir, I am, as the
president of the student council.

275
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:31,657
And that is our stand.

276
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,514
If the decision isn't fair,

277
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,986
we are prepared to release
a statement against the school.

278
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,008
- Are you threatening us?
- That's enough.

279
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:46,750
Gio, calm down.

280
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:52,102
I have not decided on anything
about the two boys.

281
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,633
You are right and so is Mr. Oyco.

282
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,453
It is not that simple

283
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,836
because there are several
factors to consider.

284
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:04,825
Okay?

285
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:08,922
So please stop adding to the problem.

286
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,024
(I know you need space, Dominic.)

287
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,608
(Whatever happens tomorrow,
know that we'll survive.)

288
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,665
(We can do this together, I love you.)

289
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,438
Ben,

290
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,794
don't go to work tomorrow.

291
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:57,945
We need you there

292
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,204
when we meet up with
the parents of that kid.

293
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,579
Hon, do me a favor.

294
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:06,673
Promise me you won't
make a scene tomorrow.

295
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,173
Of course, I won't.

296
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:13,375
But it doesn't mean that
I won't speak my mind.

297
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:18,297
I still can't believe I'm being called
to the Headmaster's office.

298
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,516
Never in my wildest dreams.

299
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:23,305
Let's just eat.

300
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:26,836
Rice?

301
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,493
No, not today.

302
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:29,907
Wow, no rice.

303
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,263
Dominic, chicken?

304
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,461
I'm okay.

305
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:47,990
I'm sure you all know why
I called you in here today.

306
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,219
The video of you two went viral.

307
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:58,132
Though I don't see anything
wrong with two people in love.

308
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:59,368
But what was wrong was...

309
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,149
the time and place where it happened.

310
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,974
Due to this, the school was affected.

311
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,210
And because it's all over social media,

312
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,539
we must release a statement.

313
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:18,000
I asked the prefect of discipline

314
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:21,688
what they think is a just
punishment for you.

315
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,253
One said that you should be expelled.

316
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:29,227
I believe that it is too extreme.

317
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,747
Because your only fault

318
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,336
was letting your emotions
run away with you.

319
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:46,584
So what is your decision?

320
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,297
You should thank the student council.

321
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,137
Gio came to us yesterday

322
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:54,998
to let us know where
the student body stands.

323
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:59,232
I don't want to add any more
problems to the school,

324
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:02,860
but they are right,

325
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:06,911
you didn't violate anything
in the handbook.

326
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:14,445
It doesn't say to punish
two people kissing.

327
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,063
Because if there was,

328
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:20,749
then I would have to punish
every boy and girl

329
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,164
kissing during the Grad Ball.

330
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,475
But your case is different

331
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:29,733
because it went viral
and affected the school.

332
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,608
And if I make the wrong decision,

333
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:39,344
then the school will suffer more.

334
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:45,352
So I made a decision that I think is fair.

335
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,172
You will be suspended.

336
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,205
Thank you, Father.

337
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:56,789
But on one condition.

338
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:01,196
You must break up.

339
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:08,304
What does that have to do with this?

340
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,450
Everything.

341
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,204
Of course, they'll break up.

342
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:14,444
They shouldn't have been
together in the first place.

343
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:16,671
It is not our decision.

344
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:17,829
And why not?

345
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,296
We are the parents
and we know better.

346
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:24,414
You know, that's why
your son is afraid of you.

347
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:26,234
Because that's how you think.

348
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,874
And that's why your son is messed up,

349
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:31,717
because that's how you think.

350
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,899
Hon, Mrs. Armada.

351
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,922
This is not the place to argue.

352
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,725
Sorry, Father Giboy.

353
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:40,581
Are you both done?

354
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:42,336
Sorry, Father.

355
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,379
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,164
There is only one reason why
I want you to break up.

357
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,119
I don't want to add more
problems to the school.

358
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,282
I am not against your relationship.

359
00:22:55,493 --> 00:23:03,368
But remember that St. Francis
is an institution of learning.

360
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:10,100
I am here to honor what you choose,

361
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,032
not what your parents choose.

362
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:15,011
But Father, we are the parents.

363
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,118
I think we should have a say
in this matter.

364
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:20,687
Let them talk it out. We owe it to them.

365
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,959
- I disagree.
- Honey,

366
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,469
let's just step outside. Okay?

367
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:29,733
Let's leave them to it.

368
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,344
Let's head over to the other room.

369
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,055
Let's give them time.

370
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,955
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:25,899
Everything is my fault.

372
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:27,400
Please stop.

373
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:29,461
Don't say that.

374
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:35,256
Don't say sorry for loving me.

375
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:38,875
No.

376
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,507
That's not what I meant.

377
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:42,997
I will never say sorry for that.

378
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:46,258
I love you, Dominic. Always.

379
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:51,454
I love you too, Luke.

380
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,498
But this time,
love isn't going to be enough.

381
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,149
Our future is on the line.

382
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:10,252
What good is love if we can't graduate.

383
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,196
I'm sure we can still talk to Fr. Giboy.

384
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,781
We can make another compromise.

385
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,183
That was it, Luke.

386
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:24,552
We have to think about what's best

387
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:26,250
not only for ourselves,

388
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,594
but also for our families.

389
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:42,954
I'm sorry, Luke.

390
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,618
I'm not as brave as you.

391
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,991
(Next Episode)
I have a favor to ask.

392
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,514
I really want to talk to him.

393
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,873
I think I know someone who can help you.

394
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,342
Why are you doing this?

395
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,899
Because I want you to be happy, Dominic.

396
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:22,176
If you don't love me,

397
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:25,163
please tell me
that you don't love me anymore

398
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:27,954
so I can let you go.

399
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,020
I'm not as brave as you, Luke.
