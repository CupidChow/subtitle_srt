1
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,374
Good evening.

2
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,990
To those who just arrived, I am Timmy.

3
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:49,419
The most beautiful creature
in this school.

4
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:53,388
And next to me is, Miguel.
The most...

5
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,474
You guys decide!

6
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:58,366
Oh, really?

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,677
Anyway,

8
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,895
welcome to "Songs for Maria!"

9
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,129
- (See you tomorrow, 7pm. I won't be late.)
- (See you tomorrow.)

10
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,778
A concert for our beloved...

11
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:06,722
(Where are you na?)

12
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:09,231
Sis! You ready? It's almost 7pm!

13
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:10,093
We have to start on time

14
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:11,495
because Pim has to be
somewhere right after.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,256
Can we wait? It's still early...

16
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,706
Sis. Ready or not, it's on.

17
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,286
Doesn't he have basketball practice?

18
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,559
No. Last night he promised he'd show up.

19
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:22,807
Promises! Promises! You flirts!

20
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,585
Two minutes but if he's
not here, then he's not here.

21
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,312
He's not worth it.

22
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,838
The shade...

23
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:29,981
Two minutes!

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,716
What are we waiting for?

25
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,510
Nothing, Brother Mike.

26
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,106
We're actually about to start, right?

27
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,442
Yes, yes! Right now.

28
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,056
And now, to start our program,

29
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:41,669
we'd like to call on our
resident singer-ist,

30
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:45,538
Dominic, to lead us in a song.

Dominic! Dominic!

50
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:05,241
"Love Beneath the Stars"
(Episode 1)

51
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:15,944
I really thought
you weren't gonna make it.

52
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,796
Actually, me too.

53
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,022
Mr. Oyco's class took forever...

54
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:25,147
but I told you last night I'd be here.

55
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,210
So... here I am.

56
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:30,054
Well, I appreciate the effort.

57
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,749
Thank you.

58
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,577
Don't I get a reward?

59
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:36,476
Dork.

60
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,723
Hey, I think you need to go.

61
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:43,335
You'll be late to basketball practice.

62
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,746
Can't I stay a little longer?

63
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,184
Luke.

64
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,293
You're an athletic scholar.

65
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,290
You need to attend practice.

66
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,082
Even though I know you don't
want to see Philip and the guys.

67
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,723
Coach Mark will get upset.

68
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,426
Besides we'll see each other
this weekend.

69
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,660
Remember we scheduled with Baby R?

70
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,301
Do we really have to go?

71
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,459
Yes.

72
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:08,949
Okay, fine.

73
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,200
See you later, Dominic.

74
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:12,816
See you later, Luke.

75
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,387
So are you guys together?

76
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,680
I think?

77
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,262
Why does it seem like you're unsure?

78
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,024
I don't know. We haven't
really talked about it.

79
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,809
What about Grad Ball?
Is he your date?

80
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,715
I guess? I mean, most likely.

81
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,165
I don't know.

82
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,331
Talk to him! It's hard
to not know where you're at.

83
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:47,401
It's better to know what you are,

84
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,823
like me and Joseph!

85
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,315
You are so not together!

86
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,520
I know, but at least
we have a mutual understanding!

87
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:56,570
Don't be jealous, people die of that.

88
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,763
Your finger stinks!

89
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:58,979
You're just jealous.

90
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,877
You don't have a Joseph.

91
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,618
Whatever.

92
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,369
Fine, he's yours then.

93
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,666
You bet your ass he's mine.

94
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:07,734
What now, Armada?

95
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,377
Just because the tournament's over,

96
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:11,917
you're going to be late to training?

97
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,557
Coach, he's lost.

98
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,424
We don't even know if our
friend is straight or not.

99
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,252
Damn you!

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,127
Hey! That's enough.

101
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:28,009
I don't care what you do
outside of training.

102
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:31,171
Just don't ruin your future.

103
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,924
Remember, college teams haven't
finalized their recruitment.

104
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:40,333
I'm still lobbying you guys
to the top schools.

105
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:44,917
So if you want to get into
a team, do better.

106
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,215
Sorry, Coach.

107
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:48,979
It won't happen again.

108
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,889
I've reviewed the report of Mr. Oyco.

109
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,917
And what happened on Marian
Grounds is unacceptable.

110
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,893
For whatever reason,
violence is not tolerated.

111
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:12,549
You're parents sent you to a private
Catholic school to be decent gentlemen.

112
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,815
Not goons.

113
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:16,338
Because Christ was like that.

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,127
And you should be, too.

115
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,995
But what's done is done.
And now, here we are.

116
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:31,147
According to Mr. Oyco,
you'll be suspended for one day.

117
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:36,127
Mr. Oyco, give them the suspension letter.

118
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,487
You need to have your parents sign that.

119
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:44,480
You have until next week
to return those to me.

120
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,440
And don't even think about

121
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,467
forging your parent's signatures.

122
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,092
It won't end well for you.

123
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:04,901
D!

124
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:07,917
Gio?

125
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,440
Who else would it be?

126
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:14,167
D, wait!

127
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,118
Stop talking, we're in the library.

128
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,559
Just wait.

129
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,919
What is it that you want?

130
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:22,073
Why are you mad? Can't we just talk?

131
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,167
I don't know with you.

132
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:24,549
You were the one who left, remember?

133
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:26,885
Past is past.

134
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,177
You talk as if something happened
between us.

135
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,932
Hey. I'm kidding, D!

136
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,635
[Dominic]
What is it that you want?

137
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,290
I want to ask you to head the
decorations committee of our Grad Ball.

138
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,815
And be with you every day? Forget it.

139
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,713
Are you that grossed out by me, D?

140
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:50,682
Seriously.

141
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,865
I'm asking not as your childhood friend

142
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,862
but as your student body president.

143
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:58,120
I really need your skills
for the Grad Ball.

144
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:01,299
We all know you're the best
with decorations.

145
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,401
It's an extracurricular

146
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,213
and plus points
for your college applications!

147
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,518
I'm sure Aunt Faye would approve.

148
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:11,393
I'll think about it.

149
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,252
That's not a no.

150
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,362
Meeting is next week.

151
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,323
I'll text the details.

152
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:19,518
I didn't say yes.

153
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,198
What? You were suspended before?

154
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:29,096
Yeah, for cheating on my homework.

155
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,127
Seriously?

156
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:32,862
Yeah.

157
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,868
Mr. Tomas was being an ass.

158
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,226
We were behind so we copied off
someone's homework.

159
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,587
Me, Philip and Andoy.

160
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:45,120
The usual.

161
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,424
You guys are really close, huh?

162
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:50,987
Yeah,

163
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,909
like brothers.

164
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,471
Sorry.

165
00:09:58,895 --> 00:09:59,979
Sorry for what?

166
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,864
You fought because of me.

167
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:07,932
You don't have to say sorry.

168
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,729
It's not your fault,
they're so close-minded.

169
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,104
I guess...

170
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:17,596
Still, I hope things work out in the end.

171
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:20,737
Maybe after Grad Ball.

172
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,823
Speaking of Grad Ball.

173
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:27,651
What's the plan?

174
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,157
Are we going together?

175
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:32,237
Of course!

176
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,635
Why would you think otherwise?

177
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:36,846
I don't know.

178
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,432
We never talked about it after...

179
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,932
you know... the field.

180
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,635
And you haven't done a promposal.

181
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,166
I need a promposal?

182
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:51,446
Of course!

183
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,173
You might think I'm an easy girl.

184
00:10:56,663 --> 00:11:00,479
I mean, I made such an effort
for Karen's promposal.

185
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:05,429
Yeah. It's kind of weird now.

186
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,729
Have you spoken to her?

187
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,197
Not yet.

188
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,643
But I will. I promise.

189
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:46,417
Heads...

190
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:48,682
I'll talk to her.

191
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,549
Tails...

192
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,191
Maybe another time.

193
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,896
I think this is the right place.
It matches the message.

194
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:08,549
Are you sure it's the right place?

195
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,081
I think so...

196
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,440
Wait, you still haven't answered
my question.

197
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,479
What are we doing in a resort?

198
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:16,730
I don't know.

199
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,893
All she said was to come to this address.

200
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,408
Where is she?

201
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,471
Welcome! Welcome!

202
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:37,712
What are we doing in this place?

203
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,487
This is where I live now.

204
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:42,486
I'm the in-house fortune-teller

205
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,151
of the Good Fortune
Mountain Beach resort.

206
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:49,534
Good pay with free housing
and a pool! Bam!

207
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,768
Anyway, is he the guy from the cards?

208
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,674
Yes! Destiny favors you!

209
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,221
So, why are you here?

210
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:08,065
To show off...

211
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,713
What's your name?

212
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,375
Sorry. It's Luke.

213
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,924
Love it! Luke.

214
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:18,620
Like "Stop. Luke. Listen."

215
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,121
So, what can I help you with?

216
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:27,527
Guidance. Since, you know
the cards brought us together.

217
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,643
We just want to know how the cards
will help us stay together?

218
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:33,463
Is that so?

219
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:37,072
Perfect, I have a couple's promo!

220
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,909
Jopay, bring out the rope!

221
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,799
What's this?

222
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:50,667
My ritual. You ready?

223
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:01,377
Love.

224
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,612
Destiny. Love.

225
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,620
Help us.

226
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:16,377
Please sit.

227
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,876
Let me repeat myself, because
later on if you break up,

228
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,252
you might come for me.

229
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,222
The cards are merely for guidance.

230
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:35,682
They may change depending
on the decisions you make.

231
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,417
Do you understand?

232
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,471
Yes.

233
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,973
I will provide you with 3 signs.

234
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,960
These will help strengthen
your relationship.

235
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,510
Do you see this?

236
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:52,528
This is the card of the King and Fire.

237
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,917
You must be cautious.

238
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:02,174
Because this first sign
is a warning to you both.

239
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:10,092
There is a man, the King,
that you must avoid.

240
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,636
Because, like fire, get too close,

241
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,057
you may get burned.

242
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:17,088
A man that will come between us?

243
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,299
A third party?

244
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:23,332
Well, look at you?
Assuming a third party already.

245
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,174
May not be a third party.

246
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,979
This could also symbolize
a trait of a person.

247
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:36,791
It could be you
or Mr. Handsome over here.

248
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,877
Will the cards tell us
when it will happen?

249
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:44,909
It doesn't say. But it is inevitable.

250
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,237
Here is the second sign.

251
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,995
This is the card of the Sun.

252
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:56,785
It symbolizes knowledge
or something to be proud of.

253
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,362
Something you will not be ashamed of.

254
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:03,273
Beside it is the card of the Lovers.

255
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,127
This may mean that you
will be faced with a situation

256
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:08,917
where you will be proud of each other.

257
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:09,693
When will that...

258
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,307
The cards do not say when this will be.

259
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,432
Just treasure what you have right now.

260
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,971
Oh my gosh, exciting.

261
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:21,635
Maybe...

262
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:24,557
You'll tell your parents about me?

263
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,769
Then you'll invite me over for dinner.

264
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:28,415
LOL. Never gonna happen.

265
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,238
Why?

266
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,526
My mom would kill me.

267
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:31,782
No, I'm sure she'd love me.

268
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:32,877
No. I swear.

269
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,654
"No. I swear."

270
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,622
Stop being so dramatic.
We're not done yet.

271
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,127
Sorry.

272
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,206
Kids these days...

273
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,760
Here is the third sign.

274
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:53,963
This is the most important sign
for you both.

275
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,331
See this card?

276
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,104
This is "The Fool" card.

277
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,620
There is a man standing on a cliff

278
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:05,315
this means you both
have a decision to make.

279
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:10,823
Will you jump into the ravine
or stay where you are.

280
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,526
Next to this is the World card.

281
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,377
This means an important decision
will change both your worlds.

282
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,854
It doesn't say if...

283
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,772
it'll be a positive or negative impact.

284
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:30,267
Just remember, think long and
hard about your final choice.

285
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,151
Sounds so serious.

286
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:36,924
Yes. Destiny is no joke.

287
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,243
Actually, I have more questions now.

288
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,612
The promo is over!

289
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,815
I've already given you so much!

290
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,237
(mommy calling...)

291
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,956
Wait, I have to take this. Excuse me.

292
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,026
Fine. What is your question?

293
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:04,042
Well...

294
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:06,108
I'm looking for a sign.

295
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,284
If I should talk to her already.

296
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,377
Pull two more cards.

297
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,362
These are the Death and Star cards.

298
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,254
Two very different things
but deeply connected.

299
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:33,659
When you have closure, only then
can you change and grow.

300
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,006
Whatever it is you're waiting for,

301
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,249
don't wait any longer.

302
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,901
There will never be a "right time."

303
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:42,761
You just need to do it now.

304
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,862
Did I miss anything?

305
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:52,793
Nothing.

306
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:53,607
You did.

307
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:54,643
Payment.

308
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,221
Hi.

309
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:10,345
Hi.

310
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,581
We should really stop meeting like this.

311
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,479
One where you know
someone is going to cry.

312
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah.

313
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,073
I know.

314
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,312
I'm sorry, Karen.

315
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:02,346
You're in love with someone else.

316
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,420
Who is she?

317
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,227
It's Dominic.

318
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,167
Are you serious?

319
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,190
How?

320
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:42,354
I don't know how it happened.

321
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,338
But it did.

322
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,698
I'm in love with Dominic.

323
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,949
I really am sorry, Karen.

324
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:56,016
No.

325
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,423
I still love you, Luke.

326
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:01,182
Gio, question.

327
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,682
Did you review the list of
people going to the Grad Ball?

328
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:06,198
Yes, Pim. What about it?

329
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,226
Timmy and Joseph are going together.

330
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:10,045
Is that acceptable?

331
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,721
Hey Pim, what are you trying to say?

332
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,193
Nothing, I'm just making sure
if it's allowed.

333
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:17,220
And why wouldn't it be?

334
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,329
We're both stag.

335
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:21,165
Yeah, but you're still both guys.

336
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,727
OMG. Homophobe.

337
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,129
I can't believe there's
a homophobe in this committee.

338
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,018
I'm not a homophobe, I just
want to clarify the issue.

339
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,635
Guys, relax. Timmy, calm down.

340
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:31,956
I have seen the list.

341
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,627
There's nothing wrong with
Timmy and Joseph going together.

342
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:38,190
Besides, there are no rules about that

343
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,642
in the student handbook.

344
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,939
Also, we welcome everyone,

345
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,538
including our friends
from the LGBTQ+ community.

346
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,651
Yes! Gio for best student president ever!

347
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:52,739
And Pim, don't worry about their dates.

348
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:54,890
Just worry about yours.

349
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,599
Oh, so you still don't have a date.

350
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,471
I'll hook you up with someone.

351
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:00,870
You, D? Do you have a date?

352
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:05,698
Oh wow, code names. Okay, "D."

353
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,179
Cut it out, sis.

354
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:09,120
Just answer the question.

355
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:11,144
Do you have a date?

356
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,573
Change topic.

357
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:15,847
My date is not the point of this meeting.

358
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,182
Well, that's true.

359
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,149
Anyways, that's all for today's meeting.

360
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:24,624
If you have any questions, just ask.

361
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:25,907
I'll be around.

362
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:27,837
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks, Pres.

363
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:28,854
Thanks Gio.

364
00:23:30,797 --> 00:23:32,065
D, hold on.

365
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:37,057
What now, Gio?

366
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,377
Nothing. Just...

367
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,935
wanted to thank you

368
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,401
for being the head
of the decorations committee.

369
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:51,784
Well, you said it would look
good on my college application.

370
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,603
Oh, I thought you did it for me.

371
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:56,851
C'mon. Stop it.

372
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:58,362
We're not kids anymore.

373
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:02,940
Anyways, I was thinking of signing up
for Journey's next batch.

374
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:04,729
Are you still active there?

375
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,753
I thought you were an atheist?

376
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:08,588
Well, I just want to see the hype.

377
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,409
Hype?

378
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:12,104
It's a religious retreat, not a concert.

379
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,596
I've been thinking about it.

380
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,143
You'll be with me right?

381
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:17,206
No.

382
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:18,893
Come on, D.

383
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,745
Can you stop calling me "D."

384
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,411
What the?

385
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,181
What's this?

386
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,448
Well.

387
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,776
You said
you weren't an easy girl.

388
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,245
So...

389
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:42,235

Dominic.

418
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:07,276
Destiny brought us together.

419
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:11,525
And I know it wasn't easy but...

420
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:14,932
It was all worth it.

421
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,666
And I know I may get lost sometimes, but

422
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,260
I just want you to know
that I will always,

423
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,220
always come back to you.

424
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,771
I love you, Dominic.

425
00:27:38,747 --> 00:27:40,956
And I love you, too, Luke.

426
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,143
You know I don't like to assume, so...

427
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:54,651
Dominic.

428
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,509
Will you go to the Grad Ball with me?

429
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,362
Of course not.

430
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,393
Kidding! Of course!

431
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,502
So there, I said yes!

432
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:17,540
OMG! Sis! What is this,
an engagement?! "I said, yes!"

433
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,829
But in fairness, kudos to the guitar!

434
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:21,925
Plus points!

435
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,299
And we even sang together.

436
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:28,307
Our Queen Petite!

437
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:30,596
Hi Dominic.

438
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:45,893
(Next Episode)
I want you to know that I love Luke.

439
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:47,471
And I'm willing
to fight for him.

440
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,042
You're the only one who
doesn't take me seriously.

441
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,065
I didn't know you guys were close.

442
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,898
You're cute when you get like that.

443
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,768
What do you mean,
"when I get like that"?

444
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:58,854
When you get jealous.
