"Love Beneath the Stars"
(Episode 6)

2
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,689
As the year comes to an end,

3
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:35,351
I would like to express
gratitude from us, me and Him.

4
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:40,432
As you go off to college,

5
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:43,632
I hope you take the memories
you made here in Journey.

6
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:45,721
Each moment made here is special

7
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:48,999
because it came from our Lord, Jesus.

8
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,945
That is why our senior travelers

9
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,414
have prepared something for us.

10
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,290
Thank you so much for that Bro. Mike

11
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:03,773
and thank you to everyone here
at Journey with the Lord.

12
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:07,732
To the remaining young travelers,

13
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:10,515
we hope you take good care
of this organization the way we have.

14
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,784

Thank you!
Thank you, Bro. Mike!

25
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,280
Take care of Journey. Thank you!

26
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:14,741
Dominic.

27
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,129
Hi.

28
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:18,191
Hi.

29
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:19,685
Can we talk? I...

30
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,538
Luke, I have stuff to do. Sorry.

31
00:03:58,657 --> 00:03:59,324
Heads...

32
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,633
I'll fight for it.

33
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,178
Tails...

34
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,905
I'll let it go.

35
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,577
Fr. Giboy's decision is fair

36
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:36,000
because Dominic
didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,246
I can't believe he lifted your suspension.

38
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,772
Shouldn't we be thanking Luke?

39
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:46,685
He doubled his suspension

40
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,053
so that it wouldn't affect.

41
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:50,194
Dominic's chances at being Valedictorian.

42
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,382
Why should I thank him?

43
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:54,866
It was his fault in the first place.

44
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:04,366
Dominic.

45
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,465
Honey, let him be.

46
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,617
No matter how many times you ask,

47
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,811
it won't change the message of the cards.

48
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,212
But the third sign hasn't happened yet?

49
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,850
Whether it happens or not,

50
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:19,561
you can't do anything unless
Dominic changes his decision.

51
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:05,530
Pens down. Pass your papers.

52
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,012
This is the last day of your exams.

53
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,160
Thank you and good luck to all of you.

54
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,632
Papers in front.

55
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,163
I spoke to Coach Jamil

56
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,655
and the results of your tryouts came in.

57
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:22,741
Unfortunately, Ateneo won't get you.

58
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,514
It's not because of the video.

59
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,944
They have enough people
for the position suited for you.

60
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,710
It's okay, Coach.

61
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,126
But don't lose hope yet.

62
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,301
I spoke to the Coach of UST

63
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:38,035
and a Coach from Baguio.

64
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:40,217
They want to know if you're interested.

65
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:43,944
And if you are, you need to
start training right away.

66
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,210
Thank you, Coach.

67
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,967
And I'm sorry for all
the trouble I've caused you.

68
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:52,952
It's nothing.

69
00:06:53,148 --> 00:06:54,972
You guys are high school students.

70
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,757
It's a given that you guys
will cause headaches.

71
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,467
Hi, son!

72
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,835
Why are you cooking?

73
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,234
No reason.

74
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,366
We wrapped up early
so I figured I'd cook for you.

75
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,264
Is that adobo?

76
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:14,577
What else would it be?

77
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,803
This is the only thing
I know how to cook.

78
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:20,952
Ma?

79
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,185
I didn't get in to Ateneo.

80
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:27,405
Thank God!

81
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,797
What? Why?

82
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:33,840
It's expensive there.
I can't afford it.

83
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:38,796
Okay. I guess it's an answered prayer.

84
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,233
But...

85
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,108
Dominic got in.

86
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:51,757
It's okay, you can FaceChat and stuff.

87
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,647
He hasn't been replying to me.

88
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,147
So you're giving up?

89
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,733
Is it still worth fighting for?

90
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:06,842
I don't know with you.

91
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,202
Only you can answer that.

92
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:15,178
It's easy to give up, but...

93
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,667
It feels better to fight
for the person you love.

94
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,561
Don't do what your father did.

95
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,928
Suddenly left and didn't even try.

96
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:31,632
Okay, let's eat. Yummy adobo.

97
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:33,569
At least it won't leave you.

98
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,975
Thank you, Ma.

99
00:08:57,546 --> 00:09:00,090
Dominic. Food is ready.

100
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,557
Chris, John...

101
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:34,858
- Timmy. Miguel.
- Yes, Luke.

102
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,982
Today is the last batch
of Journey, right?

103
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:39,884
Is Dominic going?

104
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:43,037
Auntie Faye didn't allow him.

105
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,021
Why?

106
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:46,237
He's grounded 'til graduation.

107
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,447
So sad.

108
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,382
Why?

109
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,569
I have a favor to ask.

110
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,802
I really want to talk to him.

111
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,378
Could you go to his house and
ask him to meet up with me?

112
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:58,739
We're banned from his house.

113
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,014
It's like Auntie Faye
hates all gay people.

114
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,053
Shit.

115
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:05,999
He's not replying to any of my texts.

116
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,218
I think I know someone who can help you.

117
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,546
Who?

118
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:18,677
Sorry for calling you this weekend.

119
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,553
No, it's okay.

120
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,162
I wasn't doing much anyway
since the school year is ending.

121
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:25,134
What's up?

122
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:30,335
Gio.

123
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:33,202
I know we're not close

124
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,638
but I really need your help.

125
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:43,007
Is this about Dominic?

126
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,366
Yes.

127
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,765
I really want to talk to him one last time.

128
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,209
But he's not answering me.

129
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,323
And you know I can't go
to his place so...

130
00:10:57,348 --> 00:11:01,603
You want me to go and convince
him to speak to you, yes?

131
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,241
Yes.

132
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,632
I was hoping you'd do that.

133
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:12,296
And why would I do that for you?

134
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,834
You're not doing it for me.

135
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,343
But for Dominic.

136
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,874
What are you doing here?

137
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,616
Visiting you.

138
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:55,346
Am I not allowed to swing by?

139
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,507
Wow, Mom let you in.

140
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:01,577
We both know
I'm Auntie Faye's favorite.

141
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:05,724
Hey.

142
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,389
You okay?

143
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:09,983
What do you think?

144
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,835
I think you're going to be okay
because I'm here.

145
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,718
Gio, I'm not in the mood today.

146
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:26,929
I remember the last time I was here

147
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,905
was first year high school.

148
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:34,670
You were boasting that you finished
the 7th book of Harry Potter

149
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:38,436
because you knew that you
could read faster than me.

150
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,686
Since I'm competitive,

151
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:45,514
I said I finished it even though I didn't.

152
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:52,645
Then you tested me
on the details of the book

153
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,983
and I couldn't answer.

154
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,647
You were so happy because you
knew I was just pretending.

155
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:04,990
Then you said that J.K. Rowling

156
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,097
admitted that Dumbledore was gay.

157
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:10,108
That made you so happy.

158
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,327
Then I thought,
why did it make you so happy?

159
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,921
And, boom.

160
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,264
You said that you were
just like Dumbledore.

161
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,663
Then?

162
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,897
You said

163
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:39,725
what?

164
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:41,609
You're both old?

165
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,397
Then I said...

166
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:47,772
No,

167
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:49,569
we're both gay.

168
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:52,952
Then you walked out

169
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,202
and our friendship was over.

170
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,061
I didn't know how to handle
situations like that at the time.

171
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,843
It's okay, Gio.

172
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,722
It's not like I asked for an apology

173
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,357
from my best friend who left me hanging.

174
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,615
It made me sad
but I forgot about it already.

175
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:16,450
What's your point?

176
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,147
Nothing.

177
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:21,248
You're wasting my time.

178
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,279
Nothing.

179
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,545
I'm just trying to make you laugh.

180
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,045
Stop sulking, it doesn't
suit you. You look silly.

181
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:35,996
You know what Dominic,

182
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:37,818
you're one of the bravest people I know.

183
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:41,677
Think about it.

184
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,224
We were only fourteen,

185
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,107
You had the courage to accept
that you are gay.

186
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,582
You embraced it.

187
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,672
Even though you know life
isn't fair to people like you.

188
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,060
It didn't stop you.

189
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,568
You fought for it.

190
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:05,084
Even if it meant you'd lose
people along the way.

191
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,731
It's better to lose people
than lose myself.

192
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:12,982
Exactly.

193
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,614
That's why it's time to get yourself back.

194
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,341
I know your problem with your family,

195
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,260
that you're afraid to disappoint them.

196
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,513
You're afraid to hurt them.

197
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,607
But Dominic, don't forget
what makes you happy.

198
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,091
And we both know it's Luke.

199
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,388
Luke spoke to me.

200
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:57,420
He wants to talk to you one
last time before we graduate.

201
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,685
You owe it to him.

202
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,123
You owe it more to yourself.

203
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,814
You deserve to be happy.

204
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,098
Choose to be happy.

205
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,029
Why are you doing this?

206
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:24,193
Because I want you to be happy, Dominic.

207
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:37,492
Do you want to know a secret?

208
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:40,787
What?

209
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:43,433
I'm like Dumbledore, too.

210
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,798
What? You're both old, too?

211
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,916
I hope one day...

212
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:36,698
I can be as brave as Luke.

213
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,183
Bye, Dominic.

214
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,135
Thank you for meeting up with me.

215
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:08,881
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,724
Why do we keep apologizing to each other?

217
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,615
I feel like... that's all
we've been doing lately.

218
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:19,521
By the way, I didn't get in to Ateneo.

219
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,240
You didn't get in because of the video?

220
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:26,810
No. I think I'm just not
good enough for the team.

221
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,201
So, it wasn't your fault.

222
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:36,361
Mom and I spoke the other day.

223
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:42,146
She told me not to give up on us.

224
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:48,232
Even though, I think you want to...

225
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,539
Are you giving up on us?

226
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,592
It's not that simple, Luke.

227
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,332
Because it's not about us anymore.

228
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,396
My family's involved

229
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,592
and your family...

230
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,927
and both our futures.

231
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:10,380
Why would that stop you from loving me?

232
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:12,604
Because in loving you,

233
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:16,068
many people will get hurt.

234
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,573
I can't be selfish like that.

235
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:21,290
So it's okay if you get hurt?

236
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,153
You know what Dominic,

237
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,568
I will not force you to be with me.

238
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,208
That's not why I wanted
to meet up with you.

239
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,740
I just want proper closure.

240
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,571
We owe that to ourselves.

241
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:48,029
If you really don't love me...

242
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,768
Then please, tell me that
you don't love me anymore.

243
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,920
So I can let you go.

244
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,974
Because in letting you go,

245
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,578
then...

246
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,935
maybe the pain will be less
every time I want to hug you

247
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,107
and kiss you, or even just be with you.

248
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,404
I'm sorry, Luke. I have to go now.

249
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:28,966
Dominic, wait.

250
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:44,895
Thank you for showing me...

251
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,435
that I can love like this.

252
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,123
No matter what happens,

253
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,310
I will always, always love you.

254
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,551
I'm not as brave as you, Luke.

Congrats! Oh my God!

265
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:42,966
(Congrats! Dominic... Valedictorian of Class2020)
You did it! You take after me.

266
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,636
Hey... Valedictorian...

267
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:48,372
Oh, they're separated...

268
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:50,802
- I'll check.
- Oh, wow.

269
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,443
Hey, have you eaten?

270
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,146
I made it.

271
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,613
I'm the Valedictorian.

272
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,841
Oh my God! Oh my God!

273
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,560
- I knew you could do it.
- That's amazing!

274
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,497
Congratulations.

275
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:07,716
I'm so proud.

276
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,721
Are you okay, son?

277
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:19,661
I'm sorry.

278
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,575
Son?

279
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,154
Dominic.

280
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:56,060
What's the problem, son?

281
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:58,931
I don't know, Dad.

282
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:07,186
Are you not happy
about being Valedictorian?

283
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:12,235
Of course I am but...

284
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:16,450
But you only did it for us.

285
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,786
I honor you for it.

286
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:23,724
You're a good son,

287
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:25,849
always putting us first before yourself.

288
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,708
Because I love you.

289
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:32,310
I know.

290
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:37,708
Are you afraid of us?

291
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,469
No, I'm not.

292
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:55,560
Dominic,

293
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,169
I know.

294
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,198
I know you love Luke.

295
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,291
And you're keeping yourself
from loving him

296
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,560
because you don't want us to get hurt.

297
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,576
But the truth is...

298
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:23,263
it hurts us more
when we see you this way.

299
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:34,912
All I ever wanted was to make
you and Mommy proud of me.

300
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:40,248
It's my way of...

301
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,654
compensating for turning out to be...

302
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,523
Gay?

303
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:56,541
What's wrong with being gay?

304
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:04,497
Even though you never
talked about it or mentioned it

305
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,057
your mom and I always knew

306
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,638
and we're so proud of you.

307
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:15,555
What we did wrong was...

308
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,542
that we never made you feel
like your choice was okay.

309
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:21,755
That we were okay.

310
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:26,294
And for that,

311
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,099
I am so sorry, because...

312
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,536
that was our fault as parents, not yours.

313
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:43,951
Dominic,

314
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,500
it is not wrong to love.

315
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:52,954
Everyone has a right to love
and be loved back.

316
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,447
Don't deprive yourself because of us.

317
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:05,491
Your happiness as a person

318
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:08,697
is the most important thing
to me and your Mom.

319
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:12,960
And there's no school award or honor

320
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:14,775
that can compensate for that.

321
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,321
You should go see Luke.

322
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,338
But Dad, I hurt him already.

323
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:26,353
That's part of love.

324
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,258
I'm very proud of you.

325
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:52,698
It's been a while since I've seen you.

326
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:56,783
I know, there's a lot going on.

327
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,080
Are things good with Mr. Cutie?

328
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,618
Actually, that's the reason why I'm here.

329
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,749
I don't know what to do.

330
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:08,868
Because?

331
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:11,520
I think it's too late.

332
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,437
My God, stop with the "too late" speak.

333
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,688
You're too young to say such things.

334
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,994
Melodramatic, isn't it?

335
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,595
I don't know anymore.
You take me way too seriously.

336
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,653
Okay, let's open the deck.

337
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,350
Isn't this the third sign I gave you?

338
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:41,455
The Fool card and the World card.

339
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,800
The cards are saying
you are the third sign.

340
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,690
Me?

341
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,729
Yes. This is you.

342
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:51,751
You're the Fool.
Because first of all,

343
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:54,705
why would you let go
of someone that cute?

344
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,770
Most importantly, you're at that point

345
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,807
where you can choose to leap

346
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,594
or stay right where you are.

347
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,963
The decision is yours.

348
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,908
Remember this, Dominic,

349
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,721
love is a gamble.

350
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,923
It is not for cowards.

351
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:31,502
Fr. Giboy,

352
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:36,016
to our faculty, to the administrators,

353
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:38,307
parents,

354
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:41,514
and to my fellow students
here with me today,

355
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,705
good day!

356
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,111
In a few minutes we will graduate.

357
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,502
In a few minutes...

358
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:58,158
the experiences we shared here
will be distant memories.

359
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,147
Ever since grade school,

360
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:03,381
I grew up here.

361
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:06,025
Confined within the walls of this school.

362
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:09,610
People say, it's hard to study
at a Catholic school.

363
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:14,014
Because of too many rules,
prohibitions, and limitations.

364
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,921
But during my time here, I realized

365
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:19,033
I also had a lot to learn.

366
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,596
Love was one of them.

367
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:23,025
Here at St. Francis,

368
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:25,799
I was taught how to love

369
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:29,861
and how God created us to love.

370
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:37,775
God gave us the power
to choose who to love.

371
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,846
At first glance, it seems easy to do

372
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,799
but why is it hard to fight for?

373
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:51,823
Yes, it's easy to choose who to love

374
00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:54,150
but how you show the love,

375
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,080
that's the hard part.

376
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:03,643
That's what needs dedication.

377
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:07,713
Because life is not that simple.

378
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:12,417
There are many struggles we have to face

379
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:15,963
that will test our integrity.

380
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,635
But no matter how hard it gets,

381
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:23,760
we need to be brave like Christ.

382
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,971
Who chose to be unwaveringly brave for us.

383
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:32,502
He sacrificed his life for us.

384
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:35,690
In self-sacrifice,

385
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:42,447
and in facing hardships

386
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:44,783
is when we become stronger.

387
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:51,822
Our love deepens for the people
we choose to love.

388
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:54,989
That's why today,

389
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,182
before I leave the school
that taught me how to love,

390
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:03,463
I will be brave.

391
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,091
Because there's no greater joy

392
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:10,135
than the freedom to love someone
with all your heart.

393
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:15,267
So right here, right now.

394
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,003
I would like to say
in front of everyone here,

395
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:22,767
that with every fiber of my being,

396
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,609
I love Luke Armada.

397
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,252
It's okay.

398
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,440
I love you, Luke.

399
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:39,409
And I will always love you.

400
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:43,959
Thank you, St. Francis
for teaching me how to love.

401
00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:46,354
I will take this with me wherever I go.

402
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,010
Congratulations, Batch 2020!

403
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:51,010
Don't be afraid to love!

404
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,158
I'm speechless.

405
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,432
Just like you said.

406
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,002
Fuck it.
