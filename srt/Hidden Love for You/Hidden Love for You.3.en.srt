190
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,240
Duan Jiaxu of Bed No.5.

191
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,000
The procedure is done.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
You can check out now.

193
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,510
You can leave already?

194
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
That's right, sir.

195
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,000
Have a good rest.

196
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Hope you'll get well soon.

197
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,830
Okay.

198
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,470
Get along well with your girl.

199
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,510
Okay, sir.

200
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,200
We'll get married soon.

201
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
Thank you, sir.

202
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,390
I should go, sir.

203
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,960
Okay.

204
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,720
Nice.

205
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,670
Let's get married soon.

206
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,240
You started that, huh?

207
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,310
Are you angry?

208
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
No.

209
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,080
Jiaxu,

210
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
don't say anything like that.

211
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,880
When you don't like me,

212
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,310
don't make such a joke.

213
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:57,960
Let's go.

214
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,670
I have things to do later.

215
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,360
Hey.

216
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,120
Are you

217
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,280
really angry?

218
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm not.

219
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,080
It's my fault.

220
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,280
How about I apologize?

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
No need.

222
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,640
Just don't joke like that anymore.

223
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Come on.

224
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,960
Am I really that terrible?

225
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,920
I upset Sang Zhi so much.

226
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,840
Jiaxu,

227
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
I'll put your laundry
in the washing machine.

228
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,680
No need.

229
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,360
You just take a seat.

230
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,080
I'll do it myself.

231
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,960
But the doctor said,

232
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
you can't do vigorous exercise.

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,080
This isn't vigorous exercise.

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,840
Just sit there.

235
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,160
Oh.

236
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,880
No spicy food.

237
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Drink more water.

238
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
No alcohol.

239
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Get some rest early.

240
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,120
What are you writing?

241
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,760
Just some dos and don'ts.

242
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll put them up.

243
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Care more about yourself anyway.

244
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
Drink more water.

245
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,280
I should go.

246
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,880
I had planned to buy you dinner.

247
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
But you fell sick.

248
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,520
Another time, then.

249
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,880
Don't bother to buy me dinner.

250
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
I'll take you to dinner.

251
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,520
We'll see.

252
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
I have to go.

253
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,440
Let me drive you.

254
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,520
No, thanks. I know the way.

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,200
You...

256
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
Have more vegetables and water.

257
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Bye.

258
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,560
Stay safe.

259
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
Mm. I will.

260
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
Look, your girl is so pretty.

261
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
She takes good care of you.

262
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,920
If you don't cherish her,

263
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,560
you'll regret it.

264
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,280
She's caring, indeed.
