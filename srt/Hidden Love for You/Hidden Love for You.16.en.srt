[Episode 16 A Courtship Foretold]

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,350
Are you looking for me?

8
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,590
But why the kiss?

9
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,590
You're the one who leaned in.

10
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,350
I am.

11
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,840
Because I wanted you to kiss me.

12
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,430
Has Yan contacted you?

13
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,510
No. What's the matter?

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,000
We had a fight.

15
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,120
He insisted
that I should go home this summer.

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,920
And he said...

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
What?

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,510
Did you tell him about us?

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
Not yet.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
I was planning to go back to Nanwu

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,710
with you

22
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,200
and tell him myself.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,950
What's the current plan?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,790
Right now...

25
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,120
Mm.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,230
I'll wait till your internship ends

27
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,400
and let him punch me in person.

28
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,840
I don't think that's necessary.

29
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,790
It's okay.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm willing to take that punch.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
How's the taste?

32
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,000
Not bad.

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,150
Sang Zhi, you're back.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
How was the interview?

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,630
Pretty good.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,430
Where are the girls?

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,800
They went home after exams.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh.

39
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,120
Are you going home too?

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,590
Well, my boyfriend rented a place.

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,710
I'm moving in with him.

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,520
I won't be in the dorm this summer.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,030
I thought
we could keep each other company.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,310
You have Duan.

45
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey,

46
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,030
how does being in love feel?

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,120
Wait, no.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,400
I mean

49
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,150
how does it feel to be with someone

50
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,400
you've liked for so long?

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
Actually...

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,520
Nothing special.

53
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,800
Uh?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,750
Except for the day one.

55
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,280
This

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:07,910
and this.

57
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
Like this.

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,430
Otherwise no difference.

59
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,800
Oh my, you kissed that day?

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,910
Age equals skills, huh?

61
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,630
But I think

62
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,590
my reactions were wrong.

63
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,240
I get nervous when he leans in

64
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,430
and seem unhappy.

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,190
I don't want any misunderstanding.

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,910
So I told him

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,750
I really liked him.

68
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,400
Maybe you're conditioned to be nervous

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,520
from hiding your feelings before.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Probably.

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,030
But you're together now.

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,750
Showing your love

73
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,750
is completely natural.

74
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,240
Hey,

75
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,400
think of it this way.

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,240
He'll be with you for life.

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,240
You can't stay nervous forever.

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,590
You're not usually shy.

79
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,240
Is that a compliment or insult?

80
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,910
I'm heading out now.

81
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,030
Good luck. Bye.

82
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,680
Bye.

83
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
Jiaxu,

84
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,590
wanna try an escape room?

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,750
Sure, I'm free.

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,870
Why do you want to play escape room?

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,830
Because I'm good at it.

88
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm an expert.

89
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,680
Alright.

90
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,720
Duan Jiaxu.

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,510
Why do you call me like that?

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
I'll call you that from now on.

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,920
Not "Brother No. 2" anymore?

94
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,360
I feel like I should change.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
Calling you "brother"

96
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
makes it feel like I'm dating a parent.

97
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,070
And you love telling me what to do.

98
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,270
Do I, though?

99
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,720
Mm.

100
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,480
And I've been meaning to say,

101
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,160
if you keep calling me "kid",

102
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,750
why not have one yourself?

103
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,560
Okay.

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,510
After you graduate,

105
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,600
we'll have one.

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
After graduation?

107
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,920
You'll be thirty.

108
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
What's wrong with that?

109
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
Thirty...

110
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,510
That's late parenthood.

111
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,310
Says who?

112
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,750
Fifty counts as late.

113
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,750
My rules.

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,680
Then I'm not "Brother No. 2" anymore.

115
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,390
Actually, I gave you
another name before.

116
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,360
What?

117
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Pursuer.

118
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,360
And now?

119
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,510
Duan Jiaxu, of course.

120
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,750
Alright.

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,560
Duan Jiaxu.

122
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,510
Mm.

123
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,920
Duan Jiaxu.

124
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,750
Mm.

125
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Duan Jiaxu, Duan Jiaxu, Duan Jiaxu.

126
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
Duan Jiaxu.

127
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
You dropped your bag.

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,870
Duan Jiaxu.

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,310
Yes?

130
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,920
Something is behind this door.

131
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,750
But I don't know the code.

132
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,160
Dear adventurers,

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,310
15 minutes left.

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,480
No time.

135
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,190
Where is the code?

136
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,750
It's open.

137
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,800
How did you get the code?

138
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
There was a math problem earlier.

139
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I solved it.

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
And here it is.

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,750
I tried the answer.

142
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,270
Oh.

143
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,190
I noticed that too.

144
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,310
- Oh?
- Didn't have time to solve it.

145
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,800
The podium drawer has a lock.

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,070
Four-digit.

147
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,560
We need more clues.

148
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,510
Duan Jiaxu.

149
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,950
Yes?

150
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,830
To ease your tension,
I'll tell you something.

151
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,680
What?

152
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,360
I plan to kiss you today.

153
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,870
What?

154
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,920
Get ready.

155
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
So you're informing me?

156
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,720
If you think it's inappropriate,

157
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,270
then forget about it.

158
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,920
I think it's quite appropriate.

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
Who's going to take the first move?

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,870
It'll be me, of course.

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,720
Why can't it be me?

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,430
No way.

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,910
Right now?

164
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,080
No.

165
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,640
We haven't solved the puzzles.

166
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,080
And...

167
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,960
there are cameras.

168
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,320
Then why did you tell me now?

169
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,910
You want me to anticipate it?

170
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,520
I'll go check the door.

171
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,080
Should we play
other escape rooms some day?

172
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,760
This seems too easy for you.

173
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,640
Sure.

174
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,110
I've arrived.

175
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll head back now.

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
Drive safely.

177
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,230
Did you forget something?

178
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,960
Uh?

179
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,910
Hmm.

180
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,840
Oh.

181
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,320
You didn't drive today.

182
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,760
Go catch the subway.

183
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,520
It'll stop running soon.

184
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,430
Okay.

I told you earlier

188
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
to be prepared.

189
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,030
