[Episode 24 Hidden Love For You]

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,350
When I was little, my mom told me

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,240
something good always follows

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,560
after every storm.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,840
Everything will be okay.

11
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,920
And so will you.

12
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,880
I know.

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,480
Here, have a candy.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,230
Feeling better now?

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
Kind of.

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,870
Is Jiang Ying still bothering you?

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,480
I talked to her.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,150
She won't bother us anymore.

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,510
Can I run something by you?

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm going to

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,120
quit my job and open a studio in Nanwu.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,870
That soon?

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,510
If you don't like the idea,

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,280
I can stay here for two more years

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
with you.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,280
After that, I'll quit.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,510
It's okay.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
If you're heading back,

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,510
when are you leaving?

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
Next week.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Where will you stay?

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,920
Qian Fei found me a rental.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,870
I'll stay there.

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
He also recommended
some new places for sale.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,280
I'll check them out if I have time.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,510
Or...

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,070
we can check them out together

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
when you're back.

39
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,870
Buying a place in Nanwu

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,950
is no less expensive...

41
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,870
Come on, there's no rush.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,840
You know,

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,150
I have some savings.

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,310
Not much,

45
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,680
but enough for a down payment.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,680
What I mean is,

47
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,240
I can't expect you

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,590
to have what I don't even have myself.

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,190
But you do.

50
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,030
I'll buy it for you.

51
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,000
Huh?

52
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,470
Just share
half of your bed with me.

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,630
Deal.

54
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,400
Then should you cancel

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
your current lease?

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,710
That'd be a waste.

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
Let's keep it.

58
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,590
You said

59
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,360
your dorm is uncomfortable.

60
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,680
You can move in.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,280
And don't drink so much when you go out.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,150
If guys ask for your WeChat,

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,910
just give them mine.

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,310
You behave too.

65
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,080
No flirting.

66
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,710
When do I ever flirt?

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
No flirting with guys either.

68
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,430
I never do that.

69
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,800
Anyway, no flirting.

70
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,190
Don't worry,

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
I'll update you every day

72
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,750
on the studio's progress.

73
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,470
Okay.

74
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,710
Are you nervous?

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,030
Want some water?

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
No? Then get me some.

77
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,710
Duan, Sang Yan,

78
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,560
dinner's ready.

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,150
Ma'am.

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,840
Coming, Mom.

81
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
Go away.

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,710
I mooched meals here

83
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,360
all through my school days.

84
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,120
Ma'am, your cooking
is as good as ever.

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
You flatter me.

86
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
Time really flies.

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Feels like

88
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,280
you just started college,

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
and now

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,430
even Zhizhi is about to graduate.

91
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,520
Exactly.

92
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,840
Sir,

93
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,560
I've been thinking a lot

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,080
about the concerns

95
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,680
you raised.

96
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,680
Today, I want to

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
address everything clearly.

98
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,710
I paid full compensation

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,310
for my father's accident,

100
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,030
but the victim's daughter

101
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,630
kept harassing us.

102
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,870
Please rest assured,

103
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,720
it's been resolved now.

104
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,510
But it still affected Sang Zhi.

105
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,240
I owe you an apology.

106
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,070
Glad it's settled.

108
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,920
It wasn't your fault.

109
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,510
My studio prep is almost done.

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,270
I'll go see a few places soon.

111
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
If I find the right one,

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
I'll buy it.

113
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,480
I want Zhizhi to have a better life.

114
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,750
I can't change my family background,

115
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,560
but I promise you

116
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,270
I'll cherish Zhizhi forever.

117
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,560
That takes actions,

118
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,390
not just promises.

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
Wait, Dad.

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Isn't this a bit harsh?

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:02,870
Well,

122
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,830
I never heard of us

123
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,800
having

124
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,480
such strict standards.

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,390
Let me put it this way,

126
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,630
if Zhizhi dated some rich guy

127
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
who has no goals

128
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
and just drifts through life,

129
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,000
is that what you'd want?

130
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,920
That's not the point.

131
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,920
Mom, look at him.

132
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,390
Sure,

133
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,600
he's worse than me

134
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,630
in every way,

135
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,680
but he's decent.

136
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,950
Don't flatter yourself.

137
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,920
The point is,

138
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,630
he treats Zhizhi incredibly well

139
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,830
and doesn't have any serious flaws.

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,190
Sang Yan,

141
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,600
let your father finish.

142
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,070
You're not even engaged yet,

143
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,120
and you've decided
to put the house in her name?

144
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,830
Mm.

145
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Kid,

146
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,070
no one invests that much

147
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,600
in a relationship.

148
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,480
If people hear about this,

149
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,680
they'll think

150
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,480
we pressured you.

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,870
Keep the house in your name.

152
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
Honestly,

153
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,240
we're not after

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
any of that.

155
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,680
What we said before

156
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,830
was just to see how you'd respond.

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,390
I understand.

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,310
We're not unreasonable.

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
What you said today

160
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,870
is enough.

161
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,390
We believe you'll treat her well.

162
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,240
Exactly.

163
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,070
Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am.

164
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,160
Alright, enough talk.

165
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,950
Let's eat.

166
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,830
The food's getting cold.

167
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,830
Thank you.

168
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,680
Come on.

169
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,070
I was just about to call you.

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,510
I've got good news.

171
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
Me too.

172
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Really? You first.

173
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,040
Remember that competition?

174
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,070
I won.

175
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,630
Really?

176
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,920
Yeah, third prize.

177
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
That's amazing.

178
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,270
Wait till I get back.

179
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,390
We'll celebrate.

180
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,630
Definitely.

181
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,920
What about you?

182
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,510
What's your news?

183
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
I...

184
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,680
I just met your parents.

185
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,750
They...

186
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,040
gave us their blessing.

187
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,390
What?

188
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,270
Really?

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Yeah.

190
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,510
Duan Jiaxu.

191
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,310
Hmm?

192
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,360
From now on, no one,

193
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,480
not even you,
gets to say you're unworthy

194
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,390
because of your family.

195
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,240
To me, you're the best.

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,510
Alright.

197
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,950
Got it.

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,240
[Six months later]

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Dad.

200
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,560
Dad, did you know?

201
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:17,800
Hmm?

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,920
This game was made by Jiaxu's studio.

203
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,430
Oh.

204
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,870
Yes.

205
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,750
Hit that one.

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,430
This one?

207
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,070
Jiaxu.

208
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,510
Hmm?

209
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,750
Can you grab the plate
from Zhizhi's room.

210
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,720
She left it after her snack.

211
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,480
On it.

212
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,870
Behind you!

213
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,840
Attack!

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,870
Watch out!

215
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,270
My dreams:

216
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,910
First,

217
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,030
Yihe University.

218
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,630
Second...

219
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,030
Dinner's ready, Jiaxu.

220
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
Second,

221
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Duan Jiaxu.

222
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,030
The unrequited love

223
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,630
I thought I'd hide forever

224
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,150
turned into something

225
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,750
I couldn't even hide if I tried.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,390
Now,

227
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,080
there's no need to.

228
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
Because

229
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,360
from this moment on,

230
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,510
those unstoppable dreams

231
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,510
helped us become

232
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,150
the best versions of ourselves.

234
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,850

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,470

♪If I can't cover
