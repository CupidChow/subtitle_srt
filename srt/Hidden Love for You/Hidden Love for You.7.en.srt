[Episode 7 Secret in the Bracelet]

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,600
Did you get home?

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,320
Yes!

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,390
Jiaxu,

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,400
my brother seems to have a girlfriend.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,710
She's rather young, I think.

12
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,200
She can't be a minor, anyway.

13
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,150
So, a girl just needs to come of age?

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
After she came of age,

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
graduated from high school,

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
and went to college,

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,000
she would be an adult.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,840
What's the problem, then?

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,430
She was just

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,590
asking about her brother, right?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If it happens to her,

22
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,150
she'll hardly accept it, I guess.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,510
After all,

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,950
she only treats me like a brother.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,590
Why did Jiaxu

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,400
suddenly say that to me?

27
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,150
Is he

28
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,280
implying something?

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,200
Rationally speaking,

30
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,240
he's only six or seven years older.

31
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,030
That's not a huge age gap.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,150
But in his eyes,

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm always the 13-year-old kid.

34
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,400
If...

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,150
I mean if...

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
If you no longer treat me like a kid...

37
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,190
I won't pursue you, anyway.

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,120
I have pursuers, okay?

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,520
And you're quite old.

40
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,400
You'll even have wrinkles
in a few years.

41
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,960
In your dreams.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,590
Duan Jiaxu, you haven't been
back in Nanwu for a while.

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,590
Are you so busy with work?

44
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,030
Yeah.

45
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,400
I've been quite busy lately.

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,190
Such a silly question.

47
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,750
He invested in technology.

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,190
He has to work hard.

49
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,080
He's my big brother.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,470
Oh.

51
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,360
Hey, big brother.

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,590
Don't listen to him.

53
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,310

Hey, Qian.

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Sang Yan!

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,280
Wish you a happy wedding.

58
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
Thanks.

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,590
Come on. Take your seats.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
Duan Jiaxu, you quite enjoyed yourself.

61
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,400
You didn't even tell me you were here.

62
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,960
Call me big brother

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,560
and I'll give you a red envelope.

64
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,030
Uncle gave that to me.

65
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,310
Give it back.

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,590
Thank you, big brother.

67
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,590
You're welcome.

68
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,080
Give it back.

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh, brother.

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,630
Give it back.

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,120
From now on, you'll be my big brother.

72
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,150
Hey, are you insane?

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm not.

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,120
Thank you for your concern.

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,590
You guys, that's enough.

76
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,190
Brother.

77
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,870
Kid,

78
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,430
don't call me brother now.

79
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,590
This word

80
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,520
makes me sick.

81
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,560
- Qian Fei.
- Yep.

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,710
I'm going to the bathroom.

83
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,520
Go ahead.

84
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,560
Zhizhi, Dad bought you chocolate cake.

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,750
It's in the fridge.

86
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,080
Eat it when you're back tonight.

87
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,560
Mm, okay.

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,630
Who is Zhizhi?

89
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,630
Why do you ask?

90
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,120
Is that your brother?

91
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,750
Nonsense.

92
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,950
It's me.

93
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,950
It's my nickname.

94
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,120
Who usually calls you that?

95
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,430
People close to me.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
Then, who is "Brother No.2"?

97
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
He's No.1. You're No.2.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why am I No.2?

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,240
Because you're older than him.

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
So, you're No.2.

101
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,190
Any problem?

102
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,560
But I look younger.

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,600
Jiaxu,

104
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,360
were you hit in the pride aspect?

105
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,720
Did girls complain about your age

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
when you had blind dates?

107
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,950
Blind dates?

108
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,720
Mm.

109
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,390
Oh, right.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,750
You asked your brother and me
to have blind dates.

111
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,120
I just want you

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,950
to accompany each other.

113
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
Then, you'll be confident.

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,390
But your brother doesn't want that.

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
How about this?

116
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,160
You and I will go together.

117
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
What's wrong?

118
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,950
You don't want to go?

119
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,360
How can I go with you?

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,310
Anyway,

121
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,750
people will complain if you take me.

122
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,630
About what?

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
About taking a daughter for blind dates.

124
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,800
Ask him to shut up.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,870
You haven't enjoyed yourself.

126
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,480
Come on.

127
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,510
I won't drink anymore.

128
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,750
Let's keep drinking. Come on.

129
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,360
Brother.

130
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,630
Huh?

131
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,000
Kid,

132
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,040
you go home.

133
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,950
Go home without me.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,430
Just go. Don't worry.

135
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,070
Okay.

136
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
- Come on.
- Be careful.

137
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,270
Let's go.

138
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,120
Come on.

139
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,390
Let's go.

140
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,800
I'll get you home.

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,950
Jiaxu, don't bother.

142
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,630
You should go with them.

143
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,950
Helping someone else may bother me.

144
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,190
But getting you home

145
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,190
will not.

146
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,950
Come on.

147
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,310
Mm.

148
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,750
When are you going back to school?

149
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,360
Tomorrow.

150
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,390
When is your flight?

151
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
At twenty past eight.

152
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,630
What a coincidence.
That's also my flight.

153
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,630
How about you go together?

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Oh.

155
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,190
Hey.

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,950
Huh?

157
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,750
Take it back, Zhizhi.

158
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,630
Why do you always call me that?

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,950
Because you said

160
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,190
only those close to you
could call you that.

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
Jiaxu,

162
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,800
when you see Qian Fei get married,

163
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,920
do you also want

164
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,390
a girlfriend?

165
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,360
Why do you keep asking me
to get a girlfriend

166
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
or have a blind date?

167
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm just 25.

168
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,870
Be patient, please.

169
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,750
Then, when will you have a girlfriend?

170
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,190
Even my brother has a pursuer.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,310
If you're all alone,

172
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,830
nobody will look after you
when you're sick.

173
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,310
Don't be upset.

174
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,560
I just don't want you to be alone.

175
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,390
Fine, I won't bring it up again.

176
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,870
Oh.

177
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,830
How old are you?

178
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,040
I'll turn 19 after this year's birthday.

179
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,920
Not until you're 20.

180
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,600
Thanks, Jiaxu.

181
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,800
The flight leaves tomorrow morning.

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Go to bed early.

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,950
I should go home.

184
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,870
Okay.

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Zhizhi.

186
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,240
Huh?

187
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
New-year present for you.

188
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,190
Take it.

189
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Go back.

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,630

[A man gives a woman a bracelet...]

201
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,720
If a man gives a woman a bracelet,

202
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,200
it means he likes her.

203
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,510
If it's from an elder,

204
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
it means he cares for her.

205
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,510
Why do you keep me guessing?

206
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,310
Hey, Duan Jiaxu.

207
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
Don't keep me guessing, okay?

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Just tell me.

209
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,160
What kind of guy?

210
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,950
A Mr. Charming.

211
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,670
As far as I see,

212
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,190
he must be

213
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,600
reservedly wild,

214
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,070
cunning,

215
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,950
and thick-skinned.

216
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,790
Come on, bro.

217
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,120
She...

218
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Was she just talking about you?

219
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,950
Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,160
Hey, think about it.

221
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,000
I've never seen this girl.

222
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
But you think carefully.

223
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,950
Maybe she was just talking about you.

224
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,950
I don't think so.

225
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,360
But...

226
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,000
You may have a point there.

227
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,670
Hey.

228
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,400
Fine, then.

229
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,710
This conversation is over.

230
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,600
Have a good trip tomorrow.

231
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll see you around.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,760
Wait.

233
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
I'll ask you one more time.

234
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,310
Do you really think

235
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,670
I'm like Mr. Charming?

236
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,310
Yes.

237
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,030
You're just like him.

238
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,120
