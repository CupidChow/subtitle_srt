Yes.

Mm.

Since you've kissed me,

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,920
you must be responsible for me.

27
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,000

00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,310

No.

No. Say no more.

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,430
Fine.

42

Will you?

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,750
Jiaxu, don't stare at me like that.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,310
Why do you think it's the perfect time?

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,750
You screwed up my plan, you know?

You've got a plan?

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,280
Of course.

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,190
I had a plan.

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,030
That's so old-fashioned.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,030
Old-fashioned?

57
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,430
Mm.

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,190
Isn't it the popular way in college?

59
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,590
Then, what's your speech?

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,910
"Sang Zhi, I adore you.

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,240
Please be my girlfriend."

62
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,000
So serious?

63
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,840
I have to be serious for this occasion.

64
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll make it up to you.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Don't bother.

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,150

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,520
You don't need to.

68
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,800
The sense of ceremony.

69
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,400
You even care about that?

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,400
Because you care about that.

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,240

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,870

73
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,150
Is it really your first love?

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,750
Yes.

75
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Why? Laugh at me?

76
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,710
No, no.

77
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,560
I never told you

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,910
about my family, right?

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Jiaxu,

80
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,960
you don't have to
if you don't want to tell me.

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

82
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,040
My mother passed away.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
My father killed someone in a DUI.

84
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,510
He's been in a vegetative state.

85
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,070
And I...

86
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,000
I have a car, but no flat.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I have some savings.

88
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,390
Don't feel uncomfortable.

89
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,430
I just think...

90
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,240
Since we're in a relationship,

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,510
I should make everything clear to you.

92
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm not feeling uncomfortable.

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,120
Jiaxu.

94
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,750
Huh?

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,190
Does this upset you?

96
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm not upset.

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,390
I'm just

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,310
a little bit nervous.

99
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Why?

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,190
I doubt if you mind.

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
I don't mind.

102
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,510
Actually, I met Jiang Ying today.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,360
She said something about your father.

104
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
She talked to you?

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,390
Sort of.

106
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,600
Don't let her brainwash you.

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,560
She's never responsible
for anything she says.

108
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,950
If you meet her again,

109
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,310
tell her to see a doctor.

110
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,800
And...

111
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,630
I don't think a flat is a necessity.

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,510
But if you really want one,

113
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,560
please wait for me.

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll buy you a flat after I graduate.

115
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,360
Okay.

116
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,160
I'll wait, then.

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,950
Just a small one.

118
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,190
I prefer a big one.

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Here I am.

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,070
Mm.

121
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,950
I'll go back, then.

122
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,720
Okay.

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,720
Bye-bye.

124
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Bye.

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,510
Hey, Duan.

126
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Let me tell you something.

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,430
Go ahead.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,390
Keep an eye

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,510
on my sister's boyfriend.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
When she's there alone,

131
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,950
don't let anyone fool her.

132
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Okay.

133
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,190
Bye.

134
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,560
I'll put on my shoes and go out.

135
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,430
Send me your location, then.

136
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,870
Okay.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,480
Get closer.

138
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,720
Hey.

139
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,000
Where are you?

140
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm outside the door.

141
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,720
Oh.

142
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm buying coffee. Do you see me?

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Okay.

144
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,480
Excuse me.

145
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,310
Can I add you on WeChat?

146
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,830
I don't think so.

147
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,430
If my girlfriend knows,

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,630
she'll kill me.

149
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,190
Sorry, then.

150
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,510
Are you angry?

151
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,190
No. Why would I?

152
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,040
Then why don't you say anything?

153
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,800
She wanted to befriend you,

154
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,830
not me.

155
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,510
I rejected her.

156
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,800
So, I didn't complain.

157
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,240
You're indicating,

158
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,360
"I'm jealous."

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,390
Not at all.

160
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,480
Are you sure?

161
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,950
Did I get you wrong?

162
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,430
I really think you're jealous.

163
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
So, you are not?

164
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,040
Why didn't you wait for me

165
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,360
without doing anything?

166
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
What did I do?

167
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,160
You gave her the vibe.

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Vibe?

169
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,430
Why would someone want to befriend you

170
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,720
if you hadn't done anything?

171
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Then describe that.

172
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
How did I give her the vibe?

173
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,120
How narrow-minded.

174
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,190
That's you.

175
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,240
I'll go get

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,120
the coffee.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Okay.

178
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
Here's your coffee. Take it.

179
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,190
Thanks.

180
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,750
Excuse me. May I add you on WeChat?

181
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,800
Sorry,

182
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,190
but I have a boyfriend.

183
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,950
We can add each other.

184
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,950
Let's just be friends.

185
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,840
Did that young man ask
to add you on WeChat?

186
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
No.

187
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,080
- No?
- He asked me for directions.

188
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,600
I gave him directions.

189
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,600
But I saw you give him the vibe.

190
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Why couldn't you behave yourself

191
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,510
when getting the coffee?

192
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,910
I think

193
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,750
we're even now.

194
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,910
Let me look at you closely.

195
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,200
You've dressed up carefully.

196
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,200
I take back whatever I just did.

197
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,910
What did you say to him?

198
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,630
I said I had a boyfriend.

199
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,720
What did you say?

200
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,000
Boyfriend.

201
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,030
Mm.

202
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,910
Why are you available today?

203
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,030
Don't mention it.

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
We have a power failure.

205
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't review my lessons anywhere.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,840
Mm.

207
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,600
That's good.

208
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,550
Not at all.

209
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,790
I had planned
to review my lessons in the library,

210
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,320
but all the seats were taken.

211
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,240
Go to my home, then.

212
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,910
It's better than the library.

213
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,750
Are you sure
you don't want anything else?

214
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,480
No.

215
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,550
You won't disturb me?

216
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,510
Definitely not.

217
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,120
Fine, then.

218
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,870
♪If we meet again, don't hug me♪

219
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,970
♪I don't want it this way♪

220
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,590
♪I can't see or force a smile♪

221
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,070
♪I'll just forget it♪

222
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,270
♪If I can't cover
the corners of my eyes♪

223
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,860
♪How will my tears roll down?♪

224
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:26,820
♪You actually know it's so hard for me♪
