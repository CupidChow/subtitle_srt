[Episode 23 Thank You for Being There
In My Darkest Times]

7
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,710
I think I've fallen for someone.

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,390
Thanks for being there for me, Sang Zhi.

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,110
- He's Duan Jiaxu.
- You're welcome.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,520
You helped me when I was little.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,280
I wasn't here for my online crush.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,030
Jiaxu,

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,960
I'll stay here with you.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,920
The doctor said
you need to lie flat for six hours

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
and can't eat anything all day.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
He's nice

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,310
and he treats me well.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,950
Actually, he treats everyone well.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,150
I fell for you

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,150
long before I came to Yihe for college.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,560
I lied to you.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
But I'll grow up.

23
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,480
I will.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,560
Jiaxu,

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
don't say things like that again.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,840
There's someone I really like,

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,230
but he doesn't like me back.

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,350
Duan Jiaxu,

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,870
you're a beast.

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,000
Duan Jiaxu, why did you drink?

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Zhizhi.

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,710
So...

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,750
did you drink to work up your courage?

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,000
Because of bad mood.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
Why?

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,800
I feel like I've treated you badly.

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,710
Why do you feel that way?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,750
Is it because of what I said?

39
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,000
I didn't mean

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,310
that you treated me badly.

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,750
I just wanted to tell you the truth.

42
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,120
You didn't know before,

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,360
and I was too young back then.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
You've always been good to me

45
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,400
all the time.

46
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,910
I really thought about it.

47
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,080
If it wasn't me,

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,680
would you meet someone better?

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,470
When the whole world is against us,

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,190
does it mean

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm not good enough for you?

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120

54
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,800
I love you.

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,710
I won't let you regret it.

56
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,080
Kid, time to go to bed,

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,430
okay?

58
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,750
Jiaxu,

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,150
I'm happy to see you again.

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
Me too.

61
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,680
I don't think I've ever told you

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
that I really like you.

63
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,750
Me too.

64
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,310
Did you sleep well?

65
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,560
Yeah, pretty well.

66
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,160
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,830
Because it's my first time too,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,680
so...

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Duan Jiaxu,

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,430
I'm hungry.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,430
Aw, you're blushing.

72
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm not.

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm just hungry.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,720
Alright.

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,480
You're not blushing

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,070
but hungry.

77
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,800
Right?

78
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,750
I will

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,310
keep working hard.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
On what?

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,070
On learning

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,870
new skills.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,830
Duan Jiaxu.

84
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,430
Oh my.

85
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,310
Wait a second.

86
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,630
Hello?

87
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,600
Got it.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
I'll head over now.

89
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,510
Thanks, doctor.

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
Who was it?

91
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,560
My dad's doctor.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
What happened?

93
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,190
My dad's condition isn't good

94
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,600
and they want to transfer him
to a municipal hospital.

95
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,430
I need to handle the paperwork.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,310
I'll go with you.

97
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,070
Okay.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,160
I probably shouldn't say this,

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,390
but you need to prepare yourself.

100
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,950
Your father has been bedridden
for 12 years.

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
His body's resistance is weakening,

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,510
and the long-term lung infection

103
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,390
has caused complications.

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,310
The situation isn't optimistic.

105
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,720
We don't have advanced rehab equipment.

106
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,430
It's better to transfer him.

107
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,800
Okay, I got it.

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,630
Come to my office later,

109
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
I'll process the paperwork.

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,430
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,680
Zhizhi,

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,430
can you buy me some water?

113
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,190
There's a small shop on the way here.

114
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,160
Alright.

115
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll be right back.

116
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Okay.

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Wait for me.

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Alright.

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,310
Duan Zhicheng,

120
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,560
did you hear what the doctor said?

121
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,000
His tone suggested...

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,310
it might be the end.

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
I don't know

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
whether it's the last time
I talk to you.

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
It's been 12 years.

126
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
If you hadn't jumped off the building,

127
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,960
you'd be out of jail, right?

128
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm not sure

129
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,880
whether Mom ever told you this.

130
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,470
After we sold the house

131
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,320
and paid the compensation,

132
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,720
nearly all the money we'd left
was spent on you.

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,590
Because of the debts,

134
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,350
none of our relatives would speak to us.

135
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,080
Eight years ago,

136
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,470
Mom was diagnosed with cancer.

137
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,880
She didn't tell me

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
because we had no money.

139
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,590
Until one day I took her for a checkup.

140
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,470
Do you know what the doctor said?

141
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,990
He said it was too late.

142
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,470
I didn't believe him,

143
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,880
so I took her to a bigger hospital

144
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,880
and borrowed 30,000 yuan
from a classmate.

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,590
When Mom found out, she broke down.

146
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,720
She kept crying,

147
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,350
begging me

148
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,720
to return the money immediately.

149
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,400
All because we had no money.

150
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,520
All because...

151
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,520
Probably because of you.

152
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,360
Tell me,

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,710
if you hadn't run from responsibility,

154
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,950
would things be different now?

155
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,550
If one day

156
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,000
you meet Mom,

157
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,760
please let her go.

158
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,000
