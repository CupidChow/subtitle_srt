00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,830
He's a ladies' man!

194
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,190
Womanizer, huh?

195
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,430
He makes you so sad.

196
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't love him anymore, okay?

197
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,360
Zhizhi.

198
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,400
Zhizhi?

199
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,160
Mr. Charming?

200
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,520
How about I become charming?

201
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,480
Then,

202
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,640
I will only care for you.

203
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
In this way,

204
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,830
you won't be so sad.

205
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,240
If you remain silent,

206
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,310
I'll take it as a yes.

207
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,950
Deal.

208
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,480
You approved.

209
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,760
I believe

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm good enough for you.

211
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm just a little bit older, though.

212
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
It's good if you can fall in love

213
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,240
with someone

214
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
who can take care of you.

215
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,160
But I'm afraid.

216
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,760
What if you get as sad as you are now?

217
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,240
When you're asleep,

218
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
you're still shedding tears.

219
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,670
In the future,

220
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,310
I'll try so hard to make money.

221
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,880
I'll buy you the world's best candy.

222
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,640
Okay?

223
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,360
Mm.

225
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,450
