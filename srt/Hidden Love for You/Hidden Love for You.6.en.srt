A girl is trying to pursue me.

193
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
I have no time for anybody else.

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,270
A girl is pursuing you?

195
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,750
Mm.

196
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,870
Duan Jiaxu will have

197
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,480
"happy" blind dates

198
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,360
with his boring pick-up lines.

199
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,630
Goodbye.

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,670
You're actually boring.

201
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,870
Who are you, thief?

202
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,840
Kid,

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
take it if you like it.

204
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,310
♪If we meet again, don't hug me♪

205
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,410
♪I don't want it this way♪

206
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,030
♪I can't see or force a smile♪

207
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,510
♪I'll just forget it♪

208
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,710
♪If I can't cover
the corners of my eyes♪

209
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,300
♪How will my tears roll down?♪

210
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:01,260
♪You actually know it's so hard for me♪
