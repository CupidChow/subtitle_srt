00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
or find another summer job.

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,830
It'll be easier to make money.

194
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,600
I was just giving you advice,

195
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,750
yet you brought up money.

196
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
That's pointless.

197
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,750
It hurts us both.

198
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,750
Your parents won't approve.

199
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
Do you really think he likes you?

200
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,630
Little girl,

201
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,360
let me tell you something.

202
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,830
He's never loved as a child.

203
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,040
You've been kind to him, right?

204
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,160
He falls in love

205
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,950
with anyone

206
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,160
who shows him

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,480
the slightest kindness.

208
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,600
If you break up with him,

209
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,960
what will he do?

210
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,480
He'll say "It's okay

211
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,440
as long as you find someone better."

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,270
Then,

213
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,440
he'll find hundreds to replace you.

214
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,670
You went to great lengths

215
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,840
just to tell me this?

216
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Interesting.

217
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,360
I hit a nerve, didn't I?

218
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
Sorry about that.

219
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,670
I just can't stand him.

220
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,480
Do you know why I'm so against him?

221
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,790
Because his father

222
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,550
kill mine in a crash.

223
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,150
I know.

224
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,030
He actually told you?

225
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,150
Seriously?

226
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,630
How shameless!

227
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,270
Ma'am,

228
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,790
collective punishment

229
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,360
was abolished centuries ago.

230
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
Then who should I blame?

231
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,150
If this happened to your family,

232
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,390
wouldn't you blame him like me?

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
His father committed a crime

234
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,360
and the court sentenced him.

235
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,750
- He'll...
- He'll be punished.

236
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,150
You know what?

237
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,840
My father could've been alive,

238
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
but that scoundrel Duan Zhicheng

239
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,440
fled the scene.

240
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,630
He was scared of prison,

241
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,390
so he jumped off the building.

242
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,750
Tell me,
what kind of punishment is that?

243
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,630
Tell me!

244
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,080
Isn't Duan Jiaxu a victim too?

245
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,600
Excuse me,

246
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,200
I need to leave.

247
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
Do you really think he likes you?

248
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,200
He's never loved as a child.

249
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,120
He falls in love

250
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,910
with anyone

251
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,120
who shows him

252
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,390
the slightest kindness.

253
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,240
He'll find hundreds to replace you.

254
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,510
But he's so nice to me.

255
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,320
Always accommodating me.

256
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,510
This is your first serious relationship.

257
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,390
I understand

258
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:31,910
your worries.

259
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,080
He'll support me.

260
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
Driving others home can be troublesome.

261
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,320
On everything.

262
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
But it isn't with you.

263
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,200
Come on.

264
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,030
He never forces

265
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,120
what I dislike.

266
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,630
If you don't want to go,
we'll eat something else.

267
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,670
Isn't that love?

268
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,440
I bought you honey.

269
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,150
Have some honey water.

270
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't get sick.

271
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,030
But our love

272
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,840
might not be equal.

273
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,390
Kid,

274
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,200
take it if you like it.

275
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,840
Won't you get bored?

276
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,630
Just having you here makes me happy.

277
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,150
Whether it's just a passing crush

278
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
or something more,

279
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,320
even the smallest bit of affection

280
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,790
from him

281
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,960
is enough for me.

282
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,840
