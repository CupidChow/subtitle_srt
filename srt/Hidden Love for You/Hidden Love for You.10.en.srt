Happy birthday to you.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,070
Happy birthday to you.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,350
Make a wish.

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,320
Mm.

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,560
A present for you.

12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,680
Thanks, Jiaxu.

13
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,950
Tell me something.

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,000
Huh?

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,120
The young man this afternoon...

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,350
Is he pursuing you?

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm afraid so.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,920
Do you have many pursuers?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,790
Not too many.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,310
What are the requirements?

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,790
There aren't any requirements.

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,950
I don't pick a boyfriend.

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,150
Then, tell me.

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,590
What kind of guy

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,710
will you like?

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,040
Handsome.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,790
Mm.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,350
Good-tempered.

29
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,840
Mm.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,040
He should be a head taller than me.

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,000
Mm.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,070
He needs correct values.

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,230
Anything else?

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,120
That's all I can think of now.

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,280
I think I'm qualified

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
for all that you just said.

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,590
May I ask you something?

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,750
What is it?

39

Jiaxu,

41
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,400
are you saying

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
what I think you are?

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Can you find another meaning

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
from what I just said?

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,840
But you said I was a kid.

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,280
That's just what I call you.

47
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,520
If you don't mind,

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,190
I can even call you kid when I'm 90.

49
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,030
You call me brother.

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,400
Do you see me as your real brother?

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,680
Yes, I do.

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,310
Fine.

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,710
Then, I'll pursue my "sister".

54
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,430
Okay?

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,430
It's not really that serious.

56
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,400
You should at least reply.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,190
Nobody asks for permission
before pursuing someone.

58
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,520
But if I didn't ask you,

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,080
you would still think

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,710
I cared for you as a brother.

61
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,680
That's up to you.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,560
Do what you like. I don't interfere.

63
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,430
What about you?

64

Do you have feelings for me?

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,630
No.

66
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,400
No?

67
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,750
But if you pursue me,

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,430
I may have feelings.

69
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,870
Then give me a spoiler alert.

70

How soon can I get you?

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,960
Why do you ask me that?

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,960
Sounds as if you'll definitely get me.

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,520

Then, I'll pursue you
for a few more years.

78
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,960
If you fall in love with someone else,

79
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll complain to your parents.

80
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,560
About what?

81
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,030
You asked me

82

83
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,150

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,750
and you accept me?

89
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,520
Jiaxu, don't be so narrow-minded.

90
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm not asking for too much.

91
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,590
Can't you just pursue me?

92
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,240
What?

93
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm saying...

94
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,840
Before you pursue me,

95
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,840
how will I know

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,310
if I have feelings for you?

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400

99
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,710

Sang Zhi, what are you
photographing so late?

105
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,270
It's her camera from Duan.

106

won't understand.

No.

109

110
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
he would pursue me.

111
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,600

Anyway, Sang,

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
how long will you keep him pursuing you?

118
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm not sure.

119
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,390
I think everything is perfect now.

120
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,600
No. I think Ning Wei has a point.

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
You should keep him pursuing you.

122
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,190
Well, change his alias into "pursuer"

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,720

124
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,800

No.

192
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,830
The night after tomorrow?

193
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,920
I'll have no classes then.

194
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
What a coincidence.
I'll be available, too.

195
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,720
But I have to do my homework.

196
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,480
I'll accompany you.

197
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Hey, Sang Zhi.

198
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,040
Huh?

199
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,160
Will you join us?

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,160
I'll have a try.

201
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,680
Then, the four of us
and Liang will team up.

202
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,040
Oh, Liang said

203
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,510
he was only available
the night after tomorrow.

204
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,870
You guys make time for it, then.

205
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,480
Ah?

206
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
What's wrong, Sang Zhi? You have plans?

207
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,120
No.

208
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,560
Let's make it the night after tomorrow.

209
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,270
Mm.

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,270
Let's eat.

211
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,750
I won't be available that night.

212
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,240
We'll have a group discussion.

213
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Zhizhi, you're really hard to get.

214
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,910
If you truly don't have time,

215
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,790
I'll go pick you up
during the lunch break.

216
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,120
We can have lunch together.

217
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,840
Mm, okay.

218
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Duan Jiaxu.

219
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,030
I'm out of money.

220
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,870
Give me some money.

221
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,190
♪If we meet again, don't hug me♪

222
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,290
♪I don't want it this way♪

223
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,910
♪I can't see or force a smile♪

224
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,390
♪I'll just forget it♪

225
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,590
♪If I can't cover
the corners of my eyes♪

226
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,180
♪How will my tears roll down?♪

227
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:48,140
♪You actually know it's so hard for me♪
