00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,310
why didn't you reply?

68
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,430
Because I was studying carefully.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,750
Are you sure?

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,240
Mm.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,910
Why do you study on the ground?

Every time you get close to me,

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,190
I feel a little bit nervous.

98
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
It's not that I'm upset

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560

101
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,600
That's not true.

106
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,800

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,430

108

It's over ten o'clock.

109
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,750

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,720

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,950
You keep them.

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,800
I took a pack of sugar.

114
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,310
Oh, you stole my sugar.

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,190
I didn't steal. Take it back.

Just kidding.

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm not that stingy.

118
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,040
Why do you hold my hand?

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
Sugar or hand. Give me one.

120
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,430
Jiaxu,

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,510
people hold hands naturally.

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,510
Only you ask before you do it.

123
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,120
I didn't ask last time I kissed you

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
and you were angry.

125
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,600
I wasn't angry.

126
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
I was just a little bit shy.

for applying for our internship.

138
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,000
Our company isn't very big.

139

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,800
Kid,

157
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,430
recently,

158
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,950
I've been busy in a relationship.

159
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,070
So,

160
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,390
I forgot you.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
When are you coming back?

162
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,310
I'm not going back.

163
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,240
You're not?

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,360
I told Dad and Mom.

165
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,430
They approved.

166
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,560
Say it again.

167
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,070
I'll get an internship

168
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,390
instead of doing anything evil.

169
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,950
You do as you like, then.

170
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,120
If you're deceived again,

171
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
don't cry to me.

172
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,510
I don't have time for you.

173
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,830
I wasn't deceived, okay?

174
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,920
You've had
a really long rebellious phase

175
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,510
even since junior high.

176
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,830
You're born mindless.

177
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,270
In love, you're brainless.

178
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,390
That's you.

179
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
You told everyone you had a girlfriend

180
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,920
and she pursued you.

181
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,680
Who'd believe that?

182
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,190
Want to pick a fight, huh?

183
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
You started this.

185
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,390
Do whatever you like.

186
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,360
I'm not that gullible.

187
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,430
How about I tell him the truth?

188
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,550
He trusts Duan Jiaxu, I believe.

189
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,320
If he knows it's Duan Jiaxu,

190
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
he won't be so angry.

Yan,

192
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,510
I'll just get an internship.

193
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,910
I'll go home
during the National Day holiday.

194
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,630
You know my boyfriend.

It's Jiaxu.
