You should be my servant all your life!

191
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,160
Did I say something wrong?

192
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,590
You deserve to die, don't you?

193
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,720
Very well.

194
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,550
Everybody thinks

195
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,400
a son should pay

196
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,350
for his father's sin.

197
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,760
Duan,

198
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,990
your father has been unwell lately.

199
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,520
He's in bed for ten years after all.

200
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,230
His body functions poorly and he's weak.

201
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,350
Now, he has serious pulmonary edema.

202
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,520
We suggest he should have an operation

203
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,350
to solve the problem.

204
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,160
Or a lung infection will be worse.

205
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,280
Dr. Cao,

206
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,720
do you think

207
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,790
he can still hold up?

208
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,990
Miracles happen when people are alive.

209
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll get to work.

210
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,360
Call me if you need anything.

211
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,030
Okay. Thanks, Dr. Cao.

212
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,950
You're welcome.

213
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,640
Miracle.

214
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,520
Liberation.

215
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,520
They are both

216
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,950
the most impractical words.

217
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,230
♪If we meet again, don't hug me♪

218
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,330
♪I don't want it this way♪

219
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,950
♪I can't see or force a smile♪

220
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,430
♪I'll just forget it♪

221
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,630
♪If I can't cover
the corners of my eyes♪

222
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,220
♪How will my tears roll down?♪

223
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,180
♪You actually know it's so hard for me♪
