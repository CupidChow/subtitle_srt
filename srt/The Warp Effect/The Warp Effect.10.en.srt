1
00:00:00,844 --> 00:00:01,844
Jedi.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,164
You gave me STDs?

3
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:05,767
These two have an HPV issue.

4
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:08,332
I never sleep with anyone,

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,700
but her.

6
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:10,908
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

7
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,912
Why do you want to be a father?

8
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,084
I just want to grab this chance.

9
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,532
Is it true?

10
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:21,072
Are you still in love with me?

11
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:24,844
I'm not ready.

12
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,348
I have no savings.

13
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,092
I want an abortion.

14
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:31,262
Sometimes by taking responsibility,

15
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,844
you just need to respect her decision.

16
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:36,972
So you actually know how to be nice.

17
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:39,196
Should have done it earlier.

18
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:48,828
Are you sure

19
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:50,988
that you know everything about me?

20
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:53,868
I still

21
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:56,812
have something up my sleeves that might surprise you.

22
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:00,622
I like surprises.

23
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:07,420
Then you'll love what I'm about to give you.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,068
What is it?

25
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:11,556
You get my hopes up, you know?

26
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:53,372
I told you, didn't I?

27
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:57,348
Nothing is scarier than a pissed-off woman.

28
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:11,651
Okay. Cut. That's a pass.

29
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:13,204
That's a wrap, everyone.

30
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,451
Thank you. Thank you.

31
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:17,388
Thanks.

32
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,756
Good job, everyone. Thank you.

33
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:21,732
Well done.

34
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,068
Mollie, thank you so much. That was a great performance.

35
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,900
Oh, thank you.

36
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:30,044
How was it, Jean?

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,724
Did you like it?

38
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:31,772
I loved it.

39
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,340
I was so moved.

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,860
I even felt sorry for you.

41
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,148
Thank you for putting a lot of effort into my film.

42
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:41,812
It's my pleasure.

43
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:45,540
When it comes to you, I'll put my effort into anything.

44
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:50,076
Keep flirting like that and I might start wavering.

45
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,124
Oh, is that so?

46
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:55,676
Does that mean what I've done up to now actually works?

47
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:00,060
Working on this set,

48
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:01,828
I get to work with a nice director,

49
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,820
I get to perform in a great movie,

50
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:08,548
and now I'll get a girlfriend?

51
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:14,492
What girlfriend?

52
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,132
Yeah.

53
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,372
I want to ask you out.

54
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:34,492
What do you say, Jean?

55
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:40,940
I feel like it's still too soon.

56
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,532
It's not.

57
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,820
You gotta be straightforward nowadays.

58
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,492
I don't want unfinished business.

59
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,652
When it comes to love,

60
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,412
I just want to clear it up as soon as possible.

61
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,482
So it won't get in the way of my life.

62
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,996
You don't have to give me an answer right now, Jean.

63
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,292
Tell me when you're ready.

64
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,548
I'll always wait for you.

65
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,156
Well...

66
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:10,780
Wanna dance with me?

67
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:13,572
Think of it as an extra scene.

68
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:17,436
Can I get some music, please?

69
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,948
Thitipoom Techa-apaikhun.

Jira Charoenthamasuk.

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,820
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri.

84
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:45,801
Oh, how is your film-

85
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:46,802
I said stop talking.

86
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:48,572
Just stand there and be quiet.

87
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,772
No more questions.

88
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:11,316
(You need to help me make up with Liu.)

89
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,422
(Or else you won't be able to go back and help Jean.)

90
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,044
(And no more coming for you!)

91
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,491
Look at the camera.

92
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,031
One, two-

93
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:34,364
Wait for me, you guys.

94
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:35,684
Alright.

95
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,380
Come on. Come closer.

96
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,956
Stay close. We work like a family here.

97
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:45,284
Alright.

98
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,076
Liu.

99
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:49,091
Tag me on Instagram.

100
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,741
And accept my follow request.

101
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:51,732
I want to tag you, too.

102
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:52,178
Okay?

103
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,179
Yes.

104
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,500
Do you think Mr. Wiroj's a bit weird?

105
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:03,244
You mean, about his handsy habit?

106
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:05,012
He does that to you, too?

107
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:07,500
So much that I got used to it.

108
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,491
He did that all the time when I first started working here.

109
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:12,548
He always touches and embraces like this.

110
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,932
It bothered me at first.

111
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:18,732
But really, he doesn't look like he means anything.

112
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,524
He's very generous.

113
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,436
I even got an extra bonus.

114
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:28,748
But is it really okay to let him touch you for some bonuses?

115
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,116
What's the harm in that?

116
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:31,625
Just let him do it.

117
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:32,972
It's for your career.

118
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,276
You think too much.

119
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:51,956
Where's everyone?

120
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,636
What happened?

121
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,460
Do they realise the match is approaching?

122
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:57,964
Why are you guys slacking off?

123
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:00,262
Don't you want to go to nationals?

124
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:03,252
Well, Chayen?

125
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,692
Where are your friends?

126
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:08,772
Well...

127
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,412
The players who aren't here today didn't come

128
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,371
because their parents don't want them to come here anymore.

129
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:14,372
Why not?

130
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:17,236
Well...

131
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,108
The parents...

132
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:21,514
They're talking...

133
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:22,515
Just spit it out.

134
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,140
They said you're gay, Coach.

135
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:28,872
So they don't want their sons to come here anymore.

136
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:32,941
Some parents reported

137
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:35,428
that they saw you displaying public indecency on the bleachers.

138
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:36,452
Public indecency?

139
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,732
You and your boyfriend were kissing on the bleachers.

140
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:41,124
They think it was inappropriate.

141
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:42,941
He's not my boyfriend.

142
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,531
And we were just messing around.

143
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:46,420
I don't know what he is or isn't to you.

144
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:50,091
But what the parents are concerned about is that

145
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,452
if their son's coach is a gay man,

146
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,588
their son could become gay, too.

147
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,540
Or worse,

148
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,412
the coach could do something to their children.

149
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:03,108
I get that you can identify as whatever gender you want,

150
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,905
but staying in this industry isn't easy.

151
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,692
If you want to keep being a coach,

152
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:13,164
you need to keep your sexual orientation a secret.

153
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:51,746
You got that?

154
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:52,747
Yes.

155
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,452
Next page.

156
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:58,508
Liu.

157
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:00,498
Oh?

158
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,499
Can I talk to you?

159
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:02,844
What are you doing here, Alex?

160
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,612
What? Who the hell are you?

161
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,284
How could you just barge into my office?

162
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:09,156
It's you I need to ask. What were you doing?

163
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,060
You touched Liu's shoulder with one hand,

164
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:12,531
and hold hers with the other?

165
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,548
How could you do that?

166
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,721
Touch?

167
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:15,908
We were just normally working.

168
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,244
Who do you think you are to lecture me?

169
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,836
Hold on, Alex. Let's go talk outside.

170
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:22,964
Is he your boyfriend, Liu?

171
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,324
It doesn't matter who I am.

172
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,068
You openly take advantage of her.

173
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,644
That's an accusation.

174
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,420
Security!

175
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,204
Enough.

176
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:34,140
Get out of here.

177
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,991
I'll call the police on you for trespassing.

178
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:36,882
You gonna call the cops?

179
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:37,676
Nice!

180
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:39,811
I'll report you for sexual harassment.

181
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:40,682
Alex, no.

182
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,282
I'll have you on video.

183
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:41,876
Listen up, everyone.

184
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:43,421
This guy harasses Liu.

185
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:45,082
He does that to all the ladies in his office.

186
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:45,436
Stop it!

187
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,092
Ew, you need to come here right now, man.

188
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:48,252
Alex!

189
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:49,523
Stop it! I'm not stopping!

190
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,731
Delete it! Alex, just go.

191
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,871
Liu, he harasses you.

192
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:52,698
Do you know who I am?

193
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,348
I'll get you!

194
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:53,996
Get him out of here.

195
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:56,011
I'll get you!

196
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:57,603
You are in so much trouble!

197
00:10:57,604 --> 00:10:58,708
I'll have you arrested!

198
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,702
See you in court!

199
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,188
What is all this about, Liu?

200
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,476
I...

201
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,940
(Ew, Liu was harassed by her boss.)

202
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,108
(Come to her office ASAP.)

203
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:29,420
(I already asked Nim for help!)

204
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,708
Liu...

205
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:35,492
I'll save you.

206
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:00,382
Hey!

207
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:01,468
Ew?

208
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
What?

209
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:04,172
Who are you people?

210
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,548
What are you doing in my office?

211
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:06,908
What's your problem?

212
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:08,711
I'm Liu's freaking boyfriend.

213
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:09,712
What?

214
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:10,708
What are you doing to me?

215
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,061
Did I ever do something to you?

216
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,380
It's not me you did something to.

217
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,491
It's my girl here.

218
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:16,924
She's here to work, not to be harassed by you!

219
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:18,131
Ew. Ew, don't.

220
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:19,292
Why the hell did you do that?

221
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:20,612
Ew, enough.

222
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:22,348
What are you doing?

223
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,602
How could you let him do that to you?

224
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Why didn't you tell me?

225
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:31,516
Just go.

226
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:33,228
Go away, both of you.

227
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:34,804
You think you're so pretty?

228
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,611
Who even harassed you?

229
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,866
I was just touching you because I needed to teach you your job.

230
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,348
It's just a display of friendship here.

231
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,588
How is that wrong?

232
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:44,948
And I'll tell you what, if we're really talking about it,

233
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:46,812
I'm sure your girlfriend likes it.

234
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,012
If she didn't, she would have told you a long time ago.

235
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,124
Right?

236
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:53,812
I don't like it.

237
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,468
I just had to put up with it for work.

238
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,372
But I'm not putting up with it anymore.

239
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,872
I don't want to work for an old pervert like you!

240
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:09,908
Let's go.

241
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:12,308
If he wants to call the police on us,

242
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,772
we'll sue him for sexual harassment.

243
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,172
No. No.

244
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:09,996
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,892
Being pregnant makes my hormones a raging mess.

246
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,836
I'm like... feeling it more than usual.

247
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:18,832
It's alright.

248
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:20,892
If the mother is happy,

249
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:22,436
the baby is happy.

250
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,372
I want to take care of both you and your baby.

251
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,322
I'll be here every day if I have to.

252
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:31,911
It's okay.

253
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,516
You should just go about your life.

254
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Hmm?

255
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,372
My life happens to include you.

256
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:53,588
Hey.

257
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:58,396
What exactly...

258
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:00,804
are we right now?

259
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,340
What?

260
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,868
Does this make you uncomfortable?

261
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,716
It's not like that.

262
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:14,262
It's just...

263
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,660
I don't want you to expect a lot from me.

264
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,516
I've decided I'll be a single mother.

265
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:26,812
So right now...

266
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:29,532
Are we...

267
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:32,004
friends?

268
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,308
Friends?

269
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:49,868
You gonna call me a friend after I made you come like that?

270
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,412
Is that what you call friends?

271
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:54,712
Well,

272
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:57,420
friends who help each other with sex.

273
00:15:58,302 --> 00:15:59,302
That's common, right?

274
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,236
What is wrong with you?

275
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:12,340
Lonely, are you?

276
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:17,108
You're pregnant and horny so you think you'd just ring up your ex for the service?

277
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:19,874
Do you think of me as your sex toy?

278
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,212
Hey.

279
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,332
Mollie.

280
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,092
It's nothing like that.

281
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:27,139
It's just that I've decided that I'll raise my baby alone.

282
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,131
I don't want to have someone right now.

283
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:31,324
I want to focus on the baby.

284
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:33,268
Hey, life's complicated, you know.

285
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,628
No, it isn't.

286
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,212
You're just being selfish.

287
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:44,876
Use a vibrator next time.

288
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,601
That stuff only needs a battery.

289
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:48,002
Mollie.

290
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,523
It doesn't have feelings you can hurt.

291
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,272
Mollie.

292
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:54,636
Can we just talk it out?

293
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:56,364
Mollie.

294
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:15,852
Hey.

295
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,204
It's no big deal.

296
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,932
It's just two guys kissing.

297
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,276
What's the problem?

298
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:25,284
Them dinosaurs...

299
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:26,988
Hey.

300
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:28,164
It just can't be, can it?

301
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,236
They're afraid I might turn their sons gay,

302
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:34,556
or, thinking like a real jerk, I might go for their sons.

303
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,636
They do sound like jerks.

304
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:38,044
Why don't you just quit?

305
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:42,004
I don't understand why you should care what anyone thinks

306
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,708
and not be happy with who you are.

307
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,092
It's not that easy.

308
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,764
You were a football player once, you know how it is.

309
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,492
You know how in the changing room,

310
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,371
the other guys cover their asses and crotches, wary of us,

311
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,068
thinking we're gonna look at them.

312
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,676
That's how they treated me in high school.

313
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,060
Don't you remember?

314
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,244
I do. All too well.

315
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,252
But listen, Joe.

316
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:03,636
We're adults now.

317
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:06,012
We don't have to care about them anymore.

318
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:09,204
You just need to stand up and fight for yourself.

319
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,044
You love being a coach, don't you?

320
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,212
You love teaching.

321
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,308
But right now, what you love

322
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:19,116
is about to stop you from actually living.

323
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,044
Don't be a coward.

324
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,042
Coward?

325
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:25,511
I'm a coward?

326
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,992
The coward is the guy who let me take all the blame and shame.

327
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:31,483
It's the guy who said I kissed him first, and then called me gay.

328
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,043
It's you who's a coward.

329
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,991
I apologised many times before.

330
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:36,156
Won't you just let it slide already?

331
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,628
I can't forget it.

332
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,916
You and I really are from two different worlds.

333
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:41,791
I'll tell you what.

334
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,844
Find someone who's ready to change themselves for you.

335
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:45,012
'Cause I'm not.

336
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,188
Just let me keep being boring.

337
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,421
Joe, Joe, Joe.

338
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,422
Slow down.

339
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,228
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:55,628
Listen to me.

341
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:57,522
I was too harsh.

342
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,348
You're not a coward.

343
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,140
I am.

344
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:01,828
And you're not boring.

345
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:02,836
Alright?

346
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:03,852
Let go of me.

347
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:05,012
I'm sorry!

348
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,012
Let go!

349
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:08,692
Enjoy your fun little life.

350
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,564
I'll deal with my own problem.

351
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Leave me alone.

352
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,914
Joe...

353
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:14,516
Leave me alone.

354
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,708
Joe!

355
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:01,980
Why did you never tell me

356
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:03,844
that your boss harassed you?

357
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:14,100
I don't know.

358
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,092
I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

359
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:23,124
I thought maybe I could deal with it myself.

360
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,804
I... didn't want you to worry about me.

361
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,996
I feel awful, you know?

362
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,476
All this time,

363
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:48,284
what kind of a boyfriend I must have been

364
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,484
if you never trusted me enough to tell me anything?

365
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,562
I only cared about me

366
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:13,532
that I didn't know you had to keep all these bad things to yourself.

367
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,372
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,084
Give me another chance.

369
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,732
From now on, I'll take care of you.

370
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,388
You don't have to look after me.

371
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:52,324
Whatever you want, I'll get it for you.

372
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:54,524
I'll serve you three square meals...

373
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:56,644
Whatever you need.

374
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,508
You don't have to do that much.

375
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:09,660
I actually just want to be cared for sometimes.

376
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:12,956
When I come home from a tiring day at work,

377
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:15,491
I just want some massages

378
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:17,972
or just someone who pampers me a bit.

379
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:23,188
Working is tough enough, you know.

380
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:31,116
I just want the kind of love that makes me feel at ease.

381
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:35,012
Of course.

382
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,020
I'll try.

383
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,708
I really can't live without you.

384
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:49,468
From now on, I promise

385
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,263
that you won't have to force yourself to do something for me anymore.

386
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:56,492
I'll do it for you.

387
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,596
That's unrealistic.

388
00:22:58,716 --> 00:22:59,114
It's not.

389
00:22:59,115 --> 00:22:59,978
Big talker.

390
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:00,682
I meant every word.

391
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:01,683
Big talker.

392
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,148
I meant it.

393
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:06,116
Can I get a hug?

394
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:12,036
Thank you, babe.

395
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:27,812
Won't you get in the water?

396
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:31,312
Or did you come here in that getup just to impress everybody?

397
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,302
I don't need to do that.

398
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:38,292
Someone just asked me out.

399
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Really?

400
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,121
What did you say?

401
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:43,122
Did you say yes?

402
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:46,956
Does that mean I have to hang out alone now?

403
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,756
All my friends are taken!

404
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:50,924
Slow down.

405
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:53,868
I haven't told him anything.

406
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,492
He's one of my choices and I'm still making up my mind.

407
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:02,412
Must be awful to be so pretty.

408
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:06,316
Does that mean... you have more than one option?

409
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:11,132
I was just kidding. There's only one.

410
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,252
Does...

411
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,162
Alex count as one of your choices?

412
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:32,332
It's actually none of my business.

413
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,572
But you know, don't you,

414
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,292
that he still likes you?

415
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,592
Do you still like him?

416
00:24:51,476 --> 00:24:53,252
Would anyone like someone like him?

417
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:58,884
Well...

418
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:01,392
I do.

419
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:03,404
I like Alex.

420
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,868
I asked him out, even.

421
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:10,402
But he turned me down.

422
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:14,164
Because he still likes you.

423
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:21,756
It's up to you.

424
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,660
It's just a choice, right?

425
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:27,004
It's your life. You make the call.

426
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:30,700
Just look for the answer within you.

427
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:34,484
Bye, then.

428
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:11,300
Are you alright?

429
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,612
I don't know if what I did was right.

430
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:23,692
Will my life be okay from now on?

431
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:29,164
I just feel so bad that I don't feel guilty at all.

432
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:32,860
And I feel bad for you, Ice.

433
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:34,491
You wanted a baby, didn't you?

434
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,492
No.

435
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:36,892
Kim.

436
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:38,702
This is your life.

437
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:39,924
I told you.

438
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,636
No matter what you decide,

439
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,632
I'm always on your side.

440
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:46,500
We're just not ready right now.

441
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:49,844
We can always have one when we are.

442
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:56,228
You like kids, right?

443
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,042
Hey.

444
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
One more thing.

445
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:10,796
We still have to follow our dream of becoming a musician couple.

446
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:14,132
What should we be like?

447
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:18,028
Someone like John Lennon and Yoko Ono?

448
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,828
Or maybe...

449
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:22,636
Johnny Cash and June Carter?

450
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,508
Oh, you know what?

451
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:26,991
I'll be Kurt Cobain.

452
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:28,764
You should be Courtney Love.

453
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:31,676
What do you say?

454
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,260
If you still talk nonsense like that,

455
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:37,148
it's a good thing we didn't have a baby.

456
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,068
You would have made our baby play music from the minute they're born.

457
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,796
Is that supposed to be bad?

458
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,331
If we have a kid, we can be a family band.

459
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,484
The Mama and Papa band.

460
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:51,916
But for now, let's stick with just us.

461
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:53,324
The Lover band.

462
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,828
You're insane.

463
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:58,364
Any request?

464
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:02,316
Write a new one.

465
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:03,948
Write a new one?

466
00:28:04,044 --> 00:28:05,076
Right now?

467
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,572
Since it's just us, write something for me.

468
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:43,004
I'm exhausted.

469
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:48,972
How was it?

470
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:50,628
How was your interview?

471
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,796
It was damn tiring.

472
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,372
You know how many places I've been to today?

473
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,660
There was this one office with a broken elevator.

474
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:59,652
I had to walk up to the 10th floor.

475
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,515
It was tiring.

476
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:03,512
My legs are killing me.

477
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:10,122
Do you want me to give you a massage?

478
00:29:11,072 --> 00:29:12,156
You know how to do that?

479
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:14,620
I don't mean to brag, but...

480
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,500
All the men in my family know how to give a proper massage.

481
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:21,300
Come here.

482
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Get up.

483
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:24,571
I'll give you a massage.

484
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:25,820
Come here.

485
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:31,516
Wait for me a bit.

486
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,484
I'll go get some water so I can wash your feet.

487
00:30:05,532 --> 00:30:08,556
Here I come, ma'am.

488
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:10,476
Here.

489
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:14,556
I will be your servant.

490
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:18,476
Put them here.

491
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:25,108
Soaking your feet in warm water after a long day is so damn nice.

492
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:36,102
I'll give you a massage.

493
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:37,596
Put your feet here.

494
00:30:57,764 --> 00:30:58,764
Babe.

495
00:30:58,932 --> 00:30:59,932
Liu.

496
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:01,492
Are you okay?

497
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,660
Keep going, baby.

498
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:39,652
Babe.

499
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:40,716
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,852
It's... I...

501
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:45,404
You did such a good job there.

502
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,756
I forgot myself.

503
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:50,836
Don't be sorry.

504
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:52,372
You don't need to apologise.

505
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:57,492
You never tell me this is how you like it.

506
00:31:58,636 --> 00:31:59,756
Oh, babe.

507
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,588
I get embarrassed saying that.

508
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:07,764
Who'd just blurt out that they feel good on their... feet?

509
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,116
You don't need to be embarrassed with me.

510
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:17,300
You need to tell me what you like, you know?

511
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:20,700
So we can help each other feel good.

512
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,956
If we're going to stay together for a long time,

513
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,876
it'll make us both happy.

514
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:28,076
Okay?

515
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:29,764
Yeah.

516
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:32,212
Well, then...

517
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,252
Here.

518
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,180
Are you sure about this?

519
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,708
Yeah.

520
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:44,356
Here.

521
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:45,924
I'll put it on for you.

522
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:52,116
Laika.

523
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:01,492
Good boy, Laika.

524
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,391
Hey, Army.

525
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:25,441
Slow down, man.

526
00:33:25,442 --> 00:33:27,251
Are you trying to get drunk so early in the night?

527
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:28,644
Why not?

528
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,668
I have a quota for the brokenhearted.

529
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,484
Someone like me really shouldn't have a boyfriend.

530
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,452
I should have just kept sleeping around.

531
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:41,142
You know why?

532
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,348
Because I am destined by this shitty world

533
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:45,532
to be public property.

534
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:48,281
I shouldn't belong to just somebody.

535
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:49,282
You know what I mean?

536
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,171
Enough, man.

537
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:52,028
You'll get wasted.

538
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,364
Slow down.

539
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:58,516
You called him a coward, of course he got mad for that.

540
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:00,060
Your mouth got ahead of you there-

541
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:01,580
You're such a pest.

542
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:03,396
You're my friend.

543
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:05,252
You should take my side.

544
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,428
You get it, right?

545
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,276
You should be scolding him, not me.

546
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,161
I am taking your side, man.

547
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:12,052
You've had enough.

548
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:12,620
Come here.

549
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:14,801
Easy there.

550
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,092
Why did Jedi call us all here anyway?

551
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:18,682
Did someone die?

552
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,516
I don't know, either.

553
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,116
Oh.

554
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:22,780
What?

555
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:23,788
Where's Liu?

556
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:27,796
Liu is back with her boyfriend. She's a goner.

557
00:34:27,924 --> 00:34:29,588
That's why I invited Jean here.

558
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
Everyone.

559
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:33,372
Everyone.

560
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:35,152
Listen up.

561
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:40,356
You guys must be wondering why I gathered you all here today,

562
00:34:41,352 --> 00:34:43,092
especially my friends from St. Jonathan's.

563
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:48,132
The reason I called you all here

564
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,972
is because I want you all to be the witness

565
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,740
of what I'm about to do.

566
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:58,108
I want to marry Rose.

567
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Rose.

568
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:14,036
We've been dating since high school.

569
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:17,202
We've been through so much together.

570
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,092
We make love.

571
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:20,148
We fight.

572
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,452
We nearly broke up.

573
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,388
But in the end, we belong together.

574
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:28,588
Being with you makes me so damn happy.

575
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:34,052
No other woman on earth makes me love the way you do.

576
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:41,516
Some people might think you only date me because I'm rich.

577
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:45,188
I'm not really rich.

578
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:47,498
Got loads of debts, actually.

579
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:48,499
Are you serious?

580
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,188
Kidding.

581
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,302
I want to spend the rest of my life just having fun with you.

582
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:03,244
Oh, Rose.

583
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:07,962
Marry me, Rose?

584
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:18,668
Congrats!

585
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,308
Look.

586
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:23,908
Miss Tranny's getting married.

587
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,901
Ain't she pretty?

588
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:27,731
But is she a woman down there?

589
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:28,732
Go ask them.

590
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:29,956
You ask, man.

591
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:31,692
What the hell are you saying?

592
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,516
What the fuck are you saying?

593
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:35,242
Jedi, calm down.

594
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:35,900
Calm down.

595
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:38,460
Sir, be respectful to my friend.

596
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,291
How is this not respectful?

597
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:43,420
We just want to know if she has her surgery yet.

598
00:36:43,596 --> 00:36:45,321
We said she's pretty, didn't we?

599
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:45,908
Right?

600
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:46,820
Yeah.

601
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,316
It's none of your business.

602
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:51,452
You don't have to say every stupid thing that comes to mind, you know?

603
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:53,882
Otherwise everyone would know how narrow your mind is.

604
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:54,883
Like, what's with you?

605
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:56,132
Are you gay?

606
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:58,500
Gotta protect your own kind or something?

607
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,132
Are you just looking for a fight

608
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:01,356
or trying to hit on one of us?

609
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:03,212
Stop.

610
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:05,291
Excuse me.

611
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,812
What her gender is or if she's been under the knife or not is none of your business.

612
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,092
Didn't you see that this is their moment?

613
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:13,021
If you're gonna be transphobic scumbags, get out of here.

614
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:13,908
Who are you? What do you have to do with this?

615
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:15,901
And who the hell are you? What the hell do you have to do with this?

616
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:19,671
Yeah, what do you have to do with this?

617
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,028
Get out of here.

618
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,363
Can you come meet me at my place?

619
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:55,362
I have something I need to talk to you about.

620
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh, the part you sent me was so good.

621
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,636
It's only because you did such a great job in that scene.

622
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,300
It's because you're such a good director.

623
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:07,092
Thank you.

624
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:10,028
Well...

625
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:11,956
Is there a reason

626
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:13,844
you called me here?

627
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:20,861
I... apologise I invited you over so late.

628
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:22,620
I need to talk to you about something.

629
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,492
What is it?

630
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:32,644
Do you remember that you asked me

631
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:35,051
if you could make a move on me,

632
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:37,348
that you asked me out?

633
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:40,752
Does that mean I'm getting an answer tonight?

634
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,748
Before I can give you an answer,

635
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:55,372
there's something I need to prove first.

636
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:57,982
What is it?

637
00:38:58,572 --> 00:38:59,924
I'm always ready.

638
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:20,828
Is that the answer?

639
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:58,082
Stop.

640
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,083
Stop it.

641
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,138
Stop.

642
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,139
Stop!

643
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:19,236
Jean, are you alright?

644
00:40:29,356 --> 00:40:30,788
I'm really sorry... about this.

645
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:34,684
I don't know what's wrong with me.

646
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:37,188
You don't need to rush it.

647
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,468
We don't have to sleep together.

648
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,676
I'm really sorry.

649
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:47,284
I want to be alone.

650
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,460
I still have something that...

651
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,364
that's stuck in my mind.

652
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:00,102
I still...

653
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,612
haven't moved on from it.

654
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:09,764
That's why my answer is.

655
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:15,548
I can't be anything more than this with you, Tony.

656
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:23,876
It's alright.

657
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,876
I understand.

658
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:29,364
I respect your decision.

659
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,156
Get well soon.

660
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,588
Excuse me.

661
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:20,312
We've played someone else's music.

662
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:22,708
I want you guys to hear my music, too.

663
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,956
I wrote this song for a woman

664
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:27,796
who's put up with me all this time.

665
00:42:27,988 --> 00:42:31,396
She's just made a big decision that needed a lot of courage.

666
00:42:32,512 --> 00:42:33,700
So I want to tell her that

667
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:35,148
no matter what happens,

668
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:37,516
I'll always be her strength.

669
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:39,812
You're doing amazing.

670
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:50,940
(I know you're going through something painful)

671
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:57,004
(And I know it's too heavy to bear, but do you know)

672
00:42:57,692 --> 00:43:03,148
(That we've been through so much together)

673
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:10,500
(And this time, we will do it again)

674
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:14,796
(Don't ever wonder if)

675
00:43:15,284 --> 00:43:18,996
(You've made a mistake)

676
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:22,531
(Because for what you're doing)

677
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:25,021
(You're amazing)

678
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:29,012
(Do you realise that)

679
00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:31,756
(What you're going through)

680
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:35,860
(Is hard to deal with)

681
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,811
(It's alright)

682
00:43:38,812 --> 00:43:42,316
(If you want to cry)

683
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:46,076
(You can cry to me)

684
00:43:47,732 --> 00:43:53,852
(These arms are always here to hold you)

685
00:43:56,402 --> 00:44:00,281
(I don't know how long it will take)

686
00:44:00,282 --> 00:44:02,724
(For you to be well again)

687
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:09,500
(Just know that from now on, I'll be here)

688
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:11,431
(Because the two of us)

689
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:15,211
(Still have to go through so much)

690
00:44:15,212 --> 00:44:22,652
(Good or bad, we will face it hand-in-hand)

691
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:26,916
(Don't ever wonder if)

692
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:31,204
(You've made a mistake)

693
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:34,468
(Because for what you're doing)

694
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:37,021
(You're amazing)

695
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:40,988
(Do you realise that)

696
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,724
(What you're going through)

697
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,780
(Is hard to deal with)

698
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,692
(It's alright)

699
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:54,388
(If you want to cry)

700
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:58,068
(You can cry to me)

701
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:05,780
(These arms are always here to hold you)

702
00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:13,148
(No matter what you have to face)

703
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:21,540
(Let me be your safe zone)

704
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,700
Are you sure you're living alone in this huge place?

705
00:45:29,908 --> 00:45:31,291
I have some spare room.

706
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:34,252
If you don't have anywhere to go, you're always welcome here.

707
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,484
I don't think I am. Not if there's someone else already living here.

708
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:39,076
You're babbling.

709
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:42,236
Let me know beforehand next time you want something from home.

710
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,140
I think you should probably throw out some of this old stuff.

711
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:46,732
Sorry.

712
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,516
I don't have time to go home and pack it.

713
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:50,932
Oh, are you alright now?

714
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,700
Is everything with Kim alright?

715
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:55,028
It's...

716
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:56,388
okay now.

717
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:57,723
We're working on some music.

718
00:45:57,724 --> 00:45:59,671
Kim is fleshing out the instrumental.

719
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:00,418
Look out for it, alright?

720
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:01,098
What?

721
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:01,932
Really?

722
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:02,492
Yeah.

723
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:03,492
You guys are amazing.

724
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,612
You know what, I'll play your music at the hospital.

725
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:07,772
Will they let you?

726
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,061
Of course.

727
00:46:09,062 --> 00:46:10,316
Whose brother do you think you are?

728
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:11,452
It's okay, you know.

729
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:14,972
Don't worry. I'll do it.

730
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:17,442
You don't have to.

731
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:27,572
It's Mum's photos.

732
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:29,472
Who is she with?

733
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,860
I don't know.

734
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,220
Ice...

735
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:40,836
Isn't this Mr. Saran?

736
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:46,668
Why is there a photo of Mum and Mr. Saran?

737
00:46:56,548 --> 00:47:01,500
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri.

738
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:03,872
What are you hiding from me, Dad?

739
00:47:05,112 --> 00:47:06,432
I want to talk to you about this.

740
00:47:10,604 --> 00:47:12,404
If you can kick the ball to hit the crossbar,

741
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:14,171
I'll go to prom with you.

742
00:47:14,172 --> 00:47:15,316
You want to be alone.

743
00:47:15,564 --> 00:47:16,924
You want to raise your baby alone.

744
00:47:17,942 --> 00:47:19,182
Who is even trying to stop you?

745
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,300
If you get her to kiss you,

746
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:25,164
the curse will go away.
