1
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:07,264
Do you promise to be a good boy tonight?

2
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:11,954
Hey.

3
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:16,544
Answer my question.

4
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,723
I–I will be very good.

5
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,674
Oh, dear.

6
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:23,984
Little boy.

7
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:27,504
You're not very adept at this.

8
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:28,774
Come, come.

9
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:32,264
I'll teach you a steamy lesson.

10
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,264
I promise to hold nothing back.

11
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:39,144
Gotta live up to the name Meow, Star of the Parlour.

12
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:54,834
Me–Meow.

13
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,584
I'm giving you this ring as a reminder

14
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:08,584
that you will wait for the right time.

15
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,283
You will keep your virginity

16
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:15,144
and wait for the right person at the right time.

17
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:21,984
And if I don't do exactly that?

18
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:25,983
You will never go to Heaven.

19
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:28,464
Every time you sleep with someone,

20
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:31,224
there will be calamity.

21
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:35,064
Wait, Meow. Wait.

22
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:38,424
What?

23
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:41,944
I... I think I can't.

24
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,154
Can't what?

25
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:47,514
You looked like you were having a good time just now.

26
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:50,544
Wait, wait, wait.

27
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:52,833
Let's stop here.

28
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,624
If we go any further,

29
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:57,264
something terrible will certainly happen.

30
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:01,553
You're a tease, you know that?

31
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,704
What exactly do you want?

32
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,023
Let's stop.

33
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,584
I'll still pay you the full price.

34
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:09,584
Full price, huh?

35
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,344
If you're going to pay the full price,

36
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,343
then I'm giving you the full service.

37
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,344
I have a reputation to maintain, you know.

38
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:30,744
I told you something terrible will happen!

39
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,304
Help!

40
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:42,984
Help!

41
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:44,784
Run, run, run!

42
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,624
Which way do I go?

43
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,034
Help!

44
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:03,414
Wait for me!

45
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,373
Sneaked out, didn't you?

46
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,834
I'll give you a ride home.

47
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,824
You don't need to drop me off in front of my house.

48
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:17,824
Don't want my family to find out.

49
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:20,424
Sure thing, kid.

50
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:33,264
Thitipoom Techa-apaikhun.

51
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:35,384

Jira Charoenthamasuk.

64
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,894
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri.

65
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:09,264
Pops, you scared the hell out of me.

66
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:11,343
Where'd you get that bra, anyway?

67
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,943
I think it's my cue to ask where you went last night.

68
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:17,653
What's this underthing doing in front of your door, kiddo?

69
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:20,583
Did someone leave this with you as a memento?

70
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,094
Where were you last night?

71
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,424
Pops.

72
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,544
Listen, Pops.

73
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,304
Don't tell Dad about this.

74
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,774
If he finds out, he's gonna give me an earful.

75
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:31,973
Come on.

76
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:33,514
I won't tell anyone.

77
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:36,504
This will be our little secret.

78
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,204
Ice.

79
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,828
Do you actually get anything in your head

80
00:05:57,852 --> 00:05:59,407
listening to music while studying?

81
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,544
What?

82
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,572
I asked if you actually understand anything

83
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,048
with rock music blasting like that.

84
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,223
Of course I do.

85
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,383
It's called multitasking.

86
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,243
Doing several things at the same time, you know.

87
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,673
It's what smart people do.

88
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,473
Unlike someone like you who can only do one thing at a time.

89
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,584
You're a loser at school and you're dumb.

90
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:17,423
I drew the short straw to have a big brother like you.

91
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:18,344
You insulting me?

92
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,344
No. Not at all.

93
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,984
Surely you misunderstood.

94
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:21,954
Bastard.

95
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:22,794
I really didn't.

96
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:23,654
You freaking did.

97
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,503
I did not. You misunderstood.

98
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,144
You think you're smart, huh-

99
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,104
Stop it, both of you. Just talk like normal brothers.

100
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:32,413
- Dad, Ice called me a loser. - I literally didn't. You misunderstood.

101
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:33,483
- Misunderstood, my ass. You called me dumb. - I didn't.

102
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:34,903
Alex. Ice.

103
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:37,434
Ice, I know you're smart, no need to brag about it.

104
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:40,233
Alex, you don't need to take offence

105
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,344
if you're not what he says you are.

106
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,704
Don't take offence if you're not dumb, 'kay?

107
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,704
If you're so smart, just quit school.

108
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,573
Enough. Just eat your breakfast.

109
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:54,424
Dad, breakfast's ready!

110
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,963
Ride safe.

111
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:05,293
Come home early for once.

112
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,974
You came home late last night, didn't you?

113
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:08,234
Sure, Dad.

114
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:12,223
You're a grown man who don't need no ride to school now, huh?

115
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,673
You're riding a Vespa and all.

116
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:14,334
How cool.

117
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:15,634
None of your business.

118
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,624
Just leave your brother alone, Ice.

119
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:19,303
Don't you have an exam today?

120
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,524
You sure you're ready?

121
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,574
What? Is it broken?

122
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:29,934
It's not, dumb-ass.

123
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,183
Hey!

124
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:13,854
How was it?

125
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:17,193
Did you lose your virginity to my beloved Meow?

126
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:18,674
Lose my virginity?

127
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,133
I lost my face, if anything.

128
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,583
I told you it wouldn't work.

129
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,453
My mother's curse is even stronger than

130
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:28,143
that goddamn lightning scar on Harry Potter's forehead.

131
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:29,163
Nonsense.

132
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,333
What the hell, man?

133
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,613
There is no such thing as a curse.

134
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,663
You're just a wimp.

135
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,543
Everybody our age has done it.

136
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:36,583
But look at you.

137
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,674
You're Mr. Virgin.

138
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:41,234
You're Mr. I'll-Keep-My-Virginity-For-The-Right-Time.

139
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,333
You know what the right time is?

140
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:44,664
Now!

141
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:47,134
There is no time more right than this, man.

142
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:49,643
We're in the prime of our youth.

143
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,664
Our hormones are raging.

144
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:57,664
They're ready to erupt like lava from the mouth of a volcano...

145
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,664
Boom!

146
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,383
This is See-ew, my best friend.

147
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,663
He's the guy who sent me to Meow.

148
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,233
His family owns a photography studio.

149
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,713
He's an astronomy geek.

150
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:12,943
He's also an expert on all categories of porn.

151
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:16,254
He's watched every single genre you can think of.

152
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,644
Sorry. Didn't see you there.

153
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,784
I thought the back of your head was a wall.

154
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,353
The football field is out back. Go play over there, idiots.

155
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:25,464
We're athletes.

156
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,544
We have to constantly practise.

157
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:31,874
Losers like you lot wouldn't have any idea what it's like

158
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:33,584
to be at the top.

159
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:41,544
My bad.

160
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:44,744
Found that ball lying around.

161
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:46,693
Just wanted to return it to you

162
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:47,805
in hopes that it would hit your head

163
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,543
hard enough your brain started working.

164
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,424
Maybe you'll even realise bullying is wrong.

165
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:52,694
What?

166
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,014
You think you can do whatever you want

167
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,679
just because you're on the football team?

168
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,424
Wanna have a go with a boxer?

169
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,564
Do ya?

170
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:00,154
Do ya?

171
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:01,424
Come on.

172
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:02,574
Do ya?

173
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:03,574
You don't?

174
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,664
Let's go.

175
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:10,803
Act tough, huh.

176
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:12,423
Keep up the act, losers.

177
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,583
You idiot, why didn't you punch him in the face?

178
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:15,594
Oh, come on now.

179
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:19,743
I am not the heiress of some boxing gym like you, you know.

180
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,224
Wimp.

181
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:23,864
What about you?

182
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:27,036
I saw it on the news that that massage parlour burned down.

183
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:29,074
It was hilarious.

184
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:34,024
(NIGHTLIFE ENJOYERS FLEE AS MASSAGE PARLOUR BURNS DOWN)

185
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,036
Your face was just too damn funny.

186
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,463
This is Nim, my other best friend.

187
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,112
She's set to inherit her father's boxing gym.

188
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,647
She may be small, but she's got a mean punch.

189
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,261
She's also the only one of us with a girlfriend,

190
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:48,266
and that's none other than Molly,

191
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,521
an upperclassman who already graduated.

192
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:52,617
She made the first move by giving her a sticker on Valentine's Day.

193
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,122
They're majorly lovey-dovey.

194
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:58,156
They're also majorly fighting over the silliest stuff.

195
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,154
So you admit it now?

196
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,154
Admit it, my ass!

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,954
You really are a wimp, man!

198
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,953
Is it okay if I kiss you?

199
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:13,126
Of course.

200
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:14,953
But is that really all you want?

201
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,953
You don't want to do more?

202
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,954
I do, but... let's start with a kiss.

203
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,648
Cut!

204
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,901
Good job!

205
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,993
Give them a round of applause.

206
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,098
That was well done.

207
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:34,408
The acting was nice, too.

208
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,557
We are learning about consent today.

209
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:40,393
In other words, it's an agreement to a sexual intercourse.

210
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:42,394
Sex is an activity you do together.

211
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:45,396
So both parties have to consent to it.

212
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,931
You can't force it out of them.

213
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:47,932
Get it?

214
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:49,211
Yes.

215
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:50,558
Okay, then.

216
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,556
Let's see who our next roleplay partners are.

217
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,474
Alright, alright. I've got one.

218
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:06,503
And the first actor is A...

219
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,335
A...

220
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,673
A... lex!

221
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,833
Come on up.

222
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,033
Alright, our next actor is...

223
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:30,286
This is Kat, the girl who makes coming to school actually worth something.

224
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:33,433
It is safe to say that she's the girl of my dream.

225
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,888
Every time she and her friends walk by,

226
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:39,146
I see the world in slow motion,

227
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:41,433
with sexy music playing in the background.

228
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:45,753
She could get anyone in this school.

229
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:48,393
But she chose this bastard, Army.

230
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,981
And the other actor is...

231
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,474
- It's... - Could be you.

232
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,852
Army!

233
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:07,063
Sir, can you draw again?

234
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,064
Why?

235
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,713
I just feel like it's not gonna work between two guys.

236
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:15,162
You have to learn about this no matter what your sexual orientation is.

237
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,874
Just come here before we run out of time.

238
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,511
Or what? You have a problem with something here?

239
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,568
I guess not. Come here.

240
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,274
Come here, kid.

241
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,141
Give them a little encouragement.

242
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,341
Sir.

243
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,440
But who tops and who bottoms?

244
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:35,626
That's none of your business.

245
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:38,833
Don't go around asking people that. It's rude, you know.

246
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:40,833
Yeah, that's right.

247
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,833
Repent, you fool.

248
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,233
If you're ready, let's begin!

249
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,513
Let's just get this over with quickly.

250
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:51,514
I know.

251
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:57,931
Well...

252
00:13:58,406 --> 00:14:00,040
You look nice tonight.

253
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,313
Nice, my ass.

254
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,941
Do you need to say something so creepy?

255
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,573
It gives me goosebumps.

256
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:07,753
I thought you wanted this to be over quickly.

257
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,891
I'm just trying to set the mood.

258
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,051
Fine.

259
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,754
You don't look too bad yourself.

260
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,794
Can I... hold your hand?

261
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:26,935
No way.

262
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:28,713
You're losing Army to someone else.

263
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,439
Your hand is so soft.

264
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,034
Your arm is so muscular.

265
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:39,433
Do you work out?

266
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,473
I'm a school athlete.

267
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,473
No wonder you're so fit.

268
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,473
By the way,

269
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,640
your eyes are so pretty.

270
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,793
Has anyone ever told you that?

271
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,771
No.

272
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,673
Are you saying no one ever notices?

273
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,876
Army.

274
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:11,033
Can I kiss you?

275
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:15,151
If you don't want me to,

276
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:17,914
I won't make you.

277
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:32,803
Cut!

278
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:33,828
Shit!

279
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:39,800
- Why the hell did you do that? - Why the hell did you kiss me?

280
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:40,975
We were roleplaying!

281
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:42,993
Look, kids.

282
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:46,610
In the case that the other party does not consent,

283
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:47,786
you need to stop what you're aiming for.

284
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,993
Or else there could be consequences.

285
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,738
That's it for today.

286
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,387
Let's end this class here.

287
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,171
We'll see each other in the next class. Alright?

288
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,414
Dismissed. You're all dismissed.

289
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:06,548
Goodbye.

290
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:07,252
Goodbye.

291
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:07,954
Thank you.

292
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,954
Goodbye.

293
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,553
- Bye. - Goodbye.

294
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,590
Wait.

295
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:19,384
Do you need to go to the infirmary?

296
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:20,433
I'm fine.

297
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:26,433
I saw that video of you at the massage parlour.

298
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,433
What?

299
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,050
Don't be shy.

300
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,051
It's only natural.

301
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,954
But...

302
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:35,234
Be careful and use protection, alright?

303
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:37,234
Don't knock anyone up.

304
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:40,871
More importantly, it's for your own good against STDs.

305
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:42,954
So use protection, alright?

306
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:45,841
Listen.

307
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:47,313
If there's ever a problem,

308
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,474
you can always talk to me.

309
00:16:57,494 --> 00:17:00,436
Lex, I heard you kissed Army in Sex Ed?

310
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:01,568
I didn't know you swing that way, too.

311
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:02,673
I don't.

312
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:04,328
It was just an exercise.

313
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,239
I was just very good at roleplaying.

314
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,674
Army just hit me out of the blue.

315
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,113
I bet he's into you.

316
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,273
You ever heard how boys bully you because they like you?

317
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,273
You've got a point.

318
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:13,929
Right?

319
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,149
I never heard of such a thing.

320
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:16,956
Why did it have to be Army anyway?

321
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,099
Why couldn't it be Kat?

322
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,685
You aim too high, idiot.

323
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,314
She's out of your league.

324
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,314
Be realistic.

325
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:24,437
You dog.

326
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,529
Free tampons!

327
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,273
Free tampons!

328
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,273
Free tampons!

329
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:34,913
Listen up.

330
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:41,417
Every 21-35 days, a woman loses 30-100cc of blood in up to eight days.

331
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,565
Imagine being a woman and burdened by such unavoidable expenses.

332
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,488
Yet, essentials such as tampons are not provided

333
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:49,423
even when it's necessary for women's life.

334
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:50,328
This is Jean.

335
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:51,614
You've probably seen her around before.

336
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,118
She's my classmate.

337
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,941
She's also the president of the Short Film Club.

338
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:59,353
And you're also looking at our school's top activist.

339
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:00,494
Jean will rally for anything she believes

340
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,257
everyone has a right to receive.

341
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:03,473
Free tampons!

342
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,122
Free tampons!

343
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,513
Free tampons!

344
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,393
Boys can sign up, too.

345
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,401
Alex, we have an appointment today.

346
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,953
The teachers want us to take some photos for the yearbook.

347
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,402
Okay. I'll see you after class.

348
00:18:16,403 --> 00:18:17,453
Okay.

349
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,871
Can you pass this around?

350
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,433
Thanks.

351
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:22,774
Bye.

352
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:28,448
Since when did you get so chummy with Jean?

353
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:29,449
You hooking up?

354
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:31,354
No, we're not.

355
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,125
We're just in the same club.

356
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:33,763
What?

357
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,063
Just 'cause I'm talking to someone of the opposite sex

358
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,033
doesn't mean I'm hooking up with them.

359
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:41,313
You do know women and men can be friends without sex involved, right?

360
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:43,083
I didn't say anything.

361
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,027
You're overreacting.

362
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:45,027
I'm not.

363
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:46,834
- You totally are. - You guys. Listen up!

364
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:50,031
I'm holding a party tonight at my place.

365
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,535
Both my parents won't be home.

366
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,031
So everyone's welcomed to join.

367
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:58,031
More importantly, there are no rules at my house.

368
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:00,031
Do whatever you want.

369
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,033
If you wanna join, we'll start at 7.

370
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:04,966
See y'all there!

371
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:07,987
It's a party.

372
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:08,984
Shall we go?

373
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:10,873
I'm sure a lot of girls will be there.

374
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:14,072
Of course we're going!

375
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,719
I'm taking Molly with me.

376
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,719
She's been sulking a lot lately.

377
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,183
It's probably because you ain't meeting her needs.

378
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,184
Asshole.

379
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,535
Lex.

380
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:25,953
I think there's a chance you'll lose your virginity tonight.

381
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,488
And you'll turn 18 at midnight anyway.

382
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,953
When your mother said "the right time,"

383
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,851
maybe this is exactly what she meant.

384
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:40,473
And that right person could be waiting for you at the party.

385
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:49,579
Hey.

386
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:50,738
Jean.

387
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:54,031
I've got all the footage of the school we need.

388
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,385
Thanks.

389
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,946
I didn't know you owned a film camera.

390
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:02,273
I like film photography.

391
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,273
I really like that I have to wait and see how it'll turn out.

392
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,053
It makes me more deliberate, too.

393
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:11,490
Before you press the shutter,

394
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:13,551
you need to be thorough.

395
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,387
If you ruin that photo then it can't be undone.

396
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,551
It's unfixable.

397
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,640
So every shot really means something.

398
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,020
I think I prefer digital cameras.

399
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,335
If I make a mistake with one photo,

400
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:27,831
I can just shoot another one until I'm happy with it.

401
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,036
What?

402
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,190
Do you make a lot of mistakes?

403
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:34,593
What... exactly do you mean?

404
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:37,247
With photography, of course.

405
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,832
What were you thinking about?

406
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,833
Nothing.

407
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,832
Do you want to try other locations?

408
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,393
I'll go with you.

409
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:47,265
Alright.

410
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,473
Here.

411
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,473
Let me put this on for you.

412
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:01,919
Oh?

413
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Alright?

414
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:17,314
There you go.

415
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:16,073
Do you know what the theme for the yearbook is this year?

416
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,117
What is it?

417
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,881
It's memories.

418
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,513
Memories?

419
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:26,392
The teachers want us to capture the good moments we have at school.

420
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:29,393
It could be the locations, the people, or whatever.

421
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,494
What about you?

422
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,793
Do you have any good memories here?

423
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,289
Me?

424
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:39,673
Besides being friends with Nim and See-ew,

425
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:43,461
I can't think of anything else.

426
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,913
Well, I'm just some guy with no talents.

427
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:49,353
I feel like I'm only coming to school just because I have to.

428
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:51,993
You don't have any life goals?

429
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:55,993
Actually, I kind of do.

430
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:57,993
My dad wants me to be a doctor.

431
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:02,310
But I just can't picture myself being that.

432
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:08,233
I actually want to be a photographer or a cameraman on film sets.

433
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,793
But I feel like I'm not good enough for that.

434
00:23:13,154 --> 00:23:15,793
But you can always get better at it.

435
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:19,319
I really believe you will be great at what you do,

436
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
and you will work for me, too.

437
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,793
Because I want to be a film director.

438
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:25,873
Really?

439
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:29,233
I'm sure you will.

440
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:33,814
You're already in the Short Film Club and help out with school videos.

441
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:38,393
I bet one day you will become one of Thailand's top directors.

442
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,258
Anyways.

443
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,113
Can I ask you something?

444
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:47,950
I've seen you wear that ring all this time.

445
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:49,113
Can I take a look?

446
00:23:58,185 --> 00:23:59,194
"I will wait."

447
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:01,571
Wait for what?

448
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:04,351
Well, it's...

449
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:07,353
This ring...

450
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,474
It's a promise to my mother.

451
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:11,994
What promise?

452
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,351
Just a promise. Nothing major.

453
00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:18,353
Tell me.

454
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:19,753
What did you promise her?

455
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:20,355
No.

456
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,028
-You don't need to know that. It's nothing. -What did you promise her?

457
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,119
- It's really nothing. - Now I'm really curious, you know.

458
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,165
Nope.

459
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,953
Tell me or I'm pushing you off.

460
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:27,652
Come on now.

461
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:28,347
Five...

462
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,347
Hold on.

463
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:32,153
Well, it's...

464
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,154
I promised my mother that.

465
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:40,033
I won't have sex until it's the right time.

466
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:45,875
That's it.

467
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:48,290
Don't be shy.

468
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,233
You can talk to me about this.

469
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,233
I think it's pretty cool.

470
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:54,233
But...

471
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,739
I can't talk to you.

472
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:57,481
You're a girl.

473
00:24:57,482 --> 00:24:59,230
Girls talk about sex, too.

474
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,633
It's natural.

475
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,113
And there's nothing embarrassing about being a virgin.

476
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:05,553
I haven't slept with anyone, either.

477
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:07,402
Really?

478
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:08,553
Really.

479
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,233
And I am not waiting for "the right guy" or anything.

480
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,233
I just haven't found someone I want to share that moment with.

481
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:20,673
I think I'll find him when the time comes.

482
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:22,673
So I'm in no rush to find someone.

483
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,233
Let me see.

484
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,984
(You here yet? People are arriving.)

485
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:50,833
No phones on the dining table, remember?

486
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:53,793
Or is there some urgent matter at hand?

487
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:55,793
I bet he just wants to go to the party, Dad.

488
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,839
He doesn't want to have dinner with us.

489
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,719
What party?

490
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:00,896
It's-

491
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:02,231
It's the senior party.

492
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:04,833
I think they're going all out this time, too.

493
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,380
You already went out last night.

494
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,735
I know you're turning 18.

495
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,033
Can't you wait for another day?

496
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,541
Once you're 18, I'll let you go.

497
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:16,797
Yes.

498
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,342
Shut your trap, Ice.

499
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:29,105
Hello?

500
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,339
Now?

501
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:35,273
But she isn't due.

502
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,273
Alright. I'll be there.

503
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,153
There's an emergency C-section at the hospital.

504
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:45,153
I have to get to work.

505
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:47,194
Stay at home with your grandpa and your brother.

506
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,482
Yes.

507
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:09,112
Pops, lemme help.

508
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:10,383
Don't.

509
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:12,112
This is like my workout session.

510
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,394
Just go. Go to that party.

511
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,169
Can I really go?

512
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:18,152
Who will look after you and Ice?

513
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:20,038
Do I look like I need looking after?

514
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,152
And Ice will be studying anyway.

515
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:23,633
Don't listen to your father too much.

516
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:24,634
Go.

517
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:28,480
- You sure? - Just go enjoy your youth.

518
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,694
I'm going to take a shower, then.

519
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:30,763
Wait, wait.

520
00:27:30,764 --> 00:27:32,953
There's something for you.

521
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,593
I found it outside.

522
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,539
It's got your name on it.

523
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:41,642
Who is it from?

524
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:43,476
I don't know.

525
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:45,713
Could be one of your secret admirers?

526
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,633
I doubt it.

527
00:27:49,096 --> 00:27:50,930
It's not even my birthday yet.

528
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:52,211
Who the hell could this be from?

529
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,033
I bet it's just a prank someone is pulling on me.

530
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:59,193
Let me see.

531
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,313
An instant camera?

532
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:09,853
That's vintage.

533
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,782
It's a Polaroid.

534
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:11,978
This is an old model.

535
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:13,114
Is it still working?

536
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:14,932
I don't know.

537
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:15,827
Should we try?

538
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,113
Sure.

539
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,513
One, two, three.

540
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:35,034
Pops, why isn't the photo developed?

541
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,341
Look.

542
00:28:38,408 --> 00:28:40,113
It may take longer than usual.

543
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,239
It will show up.

544
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:45,673
I'll take this to the party, then.

545
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:46,896
Sure.

546
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,193
I'm going to take a shower now.

547
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,193
And Pops...

548
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:52,239
Don't tell Dad.

549
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:54,753
I won't.

550
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:56,666
Just be careful.

551
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,433
Enjoy yourself.

552
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:01,273
You don't know what will happen tomorrow.

553
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:04,273
You only have one shot at life.

554
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:06,944
Alright?

555
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:08,193
Alright.

556
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:15,113
I'm really off to the shower now.

557
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:28,153
Welcome to the party!

558
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:38,393
Everyone's really already drunk.

559
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:39,561
That's because you're late.

560
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:40,715
Listen up!

561
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:42,716
This is my girl.

562
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,359
I just want to say that I love her more than anything in the world!

563
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:49,081
Enough, enough.

564
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,031
Stop it right there.

565
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:51,713
You're embarrassing.

566
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,713
But I love you.

567
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:57,437
I just want everyone to know that I'm all yours!

568
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:07,631
Oh, hey...

569
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:10,753
Did you send me this instant camera as a gift?

570
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:12,131
Send you a gift?

571
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:13,753
I already gave you your present.

572
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,595
Meow, that is.

573
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:16,741
Oh, right.

574
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,193
Then who the hell sent me this?

575
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:19,972
Never mind that.

576
00:30:19,972 --> 00:30:20,928
You have it now.

577
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:22,742
Just take a shot of me.

578
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:24,193
Here.

579
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:25,471
I look real cool right now.

580
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,034
Move this way a little.

581
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:32,848
Now that's it.

582
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:33,849
Really?

583
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:35,236
One, two, three.

584
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,113
Let me see.

585
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:42,035
It's not developed yet.

586
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,036
Wait a sec.

587
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,353
Lex.

588
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:49,256
I'll be right back.

589
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:51,633
You can go find Nim. She's inside.

590
00:30:52,465 --> 00:30:53,369
Good luck, buddy.

591
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:53,784
Ew?

592
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:54,784
Ew!

593
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,553
You're leaving me so soon?

594
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:08,153
What the hell was that?

595
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:14,081
I can't wait to graduate high school

596
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,793
so I can go to the same uni with you.

597
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:18,793
Really? You're aiming for the same uni?

598
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:20,793
You don't have to, you know.

599
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:21,941
What?

600
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:22,971
Are you being possessive?

601
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:25,178
Of course I am.

602
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,263
My girlfriend's dang pretty, after all.

603
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:27,742
So how is it?

604
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:35,233
Anyone on campus hitting on you?

605
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:36,453
Well...

606
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:37,454
Actually yes.

607
00:31:38,888 --> 00:31:40,433
Some guys.

608
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:41,501
Really?

609
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:42,619
Guys?

610
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:44,507
It's fine by me.

611
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:46,514
I know you like girls.

612
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,939
Says who?

613
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,033
People change, you know.

614
00:31:52,504 --> 00:31:59,033
I do feel kind of swayed when I meet some tall, pretty guys.

615
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:01,292
Just my type.

616
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:03,846
Are you being serious right now?

617
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,033
Should I be jealous?

618
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:11,453
I'm kidding.

619
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:13,033
I was just babbling.

620
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:14,221
Right now,

621
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,938
there's only you.

622
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:17,036
Happy now?

623
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,202
Alex, you bastard.

624
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:23,230
What the hell was that?

625
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:27,247
It's not every day you two are lovey-dovey.

626
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:28,843
I have to capture that.

627
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:31,125
Hello, Molly.

628
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:32,712
It's been a while. You look hotter.

629
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:34,713
Oh, you jest.

630
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:36,799
You look prettier, too, though.

631
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,871
Your hair's long now.

632
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,242
Hey, hey, hey. She's my girl.

633
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:40,895
Shut up.

634
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,190
What, you stingy bastard.

635
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:43,931
Your girlfriend is my girlfriend.

636
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:47,831
Take more photos.

637
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,054
Of me alone, that is.

638
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:50,055
Sure thing.

639
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,363
One, two, three.

640
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,234
What are you doing here all alone?

641
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,753
Why are you avoiding me?

642
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:21,473
Or is it because I'm just a nerd

643
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:23,953
and I have no place right next to you?

644
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:25,953
It's not like that.

645
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:28,073
I just want to be alone.

646
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:35,636
But isn't that lonely?

647
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:42,074
I think it'd be better if I...

648
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,033
keep you company.

649
00:33:58,264 --> 00:34:00,067
Won't you say anything?

650
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:01,431
You're normally very chatty.

651
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:10,221
Good.

652
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,073
Let me borrow your shoulder, then.

653
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:06,233
Liu, what are you doing?

654
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:08,769
You playboy!

655
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,175
Rose.

656
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:13,317
Let's go.

657
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:25,061
Ouch.

658
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:28,434
But at least I got a kiss.

659
00:35:40,276 --> 00:35:41,113
Bring it on!

660
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:42,113
Come on!

661
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:43,554
Come on!

662
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:44,825
Come on!

663
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:47,271
Come on!

664
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:50,605
Drink up!

665
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:52,061
Drink up!

666
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:23,154
Did you snap a shot?

667
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:26,994
I–I'm just trying to capture the moment.

668
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,383
If you want a photo,

669
00:36:31,384 --> 00:36:32,996
just ask.

670
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,994
I'll pose for you.

671
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,316
Alright?

672
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:51,793
What are these photos for, virgin boy?

673
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:53,792
It's for the yearbook.

674
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:55,678
Oh, then can you get some shots of us?

675
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,679
Jedi.

676
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,322
Let's take a photo.

677
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:01,548
One, two, three.

678
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:06,594
I heard you bought a vibrator.

679
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,033
Why don't you just try the real thing?

680
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:10,741
What a waste.

681
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:11,793
Yeah.

682
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:13,794
You need my help with that?

683
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:15,193
Do you?

684
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:16,983
Hey, what the hell?

685
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,116
What the hell's wrong with you?

686
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,387
Stay out of her business.

687
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:23,700
What do you care what she does?

688
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:27,307
Does it hurt your pride that women can be happy without you lot?

689
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:30,113
We can orgasm without a dick.

690
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:34,113
You hate men? You must be a lesbian.

691
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:37,114
I don't have to be a lesbian to hate you.

692
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:39,586
Use your brain instead of your dick to think for once.

693
00:37:39,587 --> 00:37:40,061
Go away.

694
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:42,130
This is no fun.

695
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:43,795
Let's go.

696
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:44,965
We'll get them next time.

697
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:11,261
Shit.

698
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:27,833
What the hell was wrong with them?

699
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,292
Oh?

700
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,089
Jean?

701
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:45,434
There you are.

702
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,647
I thought you already left.

703
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:49,196
I just gave someone a ride home.

704
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:50,599
Oh.

705
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,592
What you said earlier was freaking cool, by the way.

706
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:55,747
It was just cool.

707
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:59,673
I think so, too. Anyone can do whatever they want to pleasure themselves.

708
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:01,236
Men can do it.

709
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:02,753
Why can't women, right?

710
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:08,833
It makes me kind of happy that some men think that.

711
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,271
Doesn't everyone think that?

712
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:16,998
A vintage Polaroid camera?

713
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:18,593
Cool! Where did you buy this?

714
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:20,593
I didn't buy it.

715
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:22,313
Someone gave it to me for my birthday.

716
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:25,799
But I'm not sure if it actually works.

717
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,912
The photos just won't develop.

718
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:28,913
Really?

719
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,507
Wanna try taking a photo of me?

720
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:34,393
Sure. Can I?

721
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:35,575
Yeah.

722
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:37,394
Of course.

723
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:39,962
Where should I be?

724
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,110
Over there. Just a little further.

725
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:43,111
That's okay.

726
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:45,636
Alright, you ready?

727
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:48,690
One, two...

728
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,074
Wait.

729
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:52,074
What?

730
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,796
Can I take my top off?

731
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,831
Should you?

732
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:03,796
Like this.

733
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,388
Well, I'm taking it.

734
00:40:17,002 --> 00:40:19,554
One, two, three.

735
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,343
See how it just won't show up?

736
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:41,931
Maybe we have to wait.

737
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,033
I'll keep this.

738
00:40:50,707 --> 00:40:51,707
Can we kiss?

739
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,412
Sure.

740
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Want me to be your first time?

741
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,019
Jean, Jean.

742
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,073
Wait, Jean.

743
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,193
What is it?

744
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:33,633
I don't have a condom.

745
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,553
Gosh, you're so unprepared.

746
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:38,711
I'll...

747
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:40,633
I'll ask around.

748
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,633
Wait here.

749
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:51,877
Just wait a little.

750
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,394
I can't...

751
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:03,394
Wait here.

752
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,276
Ew?

753
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:11,791
Ew, Ew, Ew.

754
00:43:23,074 --> 00:43:24,230
Sorry, sorry.

755
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:25,233
Sorry.

756
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:26,233
Excuse me.

757
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,233
Make way.

758
00:43:30,393 --> 00:43:31,393
Ew.

759
00:43:32,105 --> 00:43:33,034
Lex.

760
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:34,351
You got a condom?

761
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:35,953
Condom?

762
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,594
Let me have one.

763
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:39,249
Here.

764
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,670
Ew, you bastard!

765
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:42,671
Wait a minute.

766
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:44,522
You want it?

767
00:43:44,523 --> 00:43:45,733
If you want it,

768
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:48,273
drink this.

769
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:49,405
Drink the whole thing.

770
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:52,473
Help me out and I'll help you.

771
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,701
The whole thing?

772
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:54,701
Yep.

773
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:56,353
Bottoms up!

774
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:59,913
Bottoms up!

775
00:43:59,914 --> 00:44:01,667
- Bottoms up! - Lex, stop it!

776
00:44:01,668 --> 00:44:02,954
You wanna pass out or something?

777
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,437
No way he will.

778
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:04,932
Do it.

779
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,527
Bottoms up!

780
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:07,034
Lex!

781
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:15,479
Bottoms up!

782
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:21,753
Respect!

783
00:44:21,754 --> 00:44:23,445
You earned my respect.

784
00:44:23,446 --> 00:44:24,753
Now that's my best friend.

785
00:44:25,064 --> 00:44:26,473
That's my best friend right there.

786
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:42,154
Yeah, this is great.

787
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,482
Hey.

788
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:47,482
Hi.

789
00:44:47,736 --> 00:44:49,954
You're looking great tonight, huh?

790
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:53,310
I need to pee.

791
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,796
Is it okay if I pee here?

792
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:58,713
Oh, you're a couple, huh?

793
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:00,877
Are you drunk, Alex?

794
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:02,034
I'm not.

795
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:06,435
I'll see you in a bit.

796
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:08,414
I just gotta go pee.

797
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:10,114
See ya. See ya.

798
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:12,513
Can I just pee here?

799
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:18,628
Joe, wait.

800
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
Alex!

801
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:21,418
Alex.

802
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:22,952
Did you see anything, Alex?

803
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:23,553
Alex!

804
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:24,545
Alex!

805
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:25,545
Shit!

806
00:45:32,203 --> 00:45:33,654
I've never kissed a guy before.

807
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:34,994
You haven't?

808
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:40,739
Why did you kiss him?

809
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:48,227
Don't resist.

810
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:49,544
Don't resist, idiot.

811
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:53,310
Get in there.

812
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,793
Congrats.

813
00:46:08,984 --> 00:46:10,796
You are no longer a virgin.

814
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:12,794
And remember...

815
00:46:13,348 --> 00:46:16,474
You didn't hear or see anything tonight.

816
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:21,359
Hey.

817
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,359
Smile for the camera.

818
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:23,913
Smile.

819
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:25,994
Hurry up.

820
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:26,938
Smile.

821
00:46:26,938 --> 00:46:27,938
Hurry.

822
00:46:33,162 --> 00:46:35,685
One, two, three.

823
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,313
Doctor, is there something wrong with my coochie?

824
00:46:53,474 --> 00:46:55,472
Doctor, is everything alright?

825
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:57,473
We're in the middle of a pelvic exam.

826
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:12,656
What the hell!

827
00:47:18,814 --> 00:47:23,744
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

828
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:25,953
I am a gynaecologist?

829
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:30,772
You're the expert on the female body.

830
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:32,811
Are you telling me this camera

831
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:35,472
takes you time travel to ten years in the future?

832
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:38,396
And these photos are telling us what will happen?

833
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:39,857
Why is he here?

834
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,153
I'm not listening to anything that traitor has to say.

835
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,179
Jean.
