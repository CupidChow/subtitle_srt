1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,334
What?

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:03,618
You want me to marry Nim?

3
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:09,438
Just think of this as a... double charity.

4
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:11,498
You get to help me. You get to help Nim.

5
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:12,670
Okay, then.

6
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:15,043
I want the best for your film, Jean.

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,818
I want it to be something of ours.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,015
You? Have kids?

9
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,617
You must really love her to do that for her.

10
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:23,375
Yeah.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,738
Say, this one guy has fun with another girl...

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,700
Would you say that's cheating?

13
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,079
Try barking.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,910
Liu.

15
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,137
Babe. Babe.

16
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:41,795
Liu. Liu!

17
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,217
Be my girlfriend.

18
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:44,319
I'm not ready.

19
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,344
And you don't have to do all this.

20
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:47,823
Kat, you witch.

21
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,217
You love playing hard to get, huh?

22
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,558
(Victim of an aggravated assault charge which causes physical and mental harms)

23
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:56,688
(Miss Katleeya Ganderton)

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,196
You love playing hard to get, huh?

25
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:25,688
(Patient: Katleeya Ganderton)

26
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:31,355
Apple?

27
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,913
Don't treat me like I'm dying.

28
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,417
I'm fine.

29
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:42,643
Liu and Rose already came crying just now.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,346
They were practically ready for my funeral.

31
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:46,817
They're just worried about you.

32
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,710
If you have something you want to get off your chest,

33
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:49,827
you can talk to me, you know?

34
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:52,073
You don't need to act tough and bottle it all up.

35
00:01:57,432 --> 00:02:00,017
I just don't understand what I did wrong.

36
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:03,617
All I did was reject him. Why'd he have to hurt me?

37
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,817
Or is this mindset and lifestyle of mine actually not okay to have?

38
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,217
But like...

39
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,817
I told him very early on that I didn't want to get serious with anyone.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,217
So what did he expect from me?

41
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:22,346
Hey.

42
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,325
You did nothing wrong.

43
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:25,602
Don't blame yourself.

44
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:28,243
The only one at fault here is him who couldn't accept the truth.

45
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,635
You have every right to turn him down.

46
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,443
He doesn't have any right to hurt you because of it.

47
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,445
So just keep living the way you always do.

48
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,346
Maybe...

49
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:42,020
I should stop sleeping around?

50
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,417
Find someone to get serious with?

51
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,309
It's not like that is going to guarantee anything.

52
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:49,941
You'll get in as much trouble if your partner's a jerk.

53
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:52,203
Why is life so freaking hard?

54
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,017
All the choices I have suck.

55
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:56,418
Should we just date?

56
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:57,886
That'll be nice.

57
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,075
Safe, for sure.

58
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,836
I don't mind, you know?

59
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,046
I have a little leaning towards women anyway.

60
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:06,017
Mind a little, will you?

61
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,617
Thanks, though.

62
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:11,449
I feel so much better now.

63
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,683
Since you're all better now,

64
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:16,817
please just eat the apple I took the effort of cutting for you.

65
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:31,903
Jean.

66
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,242
Are you here to see Kat?

67
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:37,218
Yeah.

68
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:40,067
That's nice.

69
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,640
Kat won't be so lonely with all her friends around.

70
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:44,417
She might feel safer, too.

71
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,817
Safe from what?

72
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:49,846
From that guy coming back to hurt her.

73
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:52,427
What a jerk.

74
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:54,374
Why must he hurt her just because she doesn't like him back?

75
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,443
If I see him, I'll beat him to a pulp.

76
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:58,817
Easy there, Jean.

77
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:02,024
If anyone hurts you, let me know.

78
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,691
I'm really...

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,217
You're visiting Kat as what?

80
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,617
Her boyfriend?

81
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,299
No. Kat and I are friends.

82
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,817
The same way...

83
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,217
You and I are friends.

84
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:28,817
Who says I'm your friend?

85
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:37,163
I'll go see Kat, then.

(Maybe later. I've been busy.)

105
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:18,017
Hey.

106
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,288
Army.

107
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,050
Let's have lunch.

108
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:22,817
I'm done with all my patients.

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Yeah, sure.

110
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:26,417
Fine.

111
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:32,421
You alright? You look distressed.

112
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,817
You're not your lively self.

113
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,217
It looks like you haven't slept much.

114
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,017
Is something wrong?

115
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:54,015
I think I figure out whose chest it is I'm sleeping on in your Polaroid.

116
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:56,920
Who is it?

117
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:58,008
Tell me.

118
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,694
I'll help you solve your problem.

119
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:01,840
I'll be one step closer to my goal.

120
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:04,817
I think...

121
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:07,261
It's...

122
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,064
Joe.

123
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,418
It's Joe.

124
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:14,418
Hang on.

125
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,012
Are you guys back together?

126
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:19,387
He and I just started seeing each other again.

127
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:20,418
And...

128
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:22,817
It's a long story.

129
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:23,771
How long can it be, man?

130
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:25,220
What's your problem?

131
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:28,719
I...

132
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,217
feel uncomfortable about our...

133
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,617
sex life.

134
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,017
He won't bottom for me.

135
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,236
What?

136
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,443
I want to top, too. You get me, right?

137
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,617
But he won't take it.

138
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,392
You understand, don't you?

139
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:51,272
Bottoming is tiring.

140
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,559
It's exhausting.

141
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:56,417
Like right now, I feel like I'm pampering him.

142
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,663
But if you ask me if I'm happy?

143
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:00,018
I'm not.

144
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,417
Why, though? Why doesn't he agree to it?

145
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,618
Is he afraid it's going to hurt?

146
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,470
I don't know.

147
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:10,242
Maybe he thinks bottoming makes him less manly?

148
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,430
Like it makes him the woman in the relationship or something?

149
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,760
Is that what some people think?

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,147
Hell yeah.

151
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:16,817
It's...

152
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,042
This stuff is some...

153
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,454
psychological bullcrap.

154
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:33,617
If this really is the puzzle I have to solve,

155
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,217
what can I do to help you?

156
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,617
Why don't you talk it out with him?

157
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,417
Well, it's a sensitive matter.

158
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:48,017
And he and I just got back together.

159
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,417
I...

160
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,817
don't want to lose him. Do you understand?

161
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,584
So that means

162
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:07,217
if I want to solve this to fix the Polaroid,

163
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,617
I need to talk to Joe

164
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:11,669
so he bottoms for you.

165
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,669
Hey, hey. You can't.

166
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,817
If Joe finds out, he will definitely get mad at me.

167
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,694
But I have to.

168
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,043
This is for both you and me.

169
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:26,709
Alright.

170
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:31,215
I'll certainly talk Joe into bottoming for you.

171
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,288
I got it!

172
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:26,743
I got it!

173
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:28,725
What happened?

174
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,487
I got it! I won the US green card lotto.

175
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:34,817
I got so lucky.

176
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:35,972
I'm so lucky.

177
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,217
I will live in America.

178
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:38,654
I will go to New York.

179
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:39,654
I will open a restaurant.

180
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:42,017
I can finally follow my dreams.

181
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,842
Wait, babe.

182
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,643
But I just went through with IVF.

183
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,996
They already injected the sperm and all.

184
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,595
Well...

185
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
It might not work.

186
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,303
You might not conceive.

187
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:57,458
How could you say that?

188
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,817
What if I did get pregnant?

189
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,832
If that's the case,

190
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:03,107
you can... give birth here.

191
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,820
Then you follow me there.

192
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,799
I'll already be a citizen when I'm there.

193
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,483
You can marry me.

194
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:11,346
Do you think it's all that easy?

195
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,590
I went ahead and agreed to get pregnant for you

196
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,325
because you said you wanted a baby.

197
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,429
Now what's this?

198
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,646
You won your lotto and you're gonna leave me?

199
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:19,947
Hey.

200
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,267
Can you try to be understanding?

201
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,861
Understanding of what?

202
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:25,885
Huh?

203
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,245
You keep changing your mind.

204
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,485
I have freaking sperm in my body.

205
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:33,032
What do I do if I get pregnant?

206
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:35,445
You want me to raise a child alone?

207
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:37,272
Alone?

208
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,220
Then don't be alone.

209
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,817
Be with your ex, Mollie.

210
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:48,645
I saw you two talk.

211
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:50,523
Hold on.

212
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:52,232
Talk?

213
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:53,769
It was for work.

214
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:54,730
Don't be ridiculous.

215
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,145
I'm not ridiculous.

216
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:57,467
It's obvious.

217
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:58,842
You still have feelings for each other.

218
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,417
I could tell even at the mall that day.

219
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:06,645
You can't respond to that?

220
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,617
You can't because it's the truth.

221
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,217
How are we supposed to build a future together like this?

222
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:20,417
I can tell your heart is no longer with me.

223
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,817
I think I should go.

224
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,417
I'll give you plenty of time to rekindle your old flame.

225
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:28,817
Bew.

226
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,143
Bew.

227
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,446
Joe.

228
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,846
Hi.

229
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,851
Hello...

230
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:07,258
Alex?

231
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,233
You remember me, right?

232
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,017
We went to St. Jonathan's together.

233
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:15,617
You guys used to... pull pranks on me.

234
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:16,817
Oh.

235
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,279
Yeah.

236
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,950
Why are you here, though?

237
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,310
Do you have business here?

238
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,820
It's...

239
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,417
I'm...

240
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:28,817
I- I...

241
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:32,417
I want to talk about you and Army.

242
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:36,015
What do you mean?

243
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,944
Did he send you to talk to me?

244
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,617
You're buddies, right?

245
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,867
You work at the same hospital.

246
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,749
Or are you actually one of his lovers?

247
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,205
No, I'm not.

248
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,017
Army and I really are just friends.

249
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,313
And Army doesn't have any other lovers.

250
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:53,495
You're the only one.

251
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,217
What?

252
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,118
Did he tell you about me?

253
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,855
W-Well, he and I are friends.

254
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,916
He tells me everything.

255
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,916
What?

256
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:07,218
Straight and gay guys can be friends.

257
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:10,870
What do you want?

258
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,217
Just hurry up and tell me before someone hears you.

259
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:16,817
I...

260
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,039
need to...

261
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,617
talk about your and Army's in-bed situation.

262
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:22,817
What?

263
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,149
He asked his friend to straighten out his sex life?

264
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,190
No, of course not.

265
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,089
He didn't ask me to come.

266
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:30,697
I just wanted to help.

267
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,418
How can you help?

268
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:34,789
Have you ever even slept with a guy in the first place?

269
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:35,836
Nope, I haven't.

270
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,900
But like, you don't have to actually try it to know it, you know?

271
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,817
I've looked into it a little bit. I know some of it.

272
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,214
Army is really bummed about this, you know.

273
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:46,196
He wants to feel the pleasure, too.

274
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,672
But...

275
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:50,238
You just... gotta let him do it a bit, you know?

276
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,208
Let him do what?

277
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,448
Say it!

278
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:55,384
Let him... do you.

279
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,564
Easy there, man.

280
00:14:58,589 --> 00:14:59,838
- Joe.
- What?

281
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,916
Hey, hey, Joe. Listen to me.

282
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,855
Joe, Joe, Joe, calm down.

283
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,512
- What?
- Calm down, man.

284
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,528
You gotta be considerate to have good sex, you know.

285
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,885
Give and take, as they say.

286
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:12,178
You already top, so let him do it now.

287
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,218
It's only fair, man.

288
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:16,815
Do you realise how exhausting bottoming is?

289
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,186
Well, I don't like both positions!

290
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,415
Don't you get it?

291
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:40,817
What do you mean you don't like both?

292
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:49,217
Yeah, I am gay.

293
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,360
But I don't like gay sex.

294
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,018
Does that make sense?

295
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,377
What do you mean by gay sex?

296
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:57,618
Anal sex, man.

297
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,417
I don't like banging.

298
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,618
I don't like penetration.

299
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,017
Bottoming isn't my problem,

300
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:09,014
and I don't think it makes me any less of a man.

301
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:10,640
I just don't like doing it from behind.

302
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,217
Am I still qualified as a gay dude?

303
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,617
I'm a football player, surrounded by men who like women.

304
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,617
That makes it hard enough for me.

305
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,140
I already don't fit in.

306
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,617
Now I'm gay and don't fit in with them, either.

307
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,017
I'm not like them.

308
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:31,980
I don't like penetration.

309
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,491
I don't like going to gay bars.

310
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:37,217
Where in the world can I belong?

311
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:42,017
I get it.

312
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:49,217
I think you can talk to Army about this.

313
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,217
Look at him.

314
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,617
He's 100% unquestionably gay.

315
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:02,417
It won't work between us no matter what.

316
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,780
Let's stop right there. We've got something else waiting for us.

317
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,359
Thank you.

318
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,418
Thank you, guys.

319
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:35,553
Thanks a lot.

320
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:41,446
How was it, Mollie?

321
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,217
Thanks.

322
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,289
It was great. It was fun.

323
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,449
I don't mind having a bunch of fight scenes.

324
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,538
Alright, then. I'll give it to you.

325
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,418
Is it alright with Nim?

326
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:52,827
It's alright.

327
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,614
It was over for us forever ago.

328
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:56,240
We can be friends now.

329
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,175
Okay, then.

330
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,383
I'll just wait and see you guys being "friends,"

331
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:02,417
even though I never see it end well with anyone who's said that.

332
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,442
Let's have lunch.

333
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:06,732
Let's eat.

334
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:08,417
Come have lunch, Kim.

335
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,618
I'll be there.

336
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:33,079
What's wrong?

337
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,039
Oh.

338
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:36,907
You're done training?

339
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,417
Where's the other staff?

340
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:40,815
They all went to have lunch.

341
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,412
What's wrong?

342
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,793
You don't look so well.

343
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,817
You can tell?

344
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:49,872
I'm just a little mad at life.

345
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:51,617
It gets me good this time.

346
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,343
Tell me.

347
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,217
You said we're friends, right?

348
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,017
How could she do that?

349
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:15,137
You even tried to get pregnant for her sake.

350
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,642
Leaving you now is straight up selfish.

351
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:22,817
Oh, sorry.

352
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,217
I didn't mean to bad-mouth your girlfriend.

353
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,442
I just think what you did for her was freaking huge.

354
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,817
Getting pregnant isn't something you can take lightly.

355
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,646
It will change your life.

356
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:40,817
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

357
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,642
She packed her things and left.

358
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:47,492
Isn't that too much?

359
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,017
Well...

360
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,417
What will you do now?

361
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,620
I don't know.

362
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,215
Pray I don't conceive?

363
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,817
I do hope Army's got some feeble sperm.

364
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,617
Okay, then.

365
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,749
Whatever you decide,

366
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,438
it's all up to you.

367
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,217
It's your life.

368
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,617
But don't love anyone so bad to do this much for them again.

369
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,015
I can't help it.

370
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,617
When I love, I love with all my heart and my being.

371
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:35,482
I love so much I never forget.

372
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,845
I know.

373
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,240
I remember all of it.

374
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:51,818
Umm...

375
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:56,417
I have to see the stunt doubles.

376
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:58,817
Do your best, alright?

377
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,646
I'll look out for the film.

378
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:03,617
Thank you.

379
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,667
Oh, Kim?

380
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,417
How is it? You tired?

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,312
I'm okay.

382
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:29,889
It's not too bad.

383
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,417
Sorry about the tight shoot. We really can't work out the actors' schedules.

384
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:34,892
I understand.

385
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,217
You gotta be tough working on set.

386
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,463
Kim!

387
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:48,943
Kim. Kim. Kim.

388
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,417
What's wrong, Kim?

389
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,366
I'm okay.

390
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:53,425
Help me lift her up.

391
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:58,817
Kim, your heath is important. Don't prioritise work. Take care of yourself.

392
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,217
Yes. Sorry, Jean.

393
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:03,652
Kim!

394
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,051
The patient should take a lot of rest for now and monitor her conditions.

395
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:28,243
Don't let her work too hard.

396
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:29,186
Yes.

397
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,638
Thank you, Doctor.

398
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:43,217
Is it alright for you to leave the set like this?

399
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,426
It's okay.

400
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,618
I'm more worried about you.

401
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,417
The doctor told me.

402
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,042
So you know I'm...

403
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:00,298
Yeah. I know

404
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:01,298
that you're pregnant.

405
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,417
Can I ask what you'll do next?

406
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,245
I don't know.

407
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:15,039
I just started working, too.

408
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:18,017
There's still so many things I want to try my hand at.

409
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,817
I... don't think I'm ready to have a child.

410
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:31,217
What about your boyfriend?

411
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,617
He's no better than me.

412
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,017
He's a musician.

413
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,695
And he...

414
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:40,814
He has plenty of dreams, too.

415
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,217
He's not ready.

416
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,817
I don't see a future here at all.

417
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:49,067
Come.

418
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,417
Bring it in for a hug.

419
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:55,217
Kim, are you alright?

420
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,632
I'm okay.

421
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,617
I'm just a little tired.

422
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,384
This is Jean, the director.

423
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:07,384
Hello.

424
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:09,617
She's the one who took me here.

425
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:10,815
Thank you.

426
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:12,097
It's no trouble.

427
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:14,851
You guys talk. I'll wait.

428
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:16,248
Call me if you need anything.

429
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:20,417
So what did the doctor say?

430
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:27,615
Ice...

431
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,217
I'm pregnant.

432
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,217
What?

433
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:34,818
You are?

434
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:36,018
Really?

435
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,817
The doctor confirms it.

436
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,017
Kim.

437
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:50,417
No matter what happens,

438
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,618
I am right here.

439
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:53,854
And don't you worry,

440
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,220
I will take care of you and our baby.

441
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:03,645
It's alright.

442
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:06,017
Everything will be alright.

443
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,639
Stay away.

444
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,042
Help.

445
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,073
Help me!

446
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:53,261
Stay away!

447
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:57,615
Stay away.

448
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:59,897
No!

449
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,215
Kat.

450
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,177
Alex?

451
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:10,817
Alex.

452
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,017
It's alright now, Kat.

453
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:44,417
Kat, how are you feeling? Are you feeling better?

454
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:49,217
I don't know.

455
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,617
I'm still a little shaken.

456
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:55,217
I know they arrested him.

457
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:57,617
But I still feel paranoid.

458
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:03,046
It's like I know deep down that I was the reason he attacked me.

459
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,017
I was to blame for this, too.

460
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,617
I gave him false hope, didn't I?

461
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,018
Don't think that.

462
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:15,617
You have every right to say no.

463
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:18,657
He can get mad and hold grudges,

464
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:21,040
but he has no right to hurt you.

465
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,017
Don't blame yourself.

466
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:26,417
Blame that scumbag of a man.

467
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,992
Why are you so good to me, Alex?

468
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,544
We're not lovers, you know.

469
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,417
We're friends.

470
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:42,017
Friends help each other get back up on their feet, right?

471
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,217
Thanks.

472
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:52,817
You can stay at my place for now.

473
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:55,217
Wait until you feel better before you go home.

474
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,017
Call me whenever you need me, alright?

475
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,417
I'm off to work now.

476
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,017
Hang in there.

477
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:13,264
Excuse me.

478
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:14,895
Can I have a photo?

479
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:16,243
Of course.

480
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,245
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

481
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:32,649
Jean?

482
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:34,479
Oh.

483
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:35,876
Tony. Hello.

484
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,218
Hello.

485
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:40,818
I didn't know you took an interest in art.

486
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:44,417
I didn't think I'd bump into you here, either.

487
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:47,389
You don't need to be so formal with me, you know.

488
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,217
We're working together.

489
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:51,018
Just be friendly with me.

490
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:56,417
I just want to be respectful to a top actor like you.

491
00:29:56,704 --> 00:29:58,196
You're exaggerating.

492
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,017
I'm just another guy.

493
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:03,617
Just think of me as a friend.

494
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:06,017
The closer I am to my director,

495
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,163
the better I understand you.

496
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:09,618
And that's good for my acting.

497
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:11,399
Okay, then.

498
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll get to know you better for work, too.

499
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:19,217
Actually...

500
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:21,617
It doesn't have to be strictly for work.

501
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:27,617
Let's stick with work.

502
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:30,646
Of course.

503
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:34,817
Will you let me keep you company on this gallery tour?

504
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:38,418
I'm new to the art scene.

505
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:40,817
If I don't understand some of the artwork,

506
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,697
I can ask you about it.

507
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,618
You seem so much smarter than I am.

508
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,018
You don't need to be smart to enjoy art.

509
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,883
I am not well-versed myself.

510
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,817
I just look at the artwork with my feelings.

511
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:57,040
Well, what do your feelings say about me?

512
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,356
They say...

513
00:31:04,356 --> 00:31:06,017
that you're quite a flirt, aren't you?

514
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:13,217
Well...

515
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,617
Shall we look around together?

516
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,402
Let's go.

517
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:22,018
I was dying to ask you about this piece.

518
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:22,889
Which one?

519
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,313
I really wonder what it means.

520
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,017
Hey.

521
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,295
Are you trying to dance your stress off or something?

522
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:45,472
Yeah.

523
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,633
This is my catharsis.

524
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,415
Don't get so worked up, dude.

525
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:53,272
If Joe doesn't want to do it, you just have to accept that.

526
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:55,217
You can love without sex.

527
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:57,617
No, I can't.

528
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,119
I want to do it, you get me?

529
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,617
Top or bottom or whatever, I'll be anything.

530
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:06,017
But I just want my full-course meal, you hear me?

531
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,768
I want to do it. I want him to do me.

532
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:09,718
I just want him to do me!

533
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:10,640
I don't want no appetisers.

534
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:11,831
It's not enough...

535
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,903
Pipe down. You're too loud.

536
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:15,485
You're embarrassing me. Everyone's staring.

537
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:17,485
What can you do?

538
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,417
Joe doesn't like doing it.

539
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,627
You know, ultimately, sex is about finding the middleground.

540
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:26,417
That's why you need to talk to him.

541
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:30,017
Don't act like you're all that.

542
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,417
You can't even come from your own hand.

543
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,817
You know what I think?

544
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,606
I think you're stuck here in this timeline forever,

545
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:38,230
and you just have to accept it.

546
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,544
You're going to have to hold onto that celibacy for a very long time.

547
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:44,245
Because from the look of it,

548
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:46,817
you can't possibly solve Joe's and my problem.

549
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,412
Dance, man.

550
00:32:54,017 --> 00:32:55,220
Come on here.

551
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,617
I'm fine.

552
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:11,338
Thanks, though.

553
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,771
Hey, hey, hey, hold on a sec.

554
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,006
I'm about done here...

555
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,617
Thanks.

556
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:55,361
My bad.

557
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:56,533
Please continue.

558
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:09,571
Army.

559
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:11,544
I know how we can fix your problem.

560
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,519
How?

561
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,159
Trust me when I say you don't need to put it in to enjoy sex.

562
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:23,280
Non-penetrative sex can be just as enjoyable.

563
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,741
I know that.

564
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,243
I've tried every form of outercourse there is.

565
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:33,017
But what I mean is you gotta try a full-on outercourse,

566
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:36,529
a whole multi-activity package deal.

567
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:38,501
Start with a light massage,

568
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:39,762
then some caressing,

569
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,064
and make outs.

570
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,088
Alex...

571
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:46,363
Then rub against him.

572
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:51,235
I guarantee you will both reach heaven.

573
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,297
You didn't have to do all of that, Alex.

574
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:54,086
Are you out of your mind?

575
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:55,405
Please.

576
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:56,417
Will you just try it?

577
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:58,867
Fine!

578
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,278
You're the best.

579
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:02,900
Alex!

580
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:04,168
Bastard.

581
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,168
I love you so much.

582
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:21,886
Jean...

583
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:23,672
Jean, I'm sorry.

584
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:25,218
Forgive me, Jean.

585
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,218
I like you.

586
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,217
Joe.

587
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:12,017
Why didn't you tell me you don't like penetrative sex?

588
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:14,415
I...

589
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,758
I didn't know how to break it to you.

590
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:19,217
You always go all out with everything, right?

591
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,417
Hey.

592
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,017
When it comes to someone I like,

593
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,417
I'll tone it down.

594
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:33,617
I might think a good satisfying sex needs penetration.

595
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:38,417
But I just understand that it is way more satisfying

596
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:40,817
doing it with someone you love.

597
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:46,818
One more thing, the doing it doesn't determine if someone is or isn't gay.

598
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,040
Something like this is all feelings.

599
00:37:58,147 --> 00:37:59,523
I mean it.

600
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,417
Well...

601
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:05,446
What can we do?

602
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,417
Alright.

603
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:11,443
First of all...

604
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,046
I'll gently massage you here.

605
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,217
Then I'll kiss you here.

606
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,803
And here.

607
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,045
And then here.

608
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:56,418
After that,

609
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,446
we take our bodies

610
00:39:01,525 --> 00:39:03,106
and rub it against each other.

611
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:06,589
Like this.

612
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:12,017
Now... we slowly speed up.

613
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:13,467
Faster.

614
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:16,818
Faster.

615
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,777
What are you doing?

616
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:30,843
I don't want a photo.

617
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:31,795
Why are you taking a photo?

618
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:32,701
Put that down.

619
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:33,701
Why not?

620
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,643
I want some photos with you now.

621
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:38,503
I only have ones of when we were students.

622
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,617
I got bored of those.

623
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,629
Fine. I'll do it.

624
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:44,417
But don't you dare let anyone see it.

625
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,071
I'm embarrassed enough knowing you told Alex about us.

626
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,067
Don't worry.

627
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,113
I won't tell anyone.

628
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,726
I promise.

629
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,438
Pinky promise.

630
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:58,817
I'll wait for you to be ready before I tell anyone.

631
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,217
Okay?

632
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:03,636
Alright.

633
00:40:35,112 --> 00:40:36,112
Yes!

634
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:40,817
What?

635
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:42,094
What's with you?

636
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:45,617
What is it?

637
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,015
Why are you here?

638
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:14,996
Don't come near me.

639
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:16,396
Don't come here.

640
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:18,796
Stay away

641
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:19,618
Stay away!

642
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:20,869
Stay away!

643
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,285
Stay away.

644
00:41:46,026 --> 00:41:46,953
Kat.

645
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:48,017
Finish him off.

646
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,239
Kat.

647
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:44,415
Hey.

648
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:46,817
Why are you guys here?

649
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:49,217
Alex asked us to keep you company.

650
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,583
You don't need to be scared anymore.

651
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,343
Just keep being your fabulous self.

652
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,417
Nothing can stop you from slaying.

653
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:33,808
(I think you just solved my puzzle.)

654
00:43:44,878 --> 00:43:50,048
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

655
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:51,697
Jedi.

656
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:53,245
Did you give me STDs?

657
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:55,842
These two have some trouble with HPVs.

658
00:43:56,998 --> 00:43:59,439
Why do you want to be a dad?

659
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,371
Excuse me.

660
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:03,171
You want a photo?

661
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:04,242
No.

662
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,792
I was gonna ask if you need company.

663
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:07,845
Do you remember what I told you?

664
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:10,246
I want an abortion.

665
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:15,617
Do we have a shot at being something like Rose and Jedi?
