1
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:09,238
Isn't it actually bad to take meds for cramps all the time?

2
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:13,879
This here is the relationship chart I've been preparing.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,356
But there's something wrong with these photos.

4
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:20,194
Nim, no matter how you look at it, you're freaking in labour.

5
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:21,555
Oh, fu-

6
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:23,249
Army?

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,738
Since when did you turn gay?

8
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,232
What the hell is wrong with you?

9
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:28,942
I broke up with Kat ages ago.

10
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:34,199
Our first time was... in a classroom?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,065
I thought we did it at Jedi's party.

12
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:39,520
Hello.

13
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:50,295
No. I can't do it.

14
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:51,019
I can't.

15
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:51,718
I can't.

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,718
Ma'am, where are you going?

17
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:05,108
Jean.

18
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,192
Jean, wait.

19
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:07,031
Jean.

20
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:08,197
Stop.

21
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,021
Wasn't that Jean?

22
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:11,473
The school's social activist?

23
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:12,766
Yeah.

24
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,002
What did you do to her?

25
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,880
She's clearly pissed and running away from you.

26
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:17,171
I didn't do anything.

27
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:20,021
She was here for a checkup and I was just doing my job.

28
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:22,234
No way. There must be something else.

29
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,935
You're very good at hurting other people's feelings, after all.

30
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,194
You never care how anyone feels.

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,234
You, too, huh?

32
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,192
What are you mad at me for?

33
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,234
Mad? I'm not mad at you.

34
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:36,194
What right do I have?

35
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:40,194
I'm just a gay dude who likes doing it in a parking lot,

36
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:43,420
whose best friend despises him and thinks he sleeps around.

37
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,619
Hang on a sec.

38
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,959
I don't think that.

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,528
Where'd you get that idea? That's your assumption.

40
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,957
Oh, shut it.

41
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,195
The past few days prove otherwise.

42
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:56,232
You don't want to be my friend.

43
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:00,194
That's why I always say straight and gay people can't be friends.

44
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,235
I told you that.

45
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,232
Army.

46
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,197
Army!

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,194
What the hell...

48
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,622
He doesn't mind chasing after girls.

49
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,234
But when it's me...

50
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,745
(What are you looking for?)

51
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,185
(Sex.)

52
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:43,745
(What are you looking for?)

53
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,865
(Same as you.)

54
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:51,025
(Is tonight alright?)

55
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,465
(Sure.)

56
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:56,465
(Where?)

57
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:01,025
(You got a place?)

58
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:06,065
(Yeah... Come over.)

59
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:10,185
(Alright... See you.)

60
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:32,185
Thitipoom Techa-apaikhun.

61
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,305

00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,465

00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:44,625
Thinnaphan Tantui.

69
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:45,745
Phuwin Tangsakyuen.

70
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:46,855
Chaleeda Gilbert.

00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,945
Pavida Moriggi.

00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,055
Pakin Kuna-anuwit.

73
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,145
Jira Charoenthamasuk.

74
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,815
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri.

75
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,739
What you doing?

76
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,517
Talking to your other girls?

77
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,786
There are no other girls.

78
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,442
Just checking my email to see if

79
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,169
I won the green card lotto I applied for.

80
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,521
Might get a shot at getting an American citizenship.

81
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,193
You're serious.

82
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,194
I thought you were kidding about that.

83
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,193
I am serious.

84
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:50,194
I want us to live somewhere with more opportunities.

85
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,194
I want a family.

86
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:03,022
I want to open a restaurant there.

87
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:10,004
You're not thinking of me at all, are you?

88
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,299
Your plans don't seem to include me.

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,750
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,720
We will both go.

91
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:21,581
I'll go there first to get us a head start.

92
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,582
And then you follow me.

93
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,242
Don't overthink it.

94
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:31,458
I might not even win that lottery.

95
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,429
Millions of people applied for that, you know.

96
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,267
Yesterday you wanted a kid.

97
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:39,268
Today you want to immigrate.

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,194
I can't keep up with all your big dreams, you know.

99
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:50,194
Well, I can't have kids.

100
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:52,194
Why do you have to rub that in my face?

101
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:03,673
Bew, I'm not trying to make you feel bad.

102
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:05,616
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,194
Sorry.

104
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:11,509
But think about it, Bew.

105
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:16,194
Leaving for America isn't easy for me.

106
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:18,193
Look around.

107
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:21,518
I have to take over this place after my dad.

108
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,194
What about my life and my friends?

109
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,194
They're all here.

110
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:28,924
To be honest with you,

111
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:32,194
I just can't imagine how we'll make it work.

112
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,422
Long distance relationships don't usually last.

113
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:52,192
If you can't go to America with me,

114
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,791
can you...

115
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,194
help me with something else?

116
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:02,194
This will be something we do together.

117
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,628
What do you need?

118
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,086
Tell me.

119
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:10,194
If it'll make us stay together forever,

120
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:13,717
I'll do anything.

121
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:15,717
Really?

122
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:20,194
Well...

123
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,788
Can you... carry a child for me?

124
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,932
From the way I look at it.

125
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:47,153
I think it's safe to say that these photos

126
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,154
really do tell us about our future.

127
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,194
Because right now, Bew wants a child,

128
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,423
but because of her health, she can't have one.

129
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,805
Now she wants me to get pregnant for her.

130
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,324
And you're okay with that?

131
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,671
I don't know.

132
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:05,672
Me? A mother?

133
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:08,718
I couldn't even take care of a pet goldfish.

134
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:24,194
Ew, why do you have a freaking dog mask in your bedroom?

135
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,453
It's nothing.

136
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,076
Just some fancy mask.

137
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,077
It's a hit at parties.

138
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:37,019
What kind of party do you go to that needs that kind of mask?

139
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,190
What's this?

140
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,191
A full-option leather set?

141
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:44,194
Wait...

142
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:47,502
This looks exactly like the getup you get arrested in in that photo.

143
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,194
Ew.

144
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,563
What's all this?

145
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,774
Tell us right now what these are for.

146
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:01,563
Yeah, what do you do with this?

147
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:02,982
Tell us what's going on.

148
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,017
- Tell us. - We need to know what's going to happen.

149
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:06,914
- Yeah. - We need to solve the puzzle in your photo.

150
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:07,865
You keep secrets from me?

151
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:08,709
Why won't you tell us?

152
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,550
- Yeah, why? - Why do you have to keep this a secret?

153
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,106
Tell us.

154
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:12,106
Tell us!

155
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:14,194
I enjoy playing a dog!

156
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,122
I've never seen anything like this.

157
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,192
That makes two of us.

158
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,617
Are you... normal?

159
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:34,259
See?

160
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,194
You're my friends and even you think I'm not normal.

161
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:45,527
The fact is this is just a sexual preference.

162
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:49,120
Some people like doing it in uniforms.

163
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,622
Some people like doing it outdoors.

164
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,046
Some people like leather suits,

165
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,924
whips, and candles.

166
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:59,521
And I just like playing a dog.

167
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:03,326
I like being ordered around, pet and cuddled.

168
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,521
Is that so weird?

169
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,741
It's called puppy play.

170
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,615
Do you... do it with Liu in that getup?

171
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,226
No.

172
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:17,022
The pleasure isn't always the sex itself.

173
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,949
It just makes me happy to act like a dog.

174
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,893
I get to forget for a moment who I really am.

175
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:24,936
Is Liu okay with this?

176
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,517
The reason we've been dating so long

177
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,192
is because Liu understands my preference.

178
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,023
Something like this

179
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,194
needs both parties' consent.

180
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:41,220
Well...

181
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:45,036
We understand you now.

182
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:47,694
But this is just my fair warning.

183
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:50,194
If my photo has the possibility to come true,

184
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:54,194
there could be something behind yours.

185
00:10:58,203 --> 00:10:59,222
Lex.

186
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,118
Now you know your two best friends' problems.

187
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,195
What about your other best friend, Army?

188
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:08,217
Does he ever tell you anythng?

189
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,991
You two are damn close, he must have told you something, right?

190
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,454
Who is this guy?

191
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:18,194
What if he sleeps with the wrong people and gets himself arrested?

192
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,745
(Where are you?)

193
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,465
(Right outside your door.)

194
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,194
Come on in.

195
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:10,971
Wait.

196
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:12,194
Let's talk.

197
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,508
You look even younger in person.

198
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,295
You like that?

199
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:18,296
Hell yeah.

200
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:21,223
I got all excited just seeing your photo.

201
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,194
What do you prefer?

202
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,194
What do you mean?

203
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,193
You know what I mean.

204
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:35,206
Me?

205
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,388
I'm fine with anything.

206
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,823
Depends on the occasion and the mood.

207
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:40,197
I like that.

208
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,203
I'm like that, too.

209
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,306
Are you?

210
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:45,091
Just go with the mood.

211
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:46,195
What about now?

212
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:48,195
What do you feel like right now?

213
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,195
It's your home field.

214
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll be the away team this time around.

215
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:55,320
You play football?

216
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,320
Alright, then.

217
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:09,185
You ready?

218
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,539
Yeah.

219
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,192
Let me go to the bathroom for a bit.

220
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:13,913
Make yourself at home.

221
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,217
It's over there.

222
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,220
Hey, your mother is calling.

223
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,192
It's fine. Just let it ring.

224
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,705
(AD 2005)

225
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,197
What are you doing?

226
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,277
Wait a sec.

227
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:07,870
You're 17?

228
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,918
Yeah.

229
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,139
What? Is there a problem?

230
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,918
Well, yeah. You're a minor.

231
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,241
I don't want to go to jail.

232
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:19,422
I thought you were in your early 20's.

233
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,194
You're still in high school, aren't you?

234
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,194
Come on.

235
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,194
Who else would know?

236
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,225
Nope. I'm not doing it.

237
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,226
Aren't you?

238
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,194
Take a little risk, will you?

239
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:43,483
No, no, no.

240
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:44,799
I can't.

241
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,195
You're a minor.

242
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:50,969
If I risk sleeping with you and there's a problem later,

243
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,194
my life is ruined.

244
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,329
If you need sex, go to someone your own age.

245
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,876
But I wanna do it with you.

246
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,194
If you're so horny...

247
00:14:58,653 --> 00:14:59,604
just find something else to do.

248
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:02,193
Like what? Play football?

249
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,622
I play football every day and that never freaking helps.

250
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,194
Even kids like me have needs, you know.

251
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Nope.

252
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,420
I insist.

253
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:23,867
Here.

254
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:26,193
Put your clothes back on. I'll walk you out.

255
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:27,194
Okay?

256
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,120
Can I at least stay the night?

257
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,194
If I go home right now, my mother is going to kill me.

258
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,215
Just let me sleep here. I'll take the sofa.

259
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,124
- Hold on. - Please?

260
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:40,967
Pretty please?

261
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,194
I won't do anything but sleep.

262
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,708
Wait a sec.

263
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,387
What difference does it make going home now and going in the morning?

264
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,617
I can tell her I have a sleepover at a friend's.

265
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,617
Just one night, please?

266
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,617
I have nowhere else to go.

267
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,194
Do you prefer I go online

268
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:00,194
and find someone who lets me stay with him who...

269
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:04,194
isn't serious about my age like you are?

270
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:09,120
If something happened to me, it could become your problem.

271
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:12,364
Please?

272
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,346
Please?

273
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:16,194
Pretty please?

274
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:18,198
Fine.

275
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:20,283
Put on your clothes. I'll get you some blankets.

276
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:21,595
Okay.

277
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,357
Sleep over there.

278
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Here we are.

279
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,466
Okay.

280
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,194
Thank you.

281
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:52,166
Don't ever do this again, you hear?

282
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,615
Don't lie to anyone.

283
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:57,086
You may be lucky nothing bad happens to you this time,

284
00:16:57,595 --> 00:17:00,724
but that doesn't mean you'll get lucky again.

285
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:03,994
These laws are written to protect you, you know.

286
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,417
Do you understand?

287
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,935
You lecture me more than my own mother does.

288
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:09,634
What a turn off.

289
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,257
Okay, then.

290
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:12,257
I'm gone.

291
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:12,954
Bye.

292
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:14,194
Yeah.

293
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:16,019
I don't want another lecture from an old man.

294
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,532
You... brat.

295
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,066
I gave you a ride, didn't I?

296
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:24,195
How dare he?

297
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:33,737
Hey.

298
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:34,739
Time to practise.

299
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:09,223
Hi, Joe.

300
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:14,195
You're a coach here?

301
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:16,324
Why are you here?

302
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,194
I gave him a ride.

303
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:25,020
Cha Yen?

304
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:27,823
What do you have to do with him?

305
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:32,194
Don't tell me you slept with one of my athletes.

306
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,691
You bastard.

307
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,557
He's a minor. How could you?

308
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,585
I'm going to have you arrested.

309
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,856
Hold on.

310
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,127
Listen to me.

311
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,438
Let go of me.

312
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:48,192
I... I didn't sleep with him.

313
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,993
He was looking for someone to hook up with online and came to me.

314
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:54,194
Once I realised he's 17,

315
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:56,194
I backed away.

316
00:18:57,681 --> 00:19:01,521
And I only gave him a ride because he asked me to.

317
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,499
That's really all that happened.

318
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Well then, leave him alone from now on.

319
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,123
And don't ever show your face here again.

320
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:15,222
You're trouble.

321
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,197
Anyone who gets close to you gets in trouble.

322
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:36,957
Listen up.

323
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:40,194
I've made up my mind to get pregnant for my girlfriend's sake.

324
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,193
Damn.

325
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,141
I already can't wait to meet your kid.

326
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,194
But have you found the father?

327
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,852
Whose sperm are you gonna borrow?

328
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Alex.

329
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:52,844
Be the father of my child.

330
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,195
Are you sure?

331
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:57,477
Why me?

332
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:58,776
I am damn sure.

333
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,117
It has to be you.

334
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:03,046
I've thought about it, you're more than qualified.

335
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:07,467
You've got looks, nice complexion, perfect physique, intelligence and brain.

336
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,911
See how fitting you are to be the father of my child?

337
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,194
How could you overlook me like that, Nim?

338
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:19,916
I'm hot and good-looking. My brain rivals Einstein's.

339
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:20,932
Listen.

340
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:25,625
With my genes, your child will be a genius.

341
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:29,016
Oh, my, Ew.

342
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:32,195
Idiot, I want a human baby. Not puppies.

343
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,123
Uncalled for.

344
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,419
I'm sensitive about that.

345
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,926
No, but this is serious business.

346
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,677
I need time to think.

347
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,616
I can't give you an answer right now.

348
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:46,837
You must.

349
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,194
You need to help me.

350
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:51,442
Think of it as your way of making up for what you did to me in the past.

351
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:57,496
What's more, helping me might help you solve your time-travel puzzle bullcrap.

352
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,852
I need you to be my husband.

353
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,620
Don't corner me like that.

354
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,195
I promise I'll help.

355
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:10,947
But first, you two need to help me decide if I should go see Mollie.

356
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:14,197
I need to know about the photo and I want to know if I...

357
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,168
slept with her that night.

358
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,118
I need to know the whole truth.

359
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,677
Just go if you want to.

360
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:26,194
What does she do now?

361
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:30,194
Auditioning, I think.

362
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:32,193
How'd you know?

363
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,194
You stalking her? You stalking your ex?

364
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:35,944
Stalking, my ass.

365
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:39,974
I just see it on her Instagram.

366
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:42,191
I ain't stalking nobody, asshat.

367
00:21:58,302 --> 00:21:59,451
Oh, hey.

368
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,331
Fill in this form while you wait.

369
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,771
I'll call you when it's your turn.

370
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:03,917
Yes.

371
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:07,552
Excuse me.

372
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,551
Do you have correction tape?

373
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,521
Just cross it out.

374
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,139
I'll make the whole world know

375
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,918
that even a weak, whimpering, sensual woman,

376
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,918
can kill.

377
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,379
Cut.

378
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,142
Thank you.

379
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:42,194
We'll get your profile over there.

380
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,194
What do you think, Jean? You like her?

381
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,736
Not really.

382
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,580
She's good.

383
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,630
Her acting's just not fresh.

384
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:57,067
I don't feel anything when I look at her.

385
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:59,003
I get it that you're picky.

386
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,284
It's your first film, after all.

387
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:05,661
It's not easy for a female director to direct an action film.

388
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:07,554
It's not even all that action.

389
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,194
This is still a male-lead investigation film.

390
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,615
But I just want a female lead who's... different.

391
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:17,320
I don't want to fetishise her for some guys' viewing pleasure.

392
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,320
Okay, then.

393
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,882
You can be as picky as you want with the female lead.

394
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,290
Because you can't do that with the male lead.

395
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,194
The investor has someone in mind, huh.

396
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:31,111
What do you guys call it again?

397
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,108
The "default hero" actor?

398
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:32,900
Yep.

399
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:36,790
I don't like actors who get their roles without auditioning.

400
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,403
I don't even know who he is

401
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:40,194
or if he's good at what he does.

402
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,115
What's the point of his looks if he's bad at acting?

403
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:45,247
Do you want me to act out a scene for you?

404
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,871
If it's for you, I wouldn't mind going through auditions.

405
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:56,975
Hello, Tony.

406
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:58,194
Hi.

407
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,920
I don't want you to think

408
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:04,194
I got into showbiz by my looks alone.

409
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,194
I can prove I have talents.

410
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,195
Hello.

411
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:18,194
Thank you for being interested in my little project.

412
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:23,521
I actually said yes to this role because you're the director.

413
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,194
I got hooked on your amazing mindset when we went on that show together.

414
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:33,212
Next one, please.

415
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:37,022
Hello. Please introduce yourself.

416
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:39,606
Hello.

417
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:41,219
My name's Mollie.

418
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:43,886
Did you get your script?

419
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,115
Yes.

420
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:48,195
You're auditioning for the role of the best friend, right?

421
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,848
I'm auditioning for the Lady Killer role.

422
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:53,324
The female lead role.

423
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,194
Take it away.

424
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,194
You think I'm not suited to be a killer

425
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:19,223
because I am a woman?

426
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:24,194
You think I should put on a sexy dress,

427
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,194
be the decoy,

428
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:30,194
and end up in bed with you.

429
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,631
Don't you?

430
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,194
You think I should cry,

431
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,194
be scared of gunshots,

432
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,622
and wait for you to protect me.

433
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,194
Don't you?

434
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:48,194
Why should I let someone take care of me

435
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:51,263
when I am more than capable of doing it by myself?

436
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:58,194
This world doesn't have a place for women like me.

437
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:04,194
If I want something, I need to fight for it.

438
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:13,124
And now I am ready to make the whole world know

439
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:17,666
that even a weak,

440
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,195
whimpering,

441
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,195
sensual woman,

442
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,615
can kill.

443
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,192
Mollie.

444
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:38,864
Is something the matter?

445
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:39,564
Did I do something wrong?

446
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,565
No, not at all.

447
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,195
I'm just saying hello.

448
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:45,226
Did we... go to the same school?

449
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,194
Your name's Jean?

450
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:50,925
You're Jean!

451
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:51,860
St. Jonathan's?

452
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,294
I'm a year lower than you at school.

453
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,028
You're the social activist Jean?

454
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:59,123
"Free tampons! Women deserve free tampons!"

455
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:03,109
That's me. The girl who always got in trouble with the teachers.

456
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:04,912
Loved that.

457
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,222
But I'm just here to tell you that I really liked your acting.

458
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,194
I'm the director.

459
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:14,241
For real?

460
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,194
That's amazing.

461
00:27:16,692 --> 00:27:19,711
I didn't know how I did. I was too busy being nervous.

462
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:22,779
But well, do take me into your consideration, Director.

463
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,052
But if I'm going to get this role, I want it to be with my own talents, you know.

464
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:29,233
Don't give me special treatment just 'cause we went to the same school.

465
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:29,884
Don't worry about that.

466
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,788
I'm not a fan of nepotism.

467
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,295
Great.

468
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:36,723
Hold on.

469
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,354
Are you alright, Jean?

470
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:43,118
I'm fine. It's just...

471
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,194
I have really bad period cramps.

472
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:49,163
I think you need to see a doctor for that.

473
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:53,809
Why don't you go see that guy?

474
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,209
Alex, is it?

475
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,667
Was he in the same year with you?

476
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:59,523
He's a gynaecologist at this famous hospital now.

477
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:03,822
I'm fine.

478
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:07,625
The casting team will contact you. Hope to work with you.

479
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,525
I hope so, too.

480
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,197
Please take care of me.

481
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,197
Bye.

482
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,717
Cheers!

483
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:26,192
Bottoms up.

484
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,109
Slow down.

485
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,194
You're gonna be dead drunk.

486
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:32,036
This is nothing.

487
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:32,849
I'm not going to be drunk.

488
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,192
I can hold my liquor, you know.

489
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:37,619
And if I really do get drunk, you'll take care of me, right?

490
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,869
I bet it's gonna be a steamy night for you guys, huh?

491
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,089
He's probably drinking to get in the mood.

492
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:46,399
What do you have to say, Kim?

493
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,194
Is Ice doing his job properly?

494
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,192
Nosy.

495
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:55,423
That's cold.

496
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:58,194
I'm just curious. You guys have been dating for years.

497
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:01,405
Is he even good in bed?

498
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,083
Or does it get boring doing it with him?

499
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:06,030
Hey, jerk. It ain't your business.

500
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:07,422
Show her some respect.

501
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:11,022
I'm only asking out of concern, buddy.

502
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:15,422
Oh, by the way. I've made up my mind.

503
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,951
I'm having mine injected.

504
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:17,985
Have what injected?

505
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:19,461
My dick, what else!

506
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,151
Are you for real?

507
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:22,711
I heard it's dangerous.

508
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,232
What are they even injecting in there?

509
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:26,194
No, look.

510
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:27,963
I know the guy who knows about this.

511
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:30,195
They'll take good care of me.

512
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,194
Why, though? Is your thing small?

513
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,195
No. My thing is big.

514
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:35,939
I just want it bigger.

515
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,103
I'm a standard 52, but I want to be an XL.

516
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:41,615
Isn't that too big?

517
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:43,326
Listen to me.

518
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:46,194
Women like it big.

519
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:48,194
You gotta satisfy them.

520
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:49,919
Make them moan.

521
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,483
Keep it big.

522
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:54,194
Women only care about size.

523
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:57,620
What say you? Wanna come with me?

524
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,195
Hope yours rot and fall off.

525
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,216
Was that alright?

526
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:16,194
It was.

527
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:18,194
Did you come?

528
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:21,518
No. But it's alright. That's not always the goal.

529
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:25,582
Does that mean I never make you come?

530
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,194
Or did you fake it, like they said women usually do?

531
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,524
Hey, what's wrong?

532
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,817
I never fake it.

533
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:35,817
I'm just tired today.

534
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,699
I feel bad.

535
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,540
It's like I'm the only one having a good time.

536
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,582
I'm enjoying this, too.

537
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:48,192
I just don't always come.

538
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:51,118
I like that you do, though.

539
00:30:56,376 --> 00:31:00,194
Hey, are you thinking about that dick size talk?

540
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:06,811
Come on. Don't listen to them. What do they even know?

541
00:31:06,812 --> 00:31:08,197
All they talk about is size.

542
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:14,194
I think they got that idea from porn where women gotta go...

543
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,993
Kim, stop.

544
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:19,115
Kim, stop it.

545
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,197
Dad will hear you.

546
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:26,194
You know...

547
00:31:26,714 --> 00:31:29,105
Not all women care about size.

548
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:32,194
It's all about techniques and foreplays,

549
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:35,674
and how much they feel they're cared for.

550
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,194
Most men don't care about that.

551
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,339
They shoot and shake, and back to scrolling on their phone.

552
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,123
But you... You're doing very great.

553
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:48,192
One more thing,

554
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,194
your size is way above average.

555
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,194
I just want to make sure you're happy.

556
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,194
I am already very happy.

557
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:03,219
Don't let anyone ruin your confidence.

558
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:05,366
Don't listen to your toxic friends.

559
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:07,220
They don't know anything.

560
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,899
Wanna go for another round?

561
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,620
I wanna satisfy you.

562
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:17,701
You up for this?

563
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,303
Oh, come on.

564
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,191
I'm always up for this.

565
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:21,229
No need to ask.

566
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:22,229
Come on here.

567
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,194
Come here.

568
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,194
We're out of condoms.

569
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,194
It's fine. Let's do it raw.

570
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,194
You sure?

571
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:45,902
I take contraceptives anyway.

572
00:32:45,903 --> 00:32:47,508
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:33:58,666 --> 00:33:59,666
Jean.

574
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,191
We meet again.

575
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:02,197
You swim here, too?

576
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,197
Not really.

577
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,197
I'm just showing off my gorgeous body.

578
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:10,194
You know I'll believe you, right?

579
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:14,194
Actually, I've always admired your attitude, Kat.

580
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:16,178
Is that a dig at me?

581
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,861
It is not a dig at all.

582
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:19,324
I mean it.

583
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:24,194
I like women who know what they want and just go for it.

584
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:28,194
It would be nice if I was half as confident as you are.

585
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,194
How are your period cramps now?

586
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,194
Did you see a doctor?

587
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,198
I did.

588
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,611
But I'm not impressed with my doctor

589
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:53,499
so I think I'm going to ask for another one.

590
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:00,194
So you...

591
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:04,191
met Alex?

592
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,031
Jean.

593
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,915
Do you have a boyfriend?

594
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:24,296
No.

595
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,360
It's too much trouble.

596
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,194
It's not for me.

597
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:29,277
Good.

598
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:31,233
Let's hang out together sometimes.

599
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:34,194
We'll have a night out at bars, single women-only.

600
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:38,194
All my friends, Liu and Rose, are both so tied up with their boyfriends.

601
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,194
So now I have to be alone.

602
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:43,683
Does it bother you that they only spend time with their boyfriends?

603
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:45,766
Well...

604
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:46,993
A little.

605
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:48,194
But I understand.

606
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,194
It's just not for me.

607
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,717
I just don't like depending on someone else to make me happy.

608
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:56,194
If they were gone one day,

609
00:35:56,444 --> 00:35:58,194
my life would derail.

610
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,022
Nothing's better than making myself happy.

611
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:06,194
We should let go of things like men who've hurt us in the past.

612
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:09,286
It's better to just enjoy ourselves.

613
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,425
Hey, kid.

614
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,622
Do you know Coach Joe?

615
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:55,654
Yes. He's my coach.

616
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:56,572
You have business with him?

617
00:36:56,573 --> 00:36:58,036
Oh, not really.

618
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:00,147
I'm a friend of his.

619
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,194
I was thinking of him so I thought I'd drop by.

620
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:04,870
I think you can just go see him.

621
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:06,015
He's probably done with work.

622
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,117
Is he?

623
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:09,725
I have something personal to talk to him about.

624
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:12,194
Do you know if he has an office?

625
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:14,978
Just walk down this way.

626
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,195
It's the locker room.

627
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:18,285
Walk straight here and turn left?

628
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:18,986
Yeah.

629
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,837
Okay.

630
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:20,941
Thanks, kid.

631
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:22,195
Go home.

632
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:37,619
Army?

633
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:39,622
What are you doing here?

634
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,698
This is the club's locker room.

635
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,699
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

636
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,194
I think you need to leave before someone sees you.

637
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:48,194
No one will.

638
00:37:48,457 --> 00:37:51,469
I made sure that your students have already left.

639
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,194
That's why I'm waiting for you here.

640
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,194
I have nothing to say to you.

641
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,194
You need to leave.

642
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,622
Get out.

643
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:05,623
What do you want from me?

644
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:08,194
I don't want to talk to you.

645
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:11,121
Stop being so insistent.

646
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:16,194
What do I have to do for you to finally forgive me?

647
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,819
How many years have I been apologising?

648
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,197
Just give in already.

649
00:38:21,213 --> 00:38:24,194
I think I was clear when I said I'd never forgive you.

650
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,117
You need to leave.

651
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,217
Get out.

652
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:30,603
Get out.

653
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,023
I'm not going.

654
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,194
Go ahead.

655
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:42,852
If hurting me makes you happy,

656
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,195
I'll take it.

657
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,194
Go on.

658
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:03,721
Army.

659
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:05,622
Listen to me.

660
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:07,727
I'm begging you.

661
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,727
I'm a coach here.

662
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:12,195
Students look up to me.

663
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:15,111
If you're around me like this,

664
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:16,529
what would people think?

665
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,713
Are you saying no one here knows you're gay?

666
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,195
Hell yeah.

667
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:23,222
I am a coach of a boys' football team.

668
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:26,194
Do you think people would be okay if they know I'm gay?

669
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,194
I'm not a doctor

670
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:33,023
who has fun sleeping around like you.

671
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,023
Hold on.

672
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:38,194
How do you know that?

673
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,223
Wait...

674
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:44,197
You keep track of me?

675
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:49,452
Hey.

676
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,194
I may sleep around a little bit,

677
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:56,194
but I never forget my first kiss.

678
00:39:58,404 --> 00:40:02,194
Do you remember our kiss... at the party?

679
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:05,149
No.

680
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:05,942
I was drunk.

681
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:07,628
I do remember.

682
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,628
I never forget it.

683
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,192
I remember it well.

684
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,205
Then you probably shouldn't forget

685
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:17,124
what you did to me.

686
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:19,620
And I haven't.

687
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,194
I was a jerk.

688
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,194
I admit that.

689
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:28,194
That's stuck with me all these years.

690
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:34,194
I just hope that one day you'll talk to me again.

691
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,234
One day...

692
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,115
you'll kiss me again.

693
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:47,517
Is that... possible?

694
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,721
I miss you.

695
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,195
Every day.

696
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm sorry.

697
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:44,622
I really miss you.

698
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:45,953
Why are you apologising?

699
00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:47,745
Stop apologising.

700
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:51,053
Then just tell me you forgive me.

701
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,332
Tell me.

702
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,194
Is this really the time for that?

703
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:58,961
I'll keep apologising until you forgive me.

704
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:07,022
I–I forgive you.

705
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:19,820
Mr. Joe?

706
00:42:20,072 --> 00:42:21,820
Are you here?

707
00:42:25,815 --> 00:42:33,345
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri.

708
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,625
I don't remember taking a photo of you in this outfit.

709
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:39,124
Who the hell are you?

710
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:41,874
It's Ladies' Night.

711
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,425
Are you looking for your next victim?

712
00:42:44,026 --> 00:42:45,425
Nim?

713
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,816
Where's your girlfriend?

714
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:50,194
My girlfriend?

715
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:51,410
Nim.

716
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:57,123
What does "non-binary" mean?

717
00:42:57,429 --> 00:43:00,195
Is there a problem, Siam?
