1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,744
I know what happened at Jedi's now.

2
00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:04,581
Jean told me everything... every messed up thing I did.

3
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:05,602
What the hell are you two doing?

4
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:07,036
Joe, what the hell?

5
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:08,509
You have a crush on me?

6
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:10,799
Let's make a fair deal.

7
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,112
If sex is good,

8
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,310
we can be friends with benefits.

9
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:16,020
I think you just solved Mollie's issue.

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,611
You're heading in the right direction.

11
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,509
You need to do whatever it takes for Jean to forgive you.

12
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,661
I think Jean is the key to all of this.

13
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:25,239
Ever since that day, I've been trying to start over with someone new.

14
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,239
But every time, I get flashbacks from that night.

15
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,368
Just try to understand.

16
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:30,107
Jean.

Alex.

34
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,850
Lex!

35
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,421
Yep? What? Yep.

36
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,907
Why are you making that face?

37
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:43,932
Am I such a sorry thing to look at?

38
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,907
No. I was just thinking of something else.

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,109
Oh, bastard.

40
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:51,134
Shouldn't you be focusing on examining me?

41
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,709
Nurse, can you step outside for a bit?

42
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:58,910
Yes.

43
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,532
Thank you.

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,633
Sorry.

45
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:08,509
I was lost in thoughts about Jean.

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,109
I apologised

47
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:14,510
and tried to make up

48
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,392
but she wouldn't talk to me at all.

49
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:19,309
You need to give her some time.

50
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,288
This is a big deal.

51
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,716
Think about it.

52
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,248
You did that to her.

53
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,509
You gave her bad sex memories.

54
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:30,738
What if she closed herself off from having sex with anyone ever again?

55
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,204
That's real bad, you know?

56
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,509
Why the hell did I do that to Jean?

57
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,109
That's why I tried to stop you from getting wasted that time.

58
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,909
You're supposed to drink the alcohol, not let it consume you.

59
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:51,709
By the way...

60
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,109
If we're gonna be talking about this,

61
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,132
can I at least get off this freaking table first?

62
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:59,532
It's embarrassing spouting this

63
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:02,510
inspirational crap with my legs spread, you know.

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,709
Sorry. Get off of there.

65
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,590
Careful now.

66
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,396
You already solved Mollie's issue.

67
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,916
Now it's my turn.

68
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:12,698
Yeah.

69
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:14,509
I've decided to get pregnant for Bew.

70
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,109
Now you have to marry me so we can start working on the IVF.

71
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:19,869
Yeah, sure.

72
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,455
But...

73
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:22,707
I don't have to actually sleep with you, do I?

74
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:24,110
No.

75
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,177
What?

76
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:26,512
Do you want to?

77
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:28,912
Nope.

78
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:33,713
Nim, wait.

79
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,110
Did you forget something?

80
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,509
I can't orgasm, did you forget that?

81
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,433
Crap.

82
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,307
What the hell should I do now?

83
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:48,109
Dude, I really think you're the best sperm donor for me, you know?

84
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:55,981
Nim.

85
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:57,710
I got it.

86
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,509
There's one guy who's almost equal to me in every way.

87
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:06,110
He's good-looking, has a great career, and smart.

88
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,238
But...

89
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,592
You might not like him much.

90
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,130
Who is it?

91
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:20,932
Listen.

92
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:22,727
Jedi owns this bar.

93
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,784
There's a Gays' Night here every weekend.

94
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,913
I always hang out here.

95
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,709
Do you?

96
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:28,398
Yeah.

97
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:31,309
I've never been somewhere with so many gay guys in one place before.

98
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:32,509
Why not?

99
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,463
Isn't it nice?

100
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,109
To be with people of the same flock?

101
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,759
Is that necessary?

102
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,836
We're people, not animals.

103
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:43,309
It's not like we need a flock.

104
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,509
Hey.

105
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:48,109
There's such a thing as solo predators.

106
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:50,507
Like me.

107
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,535
But right now, I'm no longer solo.

108
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,509
I've got my mate.

109
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:00,110
- We're in public.
- Army!

110
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,815
Jedi, my man.

111
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,695
I thought you wouldn't come this week.

112
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:08,138
Come on. Have I ever missed Gays' Nights at your club?

113
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,909
I forgot this is your weekly hunting ground.

114
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:14,036
But you're not allowed to bag my bartender again, you hear me?

115
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,307
Oh, Joe.

116
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,233
It's been a while. How you doing, man?

117
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:22,706
So you're here, too?

118
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,109
Well...

119
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:30,109
I'm with Army.

120
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,710
Oh, so you two are...

121
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,310
I get it.

122
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:39,587
Enjoy the night, Joe.

123
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:41,587
You can be yourself here.

124
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:43,309
Everything's on the house tonight.

125
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,261
Alright?

126
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:44,970
Do you mean it?

127
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,490
Of course.

128
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,430
Bring the booze, bro.

129
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,958
Welcome to the club, man.

130
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,561
The usual?

131
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,310
The usual.

132
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,109
Wanna dance?

133
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,310
Look.

134
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:56,510
Hear the music.

135
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,510
Dance?

136
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,507
What are you doing?

137
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,909
Come on.

138
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,980
(I miss my girls! I'm so bored. When can we meet up?)

139
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,162
Hey there.

140
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:31,307
You never answer my calls anymore, you know that?

141
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,288
Yeah. I've been busy.

142
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:34,307
Where are you?

143
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:35,850
At the office.

144
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,938
Hello, lonely bitches.

145
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,184
Hello, Mrs. I-Marry-Into-Money.

146
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:41,778
Rude.

147
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,510
I'm not even married and I am already a house-freaking-wife.

148
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,802
Hi, girls.

149
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,078
How are you guys?

150
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:51,078
I was fine until you showed your face.

151
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,909
I see you still have a nasty tongue.

152
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:54,737
Babe.

153
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:55,854
I'm gonna work out some more.

154
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,186
Alright.

155
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:58,752
Bye.

156
00:07:58,752 --> 00:07:59,657
See you guys.

157
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,956
You're quite busy yourself, Kat.

158
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:04,909
You're chewing boys like toys.

159
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,309
Did you bang the whole damn crew in the airline?

160
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,107
Captain.

161
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:12,916
Yes?

162
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,070
These are my friends, Rose and Liu.

163
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:16,116
Hi there.

164
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,275
Hi.

165
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:18,445
Hello.

166
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:20,509
You girls are chatting so early in the day, I see?

167
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:25,912
Liu, dear.

168
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:29,605
Come see me in my office with the business plan in half an hour.

169
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:30,162
Yes.

170
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:30,990
See you.

171
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,986
Yes.

172
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:36,076
Your boss looks kind.

173
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:38,488
He doesn't tell you off for being on the phone during office hours.

174
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:39,709
And he's got such a sweet mouth.

175
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:42,358
Had it been Jedi, he would have blown you off.

176
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:45,404
Oh, old news. We're tired of hearing you show off your rich boytoy.

177
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:47,638
Let's scatter, sis. Bye.

178
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,309
Bye.

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,709
Bye guys.

180
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,860
You girls done talking?

181
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,284
It was nothing about me, I hope?

182
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,041
Of course it was.

183
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,767
Aren't friends supposed to gossip about their boyfriends together?

184
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,109
Is there even something about me worth gossiping about?

185
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,981
I'm such a great boyfriend.

186
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,909
I take good care of you and give you a comfortable life.

187
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,669
There's nothing to talk about.

188
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,186
Is there?

189
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,319
Stop it, Mister.

190
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:22,276
You're so sweaty.

191
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,109
You stink. Go take a shower.

192
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,100
But you said it turns you on.

193
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,263
Well, it used to.

194
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:31,309
But after all these years, it gets old, babe.

195
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:32,512
What?

196
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,823
Did you find someone who does it better than I do?

197
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,309
Someone who smells better?

198
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,042
I'm not telling you.

199
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,135
We agreed this would be an open relationship.

200
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,309
So... don't ask, don't tell.

201
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:45,709
I ain't telling you who I bang.

202
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,543
Fine.

203
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:48,738
I get it.

204
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,172
Okay, then.

205
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,109
But if I find someone, too, don't you even dare sulk.

206
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,509
Oh, babe.

207
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:07,309
But I don't want you to forget my scent.

208
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:10,909
And? What're you gonna do about it?

209
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,935
I'm gonna make you realise who does it best.

210
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:54,109
I guess this relationship is no longer open?

211
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,709
It was your idea in the first place, you know?

212
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,309
Am I good at this?

213
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,709
You're the best.

214
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:13,861
What's wrong?

215
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,137
Did you get tired?

216
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,909
No.

217
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,709
The tip kinda hurts.

218
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:24,109
Hold on.

219
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,509
I'll go to the toilet.

220
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,484
What?

221
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,870
You want me to marry Nim

222
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,709
and be the father to her child?

223
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,735
It's nothing that serious.

224
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,999
You just have to sign the marriage certificate

225
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,909
and donate your sperms so Nim can get pregnant in vitrio.

226
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:49,309
Why can't it be you?

227
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,229
Why me?

228
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:55,232
Do I have to repeat that I can't come so I don't have sperm for her?

229
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:56,513
How many times do you want me to say it, man?

230
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,998
Army, please.

231
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:05,570
Help me out.

232
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,220
Please?

233
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,509
I just want to enjoy sex again.

234
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:13,309
You know I'm currently working on solving everyone's problems.

235
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:16,909
And I believe this is exactly what Nim's puzzle is all about.

236
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:23,953
Forget it, Alex.

237
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,309
Let's leave.

238
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,300
I've been thinking about it and...

239
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,934
I realised I don't want anything to do with a bully.

240
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,707
Let's go. We'll just ask Ew.

241
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,737
Nim, you hold it right there.

242
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:38,509
Army.

243
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,910
If you agree to help Nim out,

244
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,854
I...

245
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:44,510
will do everything for you, buddy.

246
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,909
Whatever it is you want, just tell me.

247
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:49,309
You want me to find you a guy?

248
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,583
You want me to...

249
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,734
be your lookout for when you're... doing it in the car?

250
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,595
Whatever it is.

251
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:57,710
You name it.

252
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,821
But...

253
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,383
I don't have to be your husband, do I, Nim?

254
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:09,709
You probably already know, but someone like you is not my type at all.

255
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:15,158
I'm leaning more towards athletic guys with some muscles, you see.

256
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:19,309
One more thing, is it not a problem for you that I'm gay?

257
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:22,910
Why would it be?

258
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,937
It's not like I'm marrying you for life.

259
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,909
I'm just borrowing your stuff to make a baby.

260
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:30,781
Alright?

261
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,909
Are you sure he's actually smart?

262
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,109
You clearly pick the wrong guy.

263
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,978
Come on, Lex.

264
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:37,568
Oh, you.

265
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,069
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

266
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,405
You two need to calm down.

267
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:46,909
Nim, I think Army will be a good father to your kid.

268
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,143
He might run his mouth a little bit,

269
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:51,610
on top of being slutty, that is,

270
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,610
but I can guarantee you

271
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,909
he will be a great prototype for your baby.

272
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,309
Come on, Army.

273
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:13,309
Just think of this as a... double charity.

274
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,492
You get to help me. You get to help her.

275
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:18,734
I can finally come and Nim can finally have a baby.

276
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:26,492
Fine!

277
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,627
Alright!

278
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:28,909
I'll do it.

279
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:31,309
Everything is freaking possible now, I guess.

280
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:32,375
So screw it.

281
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,162
Army!

282
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,309
I freaking love you, my man.

283
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:39,709
Nim.

284
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:41,691
You'll finally be the perfect mum!

285
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,636
Enough already.

286
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,509
I love you so much, bastard.

287
00:14:53,636 --> 00:15:01,309
(I won't be able to see you tonight. I'm still at work.)
(My boss needs me to work overtime. I'll stay at my condo tonight.)

288
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,709
(Don't play games so much that you forget dinner, alright?)

289
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:36,012
Thank you for watching.

290
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:39,709
But like I said, it gets lonely playing all by myself.

291
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,214
I want someone to join me.

292
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,727
I want a pet I can play with.

293
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:47,756
If you're interested in a collab, or just wanna be my puppy,

294
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:49,088
get in touch with me.

295
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:51,709
Don't leave Blossom hanging.

296
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,338
I'll be waiting for you.

297
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:31,309
Listen.

298
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:36,109
Say, I have a question.

299
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,509
This is all hypothetical, by the way.

300
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,321
It's not about me.

301
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:42,004
I'm just asking hypothetically here—

302
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:43,841
What are you, a scratched record?

303
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,140
Why do you keep repeating that?

304
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,934
Say, there's this one guy who already has a girlfriend

305
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:52,909
but he has fun with another girl by...

306
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:59,535
playing games, or doing some sort of activities.

307
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,309
Not sex-related, of course.

308
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:04,331
It's... well... It's not sex.

309
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,921
But it does...

310
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:10,909
thrill him,

311
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,309
arouse him,

312
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:14,987
excite him.

313
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:16,910
Would you say that's cheating?

314
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,898
What the hell are you talking about, Ew?

315
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:22,138
Just be straightforward, man.

316
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,033
You're speaking in riddles or something?

317
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,750
And what the hell kind of "activities" did you mean?

318
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,112
It's not sex but it's... arousing, thrilling, and exciting?

319
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:33,498
Are you asking them to go skydiving?

320
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,909
No, bastard.

321
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,309
I mean, you know...

322
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,109
Dressing up and playing together.

323
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,109
That's it. It's nothing.

324
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:48,687
Are you talking about that puppy play thing?

325
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,709
You're gonna do it with another girl?

326
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:54,698
Dude, that's cheating.

327
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,935
It's just like sex.

328
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:57,709
It's not sex, dude. Listen to me.

329
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,109
There's no kissing.

330
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,309
There's no penetration.

331
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,550
Which part of that is cheating?

332
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,898
You say that as if you're just going to play board games with her.

333
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:08,510
This is risky territory, man.

334
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,916
It's kinky stuff, of course it's going to be

335
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:13,698
lumped in with sexual activities.

336
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,710
I don't know what you're planning,

337
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,109
but I think you should be careful.

338
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,709
You're being arrested wearing that getup in the Polaroid, you know.

339
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:22,909
I'm worried about you.

340
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,512
You're not worried about me.

341
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:30,110
I'm not your best friend.

342
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:32,510
Your best buddy is Army, isn't it?

343
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,909
Ew, don't say that.

344
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:40,325
You never think of me as a friend anyway.

345
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,312
Hey, Ice.

346
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:56,644
How you doing?

347
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:59,327
I brought some friends to see you play.

348
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,839
Are you playing soon?

349
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,509
Why are you here?

350
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:05,535
Just go back to your posh bars or whatever.

351
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,855
What you nagging me for?

352
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,909
I'm here to support you, you know.

353
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,309
I'm worried about you, Ice.

354
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,109
What? Let me play the big brother part for once.

355
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,509
How are things with Kim?

356
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:22,879
It's alright.

357
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,309
We haven't met much lately since she's working.

358
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,731
Her period's a bit late...

359
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,509
I'm afraid she might be pregnant.

360
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,109
Didn't you...

361
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,229
Didn't you use condoms?

362
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,124
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

363
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:44,509
We've been together many years, you know.

364
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,513
She's usually on birth control pills.

365
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:48,756
Well...

366
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:50,715
I don't know.

367
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,909
Maybe she's just not taking good care of herself recently.

368
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,854
Well, don't panic yet.

369
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:01,309
It might be nothing.

370
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:06,109
But if you want to be sure, tell Kim to come see me.

371
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:09,030
If it comes to the worst case scenario and you need help with anything,

372
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,383
I'm always here to hear you out.

373
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,109
I'll help you with anything.

374
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:15,709
Okay, then.

375
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,867
But let's not think about it tonight.

376
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,812
Just show your rock moves, man.

377
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,407
Go get it, rockstar.

378
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,109
Go!

379
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,109
You seem strange today.

380
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,709
It's a special dinner with my special someone.

381
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,535
How is that strange?

382
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,210
Well then...

383
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,121
Wanna come to my place later?

384
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,371
Kat.

385
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,309
I'm serious about you.

386
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,909
We've seen each other for months.

387
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:25,934
We've flown together even longer.

388
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,538
We've been through many things.

389
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:34,909
And we've had so much fun together.

390
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,907
What is all this prelude for?

391
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:45,709
Just tell me what you want.

392
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,932
I don't want you to be sex buddies with anyone else.

393
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:55,932
Why don't we just try dating seriously?

394
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:01,290
I promise I'll only have eyes for you.

395
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,512
No one else.

396
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,309
Be my girlfriend.

397
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,509
I'm not ready.

398
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,309
You don't have to give me an answer right now.

399
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:51,709
I know I'm putting a lot of pressure on you.

400
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,552
Maybe you're just being too surprised to think.

401
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:54,784
Right?

402
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,509
No.

403
00:22:58,174 --> 00:22:59,181
I'm not ready.

404
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:01,309
And you don't have to do all this.

405
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:03,709
People can change, Kat.

406
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,309
But why do I have to change myself for you?

407
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:14,509
Thank you for the dinner.

408
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,312
Kat.

409
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,724
Damn it.

410
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,442
It's damn hot.

411
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,021
I can't do this.

412
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:28,787
Exhausted?

413
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,109
I can't.

414
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:31,974
So you're tired?

415
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,710
Here. Drink it.

416
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:38,509
Thank you, Mr. Joe.

417
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:43,309
I think my free kicks used to be more on point when I was younger.

418
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,709
Right now? Not so much.

419
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,109
Not at all.

420
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,509
You're still very good at this.

421
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,909
I didn't think you'd become a doctor, you know.

422
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,026
Look at me.

423
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,507
I lose to you at football,

424
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,909
but I've become a football coach.

425
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,405
That's life, huh?

426
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,909
Nothing is ever certain.

427
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:09,709
But I'm glad we start seeing each other again.

428
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,737
See each other?

429
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:14,127
What are you talking about?

430
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:15,494
We're not seeing each other.

431
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:16,909
You're just a buddy I play football with.

432
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,516
Am I?

433
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,217
Yeah.

434
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,020
Really?

435
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,722
Yeah.

436
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:21,897
Really?

437
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,109
You sure?

438
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:27,709
Well...

439
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:30,109
Wanna come play football at my place tonight?

440
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:38,509
What the hell?

441
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:43,309
I just want to do something serious for once.

442
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,709
Oh?

443
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,864
So what we did at the locker room

444
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:49,312
or under the showerhead

445
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:51,303
wasn't serious?

446
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:53,614
No, that was just something casual.

447
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,138
I want you to give me everything.

448
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,232
More.

449
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,975
Harder. I'm so close.

450
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:18,578
A little more.

451
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,156
Faster.

452
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:44,509
Hey.

453
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,909
Did you come?

454
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:51,038
It's alright.

455
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,109
Want me to do it for you?

456
00:26:54,732 --> 00:26:56,353
No, don't.

457
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:57,177
Why not?

458
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:58,909
You don't need to.

459
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,309
Are you alright?

460
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,827
I am.

461
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,309
I'm just tired.

462
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,565
Maybe... you want me to top?

463
00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:12,841
I don't mind either way.

464
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:13,168
Alright?

465
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:13,974
I'll help you out.

466
00:27:13,974 --> 00:27:15,164
So you can come, too.

467
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,328
You don't need to.

468
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:18,109
That's not my problem.

469
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:19,839
Then what is?

470
00:27:20,824 --> 00:27:25,045
You don't need to be embarrassed if you want to bottom.

471
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:27,709
It doesn't make you any less of a man, you know.

472
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:34,332
Oh?

473
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,509
Hey, seriously.

474
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,309
Or...

475
00:27:43,476 --> 00:27:46,910
Are you actually a bottom, but you're too embarrassed to tell me?

476
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,109
Hey.

477
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:50,033
This is extremely normal.

478
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:52,909
You ever see some big muscular guy?

479
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,309
He can be a bottom.

480
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,709
And small guys can top.

481
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:02,509
What position you take has nothing to do with how your body looks.

482
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,909
It depends on what you enjoy.

483
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:07,861
Listen.

484
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:09,709
This has nothing to do with being a top or a bottom.

485
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,109
I just don't enjoy it.

486
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:14,509
What don't you enjoy?

487
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,709
Tell me.

488
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,521
We can work it out.

489
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:20,509
Tell me, please.

490
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,435
Please?

491
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,310
You wouldn't understand.

492
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,909
One more thing, you and I aren't dating.

493
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:31,932
I don't think we need to work anything out.

494
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:53,957
As you saw in the script, there are many

495
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,490
fight scenes for the main characters.

496
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,930
So I want you two to practise the fight sequences and train here.

497
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,402
This place specialises in training so don't worry at all.

498
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:05,651
They even train some crew from Hollywood working in Thailand.

499
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:09,709
Is there a chance I might get a big break in Hollywood?

500
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:12,109
You just might, with me as a director.

501
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,709
Mollie, is everything alright?

502
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:24,109
I'm alright.

503
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,309
It's nothing.

504
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:28,402
Are you sure?

505
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,110
Is something the matter?

506
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,916
It's just...

507
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:34,910
This is my ex-girlfriend's boxing gym.

508
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:37,309
Oh.

509
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,374
I didn't know that. Someone recommended this place.

510
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:41,778
How about we change venues? Let's leave.

511
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:42,949
Wait. No.

512
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,347
It's fine.

513
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,347
I'm okay. I'm a professional.

514
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:49,247
And it was forever ago.

515
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,509
We can be friends now.

516
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:00,107
Good.

517
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:02,510
Nice.

518
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,709
Did you snap a shot?

519
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,109
What are you, my stalking hater?

520
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,186
Just wanted a shot of a big talker.

521
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:23,710
Remind me again who said he's gonna

522
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,709
train like Chris Evans' Captain America?

523
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,084
The way you look right now,

524
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:29,561
you might have a shot at playing him, pre-serum.

525
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,509
That was harsh.

526
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:34,909
If you said that...

527
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,568
Guess I have to train a hundredth time harder.

528
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,100
I was joking.

529
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,510
Sit down.

530
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,205
I was just joking.

531
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,522
Just go at your own pace.

532
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:44,083
I'm not all that serious about the action scenes.

533
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,733
I just want it to look realistic.

534
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:47,531
Okay, then.

535
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:50,509
I want the best for your film, Jean.

536
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:52,909
I want it to be something of ours.

537
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,509
I mean all of us...

538
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,909
The cast and the crew.

539
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:12,109
Thank you.

540
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,706
I promise I won't let you down.

541
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,512
I trust you, Jean.

542
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:31,309
Well, I'd better get back to training.

543
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,909
Anything for our film, right?

544
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:44,509
Okay.

545
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:46,330
Hold on a sec.

546
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,947
Excuse me.

547
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,530
Aim straight.

548
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,450
Hey.

549
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,107
Just touch me if you have to.

550
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,310
I don't mind.

551
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:56,759
Okay, then.

552
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,612
Well, let's try again.

553
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,109
Punch straight, like this.

554
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:01,309
Aim for the punching bag.

555
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,255
Okay.

556
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,124
Alright?

557
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:04,171
Let's try it.

558
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:06,084
Nice. Keep your arm straight.

559
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,309
Try again.

560
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:12,109
Okay.

561
00:32:13,952 --> 00:32:14,826
Was that alright?

562
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:15,710
Yep.

563
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:23,749
Who'd have thought

564
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:27,709
that you'd be a lead actor in a film when you're grown up?

565
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:29,436
What does that mean?

566
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,227
Am I not pretty enough for the role?

567
00:32:31,227 --> 00:32:32,510
No way.

568
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:36,725
It's just that back then you didn't look as confident as you are now.

569
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:39,134
Yeah.

570
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:43,223
When someone's been underestimated and discriminated long enough,

571
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:44,512
they finally fight back.

572
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,824
Now if someone has something to say about me...

573
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:52,904
I'll kick their ass.

574
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,398
Like this.

575
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:56,510
Okay.

576
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,652
I get it.

577
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,109
No one will dare mess with you now.

578
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:06,709
Where's your girlfriend?

579
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:08,509
What's her name again?

580
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,427
Her name's Bew.

581
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:13,307
Bew, huh?

582
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,331
Have a thing for older women, don't you?

583
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:18,331
It's nice.

584
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,901
She seems nice.

585
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,709
You look good together.

586
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:26,512
You know what?

587
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:32,507
Liking older women always brings me trouble.

588
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:34,909
Hey.

589
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,109
Does that include me?

590
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:39,017
No, of course not.

591
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:40,909
I'm talking about myself.

592
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,509
You know, Bew wants a child.

593
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,909
So she asked me to get pregnant for her sake.

594
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,509
Actually, I just went through the IVF procedure.

595
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,436
Crap...

596
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,309
Are you serious?

597
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,509
You? Have kids?

598
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,109
You must really love her to do that for her.

599
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:06,109
Enough about me.

600
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,509
Right now...

601
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:13,838
Let's focus on training the world-renowned film star.

602
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,338
Let's get back at it.

603
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,519
Laika?

604
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,660
Yes.

605
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,832
My real name is—

606
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:00,795
No need.

607
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,356
We don't need to know each other's real names.

608
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:03,710
Just to be safe.

609
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:06,109
Of course.

610
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,709
Come on in.

611
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:22,910
Try barking.

612
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:28,910
Louder.

613
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,131
Go get changed in the bathroom then come out and play.

614
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:39,707
I'll have the camera ready.

615
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,109
Yes.

616
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,562
Screw it.

617
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:24,112
We're here.

618
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,937
Might as well go all the way.

619
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,258
Hello, everyone.

620
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:40,850
My dear fans who stick around...

621
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,109
(She's here.)
My dear fans who stick around...

622
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:42,427
(She's here.)

623
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:43,060
Blossom finally got a dog, y'all.
(She's here.)

624
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,709
Blossom finally got a dog, y'all.

625
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:48,109
Come here, Laika.

626
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,153
(Laikaaaaaa)

627
00:36:51,156 --> 00:36:52,879
Laika, say hello to the audience.

628
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,248
Good job.

629
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,912
Drink up.

630
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:15,223
Hey, Laika. You've made such a mess.

631
00:37:16,658 --> 00:37:19,309
Bad dog. You need to be punished.

632
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:22,909
I told you to be careful.

633
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:32,412
Bad dog.

634
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:33,710
Don't do it again.

635
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:44,972
How did you get in here?

636
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:48,109
We have an arrest warrant for publication of pornography.

637
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:49,992
We've been keeping an eye on you.

638
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:52,087
You won't get away in that getup.

639
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,109
Hang on. I didn't do anything wrong.

640
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:55,568
We'll discuss it at the station.

641
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:57,546
Sergeant, take the dog.

642
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:58,731
- No. No, wait. - Officer—

643
00:37:59,178 --> 00:37:59,585
Come.

644
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,958
- I didn't do anything. Listen. - I didn't do anything wrong.

645
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:02,746
Come.

646
00:38:02,903 --> 00:38:03,707
Come.

647
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,112
No photos!

648
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,815
(Interrogation Room)

649
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,330
Are you aware that it is illegal to produce pornography?

650
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,309
Are you aware that it is illegal to produce pornography?

651
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:15,427
I am.

652
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,589
I just don't see why it should be.

653
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,509
I help people relax and be happy.

654
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:22,823
It's not like I make them pay for my service.

655
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:25,737
And this is my body. Why don't I have a right to use it to earn money?

656
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,131
Aren't you ashamed?

657
00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:29,266
What would your parents say?

658
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,509
If you have a child one day, what would they say?

659
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:34,698
This will be on the internet forever.

660
00:38:34,698 --> 00:38:35,855
I'm not ashamed.

661
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,934
I became independent from home long ago.

662
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,781
I bought my parents a car with the money I make from this job.

663
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:42,109
And I don't want kids.

664
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,438
But even if I were to have one,

665
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:45,736
I'd be able to explain to them what this is.

666
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,909
It's not difficult.

667
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,349
What about you?

668
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,572
Can you speak?

669
00:38:51,572 --> 00:38:52,909
Or do you only know how to bark?

670
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:54,909
Do you need a dog interpreter?

671
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:56,510
Excuse me, officer.

672
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:00,639
Is my sexual practice in any way illegal?

673
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:04,909
The one who needs an interpreter because he only knows how to bark

674
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,509
isn't me.

675
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,737
Officer, I am here to bail my friend out.

676
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:19,307
Thank you, man.

677
00:39:19,935 --> 00:39:21,709
I really didn't know who else to call.

678
00:39:21,952 --> 00:39:24,109
You and Nim are the only ones who know about this.

679
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,943
It's alright. I get it.

680
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:28,907
But you do know you're on the news?

681
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:33,232
The photo they put on the news looks exactly like the Polaroid.

682
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,909
Crap. That's true.

683
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:38,509
Did it solve the puzzle, then?

684
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:43,060
Bailing you out doesn't seem to solve it.

685
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,004
It can't be that easy, can it?

686
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:44,888
It can be, though.

687
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:45,709
This might be right.

688
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,455
Let's talk about you.

689
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:53,233
You knew the Polaroids have every possibility to come true,

690
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:54,740
and you did it anyway?

691
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,303
I don't mind at all about your sexual practices and whatnot.

692
00:39:57,303 --> 00:40:00,272
You can enjoy your puppy, kitty, froggy, gecko,

693
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,531
lizard, bat, millipede or whatever play.

694
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:04,909
But you have to think about Liu.

695
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:08,033
I know.

696
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,338
I know I was wrong.

697
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,509
I let my needs control me.

698
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:16,909
Damn it.

699
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,839
What should I do?

700
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,709
Please, Lord.

701
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:24,107
Please let Liu be so busy she didn't see the news.

702
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,707
Ew.

703
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,109
Liu.

704
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:41,876
Babe.

705
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,307
Babe– Liu.

706
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,509
Liu, listen to me.

707
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:46,909
You can't just run away from me.

708
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,109
Why not?

709
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:49,681
You cheated on me.

710
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,141
I didn't cheat on you.

711
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:53,641
That woman and I didn't do anything.

712
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,309
We were just playing.

713
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,509
We didn't do it.

714
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:57,445
We didn't have sex.

715
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:58,907
Babe, you know this.

716
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:00,109
You were just playing?

717
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,469
How the hell could you just say that?

718
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,140
If you were just playing, why did you hide it from me?

719
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:10,909
It doesn't matter, does it?

720
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,935
Your heart is already with someone else.

721
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:15,801
That's not true, Liu.

722
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:18,109
Babe. Babe, listen to me.

723
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:19,935
That's not true.

724
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:21,709
I only have you.

725
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:25,312
I only love you.

726
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:28,909
You're the only one who understands me.

727
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,310
You're the only one who gave me a chance...

728
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:36,109
a chance at love for a good-for-nothing like me.

729
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,709
Don't leave me, Liu.

730
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:40,910
Please.

731
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:43,255
Don't leave me.

732
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:44,355
Babe.

733
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,990
Please. Don't leave me, Liu.

734
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:46,887
Liu.

735
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:47,718
Liu, no.

736
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,242
Liu.

737
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,094
Let go.

738
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:49,961
Babe.

739
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,017
Babe.

740
00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:52,451
See-ew, let go of me.

741
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:53,374
Babe.

742
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:54,706
Get up.

743
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:57,132
You're not a dog.

744
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:58,909
Get up!

745
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:07,310
Ew.

746
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,215
I think you...

747
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:13,309
You should find someone who shares your interest.

748
00:42:15,842 --> 00:42:18,109
I really think I can't be that girl for you.

749
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,135
No. No, babe.

750
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:25,309
I won't do it anymore. I will quit.

751
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,624
Whatever it is that you want, I'll be that for you.

752
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:30,107
I will be whatever you want me to be.

753
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:31,836
I will throw everything out.

754
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:34,383
All this stuff.

755
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,907
That's not what this is about!

756
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:45,707
That's not all this is about.

757
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:48,109
You never understand.

758
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:54,109
All this time, I was willing to be anything for you.

759
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,017
But you, you were never anything I wanted you to be.

760
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:58,909
Don't you get it?

761
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:01,312
Babe.

762
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,349
Babe.

763
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:05,692
Liu. Liu.

764
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:07,692
Liu!

765
00:43:58,131 --> 00:43:59,061
Kat, you bitch.

766
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:01,307
You love playing hard to get, huh?

767
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:23,300
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

768
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:25,728
I think I figure out whose chest it is

769
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:27,733
I'm sleeping on in that Polaroid of yours.

770
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:31,310
I won the green card lotto!

771
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:34,337
Hey, calm down, man.

772
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:37,309
Kim!

773
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,285
No matter what happens,

774
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:40,909
I'm always here with you.

775
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,239
No!

776
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:45,700
Don't come near me!

777
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:49,309
Why are you so nice to me, Alex?

778
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:51,710
How do you feel about me, Jean?
