1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,030
I can tell your heart is no longer with me.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,010
I think I should go.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,900
Ice...

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,410
I'm pregnant.

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,100
I will take care of you and our baby.

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,330
What do your feelings say about me, Jean?

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,640
I am gay.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,210
But I don't like gay sex.

9
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,790
The doing it part doesn't determine if someone is or isn't gay.

10
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,300
Something like this is all feelings.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,190
Kat.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,300
Finish him off.

13
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,520
Nothing can stop you from slaying.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,040
Just keep being your fabulous self.

15
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,420
I think you just solved my puzzle.

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,760
This place is mine.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,500
Order whatever you like.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,530
You're hot and generous.

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,310
I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,320
I have one.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,630
She just doesn't mind.

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,140
If you have no problem with that, then she doesn't, either.

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,500
What are you doing?

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm enjoying myself.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,680
Just like I'm sure you are.

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,090
Okay, then.

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,900
Wanna go home together?

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,100
Not sure.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,830
Let me see where this leads.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
Okay. Take care, then.

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,530
Don't worry. I always use protection.

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,310
We keep getting interrupted.

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,170
Let me go to the toilet real quick.

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,870
I'll be back.

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,910
Wait here.

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,530
What the heck is wrong with my dick?

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
Babe.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,630
I'm scared.

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,940
What if it doesn't work ever again?

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,310
That'll be a problem.

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Don't jump to conclusions.

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,750
Wait for Army's diagnosis.

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,500
It could be just a regular infection.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,510
You said that as if you're gonna use it so frequently.

45
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,330
Of course not. I'm just scared.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,610
Crap...

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,100
Patient, the doctor will see you now.

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,310
Can I stay, too?

Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

64
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,400
The blood test comes out negative.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,900
You don't have HIV.

66
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,500
But...

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,900
You have HPV.

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,100
What do you mean, HPV?

69
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,240
I thought that only happened in women?

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,900
It's infectious in men, too.

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,830
HPV is a virus that can cause

72
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,050
genital warts, anal cancer, oral cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer.

73
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,380
What causes it?

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,570
It is transmitted via sex.

75
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,420
The risk increases if you change your partner more often.

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,770
You should probably get tested, too, Rose.

77
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,500
You might have it.

78
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,070
Jedi.

79
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,380
You gave me STDs?

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,060
How can you blame me?

81
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,760
It could be from you.

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
You sleep around, too.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,020
But you also sleep around.

84
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,930
Tell me who you got it from.

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,160
Was it at that party?

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,180
Did you have an orgy?

87
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,300
That must be it.

88
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,890
Gross.

89
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,930
Babe, stop.

90
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,730
Stop!

91
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,780
That's not it.

92
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,530
It could be from you, you know?

93
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,050
You went to a party the other day, too.

94
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,300
No.

95
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,690
You banged someone else, didn't you?

96
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,430
I didn't do it.

97
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,270
Then who could I have gotten it from?

98
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,650
From your sleeping around, Jedi.

99
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,010
But you said this relationship is open.

100
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,930
Stop it.

101
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,220
C-Calm down, you guys.

102
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,800
Hey, hey, hey.

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,530
What are you guys doing?

104
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,810
Calm down.

105
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,810
This is a hospital, not a boxing ring.

106
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,750
But Jedi gave me HPV.

107
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,120
Can you stop freaking out?

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,090
You haven't even got tested yet.

109
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,060
You might not have it.

110
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,300
If I do have it, you're dead.

111
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,900
This is it.

112
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,300
This is exactly what I saw at the hospital.

113
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,430
These two have an HPV issue.

114
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,500
I need to help them both

115
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,700
so I can go back to the past.

116
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,100
How will you help?

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,500
It's Jedi who has it.

118
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,430
But you're specialised in female organs.

119
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,940
Rose is trans and never surgically transitions.

120
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,510
You can't help with that.

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Alex.

122
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,700
I think you've come to a deadend.

123
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,100
It can't be.

124
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,570
There must be something I can help them with.

125
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,040
They were arguing who first caught it.

126
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,540
I think I have to solve that puzzle.

127
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,700
Before you skip ahead to helping Jedi,

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,100
why don't you help your best friend first?

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,470
Liu already broke up with me,

130
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,910
and this crappy snapshot is still here.

131
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,300
If Liu and I don't get back together,

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,100
climaxing again will only be in your wildest dream.

133
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,900
Crap.

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm pregnant.

135
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,900
What'll you do?

136
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,300
You broke up with Bew, didn't you?

137
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,050
I don't know, man.

138
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,900
I can't think of anything right now.

139
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,610
Hey.

140
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,500
Do you want to keep the baby?

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,830
I can help you raise it.

142
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,130
- I mean it.
- What's with you?

143
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,300
Shut your trap.

144
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600
Your only role in this was to give me the sperm.

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,300
But I'm the father.

146
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,150
Oh, jerk.

147
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,710
You said you didn't care about that.

148
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,100
You said you had enough loads to give away for free.

149
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,700
No, I didn't think you would actually conceive.

150
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,300
But to think I'd actually be a father...

151
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,900
I'm a little excited about that.

152
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh, crap. Give it a rest.

153
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,900
I don't want to be your family.

154
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,900
Does that mean you won't keep the baby?

155
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,100
Just let us know what you want.

156
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,130
It's your body and it's your life.

157
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,900
Just think about it.

158
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,730
We're ready to help.

159
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,700
But for now

160
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
we all have our own mess to deal with.

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,300
(I promise that I will)

162
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,750
(Give you a good life, my child)

163
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,950
What is that?

164
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,500
That's some old man's bullcrap.

165
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,860
I was just making up some lyrics.

166
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,940
It's fine.

167
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,300
Hang on a sec. I'll be back.

168
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,370
Kim, why are you here?

169
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,280
This is no place for a pregnant woman.

170
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,500
Don't be so concerned.

171
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,910
- I'm already having a hard time.
- Hey, no drinking.

172
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,900
It's not good for the baby, you know?

173
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,450
Excuse me.

174
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,210
This is a no-smoking area.

175
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,200
Can you take it outside?

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
There aren't many people around.

177
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,500
Isn't it okay if I just do it here?

178
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,700
No, it's not.

179
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,090
The smoke gets into my girlfriend's face.

180
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,470
She can't breathe.

181
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,500
What does that have to do with me?

182
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,180
If your girlfriend doesn't like it, take her somewhere else.

183
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,300
Hey. I'm trying to be nice here.

184
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,300
If you're so worried about her,

185
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,510
just keep her at home.

186
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,420
Have her quarantined.

187
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,690
So not even germs touch her skin.

188
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,300
Hey. But this is not a smoking area.

189
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,210
Ice, enough.

190
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,430
It's fine.

191
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,220
Just let it go.

192
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,100
"It's fine"?

193
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,110
You're pregnant.

194
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,570
Did you hear what that jerkface said?

195
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,910
He was freaking insulting.

196
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,750
Oi, asshat. Did you call me a jerk?

197
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,070
Yeah, wanna freaking go?

198
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,300
Come at me, then.

199
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,770
Easy there, buddy.

200
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,650
Easy there.

201
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,510
I'm really sorry about my friend.

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,630
He's just drunk.

203
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,770
Sorry.

204
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,100
Sorry.

205
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,100
Kim, what's with you?

206
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,300
I was trying to protect you.

207
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,500
Well, don't.

208
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,300
I don't want it.

209
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,500
I can take care of myself.

210
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,930
Why are you mad at me?

211
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,180
Just tell me what's bothering you.

212
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,360
I don't want to be pregnant.

213
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,500
I don't want to have a baby.

214
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,900
I want an abortion.

215
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,130
Why?

216
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,500
Ice, I'm not ready.

217
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,080
I have no savings.

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,100
There's still so much I want to do with my life.

219
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,080
I don't know if I can give the baby the life it deserves if it's here.

220
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,780
What if I don't love it?

221
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,140
Kim.

222
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,290
If it's money you're worried about, don't be.

223
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,650
I will work.

224
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,730
I can take care of you and our baby.

225
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,700
Are you sure?

226
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,606
A child isn't just another

227
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,950
challenging project that you can drop whenever you want.

228
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,900
It's a life-long burden.

229
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,500
We're literally struggling to make ends meet.

230
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,500
You don't think I'll be a good father.

231
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,500
Ice.

232
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,500
I believe you will be.

233
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,500
Really.

234
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,300
Just not now.

235
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,700
Will you tell me now

236
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,100
who you work for?

237
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,180
Just kill me.

238
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,900
I won't ever tell you.

239
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,500
You think I don't have the gut to kill you

240
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,900
because I'm a woman?

241
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,500
I think you can do anything.

242
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,100
You just can't kill me.

243
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,870
Just admit it.

244
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,700
You only keep me tied up here

245
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,300
because you want to be close to me.

246
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:46,950
Okay.

247
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,680
Cut.

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,490
I'm so sorry.

249
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,170
It's alright.

250
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,550
Jean, it was my bad.

251
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,510
What happened? Did you get embarrassed?

252
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,290
It was just...

253
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,100
He...

254
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,290
Looking into his eyes just...

255
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,200
You know?

256
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,930
It's alright. I'll show you.

257
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,210
There's nothing complicated about this.

258
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,500
Okay.

259
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,700
Sure.

260
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,400
It's really nothing complicated, Mollie.

261
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,300
You grab his face.

262
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,500
Turn it your way.

263
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,500
You think I don't have the gut to kill you

264
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,900
beacuse I'm a woman?

265
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,300
You can't kill me.

266
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,700
You only keep me here

267
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,300
because you want to be close to me.

268
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,300
I asked you once before.

269
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,700
Will you answer me now?

270
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,230
So...

271
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,300
Can I make a move on you?

272
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,100
I guess you're taking over my role, Director?

273
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,080
Let's take twenty. I need some fresh air.

274
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,700
What's with her?

275
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,730
Why are you out here all alone?

276
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,900
I'm just thinking about this and that.

277
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,300
Really don't know what to do with my life right now.

278
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,480
Is this about your pregnancy?

279
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,530
I want an abortion.

280
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,069
But my boyfriend suddenly wants to be a father

281
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:52,924
even though he's not ready.

282
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,300
And...

283
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,090
I still want to have fun with life.

284
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,100
I have so many dreams.

285
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,700
I want to form a band.

286
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,100
I want to make a film score.

287
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,700
There are so many countries I haven't been to.

288
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,300
I just think I am not ready to have a baby.

289
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,130
What will you do?

290
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,100
Though I think you already have an answer to that.

291
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,700
Don't you think... I should take responsibility for my misstep?

292
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,480
You messed up.

293
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,370
Alright? It's already happened.

294
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,100
But it's still your life.

295
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,630
You have a right to make mistakes and start over.

296
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,900
It's all your choice.

297
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,880
You're in the first trimester.

298
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,130
It's legal to get an abortion.

299
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,570
If I really were to do it,

300
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,510
I wouldn't have the gut to tell my boyfriend.

301
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,500
He will definitely try to stop me.

302
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,900
But I also don't have the nerve to go alone.

303
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,900
How about this?

304
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,370
If you decide to go, come to me instead of your boyfriend.

305
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,010
But just sleep on it now.

306
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,010
Make sure you want what you're going to choose.

307
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,700
Once you have an answer, come to me.

308
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,760
I'll be by your side.

309
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,850
Okay?

310
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,300
Do you remember what I told you

311
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,700
about Kim's late period?

312
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,530
Yeah.

313
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,700
So... she's really pregnant?

314
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,100
I can read it from your face.

315
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,500
Kim wants an abortion.

316
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,810
I think the reason she doesn't want to keep the baby

317
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,140
is because she doesn't think I can take care of them.

318
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,700
But... I can.

319
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,910
I will.

320
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,090
I believe I can do it.

321
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,030
I can play more gigs.

322
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,710
I can take on more jobs.

323
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,900
I can manage and take responsibility for this.

324
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,330
Ice.

325
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,100
Slow down.

326
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,600
I think that maybe...

327
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,580
This isn't just about you.

328
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,230
And don't think it's because you're not great.

329
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,700
You're amazing.

330
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,730
You're just running after your dreams at the moment.

331
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,030
So is Kim.

332
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Ice.

333
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,700
I believe you can take care of the people you love.

334
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,310
But I think you need to keep in mind what she wants.

335
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,300
Kim is the one who has to carry the baby.

336
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,700
Think about what her body and mind will have to go through.

337
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,500
Kim is carrying something way heavier than you are.

338
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,700
But I want to take care of my own child.

339
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,700
Sometimes by taking responsibility,

340
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,300
you just need to respect her decision.

341
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,100
Ice.

342
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,330
I once made a mistake, too.

343
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,300
Though it wasn't knocking someone up.

344
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,100
But it... hurt all the same.

345
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,900
I guess I really didn't think it through.

346
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm happy you came to me.

347
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,900
You're all grown up now, man.

348
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,030
Come on.

349
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,500
It's alright. Don't overthink it.

350
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,440
You can always talk to me about anything.

351
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,130
Hey.

352
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,110
What are you doing here?

353
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,290
I'm here for maternity care.

354
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,100
Did you forget I'm pregnant?

355
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,300
Of course not.

356
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,130
Well...

357
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,900
What exactly will you do?

358
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,500
I don't know. I haven't decided.

359
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,900
You wanted a baby in the first place, right?

360
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,220
So keep it.

361
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,300
There's nothing to think about.

362
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,710
It wasn't me who wanted it.

363
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,100
The one who wanted it already left.

364
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,900
Nim.

365
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,510
I'm not trying to talk you into keeping the baby or anything, alright?

366
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,770
It's your life, after all.

367
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,320
It's your body.

368
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,700
I know I played a part in this, but...

369
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,730
Deep down I feel kinda happy that

370
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,700
I will get to be a father.

371
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,900
Why?

372
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,080
Why do you want to be a father?

373
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,100
I never wanted to before.

374
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,300
You get it, right?

375
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,900
It's just impossible between...

376
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,300
a man and a man.

377
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,700
I couldn't even bring myself to dream of it.

378
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,730
But suddenly there's a chance.

379
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,700
So I just want to grab it.

380
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,300
I think

381
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,480
I am really ready to take care of a child.

382
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,572
Don't you think it's cool that

383
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:28,924
this baby will have a gay dad and a lesbian mum?

384
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,960
Are you insane?

385
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,900
Aren't you afraid the baby will grow up with some trauma?

386
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,300
It's not like who we are is widely embraced by society.

387
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,280
I'm not afraid of that.

388
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,550
If it's my baby,

389
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,930
I'm sure it will grow up real strong.

390
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,870
And I'll teach it to shoot back at all the homophobic jerks.

391
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,090
Look at the mum and dad.

392
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,510
We're damn tough.

393
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,500
But well...

394
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,320
It's your decision.

395
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,300
Don't take my delusion into consideration.

396
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,700
Just choose what's right for you.

397
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,700
I'll let you know when I decide.

398
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,700
If you had wanted a baby,

399
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,110
what would you name it?

400
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,500
Any names that have nothing to do with you sound nice.

401
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,530
Your name's Nim. My name's Army...

402
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,050
What about Im?

403
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,910
I said I don't want your name in any of it.

404
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,010
Baby Im.

405
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,310
How's that sound?

406
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,030
Just wait and see.

407
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,900
I'll bang everyone.

408
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,380
If she can do it,

409
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,700
I can do it.

410
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,300
'Course you can, but think about it, man.

411
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,030
Excuse me.

412
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,310
You're so pretty.

413
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,130
In this whole place,

414
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,530
you're the prettiest girl.

415
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,300
Wanna come home with me?

416
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,120
I have a car out there.

417
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,570
What the hell did you just say?

418
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,380
I'm just hitting on her. What's it to you?

419
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,500
You are, huh?

420
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,390
Jerk.

421
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,910
Oh, sir, hold it.

422
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,690
Hold it.

423
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,750
Let's take it easy there.

424
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,830
Please, sir.

425
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,610
Just calm down.

426
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,530
My friend here is really drunk.

427
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,910
He's just had a fight with his girlfriend.

428
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,110
She was cheating on him so he just wants to get back at her.

429
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,300
But trust me when I say he didn't mean what he just said.

430
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
I beg you.

431
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,700
Don't hurt him.

432
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,500
Well, keep your friend's mouth shut next time.

433
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,750
What's with you?

434
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,430
Why're you afraid of him?

435
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,700
This is my place.

436
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,450
- This has nothing to do with that.
- Why'd you bow to him like that?

437
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,740
Just sit down.

438
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,710
Good job.

439
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,670
That jerk doesn't even know I own the damn place.

440
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,510
Calm down, pal.

441
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,900
That hurts.

442
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,160
I got it the first time you slapped me.

443
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,310
Good to hear, then.

444
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,910
Saying that to him, you wanna die before your time comes?

445
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,280
I just want to do what Rose did.

446
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,110
What did she do?

447
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,500
Sleeping with someone else?

448
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,900
But you're already doing that.

449
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,850
You have someone. So why can't she?

450
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,210
It's only fair, right?

451
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,650
You said it yourself that this would be an open relationship.

452
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,240
Open relationship, my foot.

453
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,530
I never sleep with anyone,

454
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,910
but her.

455
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,300
Wait.

456
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,300
Are you saying you got HPV from Rose?

457
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,530
But Army said it was common in people who often change partners.

458
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,040
I'll swear it on my life.

459
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,700
I never sleep with anyone else.

460
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,100
I just want to party with everyone.

461
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,130
Then who gave you HPV?

462
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,100
That's the question you doctors have to answer me.

463
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,500
How the hell would I know that, you dork?

464
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,100
Tough day?

465
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,550
Not more than usual.

466
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,100
Why are you here?

467
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,180
I told you not to come see me here.

468
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,710
I'll go to you.

469
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,900
Joe, listen.

470
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,300
I...

471
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,900
I'm going to be a father.

472
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,860
What are you talking about?

473
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,910
Are you daydreaming?

474
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,030
I'm not.

475
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,300
I'll tell you later.

476
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,700
But you see, if I'm a father...

477
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,220
That makes you a father, too.

478
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,700
Got it, Dad?

479
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,110
What are you doing?

480
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,890
You can't.

481
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,510
Someone will see us.

482
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,700
So what?

483
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,700
They'll know your boyfriend is a freaking cool and handsome doctor.

484
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,970
Don't be ridiculous.

485
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,360
You and I aren't dating.

486
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,900
Yeah, well, I am asking us to.

487
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm waiting for the right moment with the right vibe.

488
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,900
I'll ask you to go out with me.

489
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,930
Or...

490
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,160
I know.

491
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,500
I'll do it now.

492
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,100
Will you marry me?

493
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,100
I love Joe. I want to be his boyfriend.

494
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,350
Go out with me!

495
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,950
- Will you go out with me?
- Army.

496
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,020
I want to be your boyfriend.

497
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,690
Army!

498
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,550
I love you so much.

499
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,000
Army.

500
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,140
- I mean it.
- Army, stop.

501
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,310
I really love him.

502
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,240
I've never loved anyone so much.

503
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,170
- I'm in love with Joe.
- Army, no.

504
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,560
Give me a hug.

505
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,300
I love Joe.

506
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,500
No.

507
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,850
Stop.

508
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,910
But I love you.

509
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,970
But you can't do it here.

510
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,500
I want to be Joe's boyfriend.

511
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,180
- No.
- But he won't say yes.

512
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,300
I love Joe.

513
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,910
Oh, Mollie.

514
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,320
What was that for?

515
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,500
What is it?

516
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,530
Congrats on being a single mum.

517
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
Thank you.

518
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,830
It's for your health.

519
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,900
I want the baby to come out as strong as the mother.

520
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,830
Thanks.

521
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,550
There are still so many months to go.

522
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,300
I'm preparing my body and mind for it.

523
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,700
Just let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

524
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,100
You're gonna help me raise it?

525
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,350
I don't mind, you know.

526
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,900
I like kids.

527
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,300
And kids adore me.

528
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,410
Kids adore you?

529
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,300
What kids?

530
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,100
No.

531
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,270
Here.

532
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,080
Aim right.

533
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,420
Left and right, yeah.

534
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,300
You're getting so good at this you could be in Black Widow.

535
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,700
You jest, surely.

536
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,930
You know what?

537
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,850
Bew didn't only break up with me

538
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,930
because she wanted to go to America.

539
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,300
What else was it about?

540
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,300
She saw me talking to you.

541
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,330
She thought I'm still in love with you.

542
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,530
I was the reason you guys broke up?

543
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,910
That's not what I mean.

544
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,130
We had other issues.

545
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,900
She just used you as an excuse to cut ties.

546
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,700
But is what she said

547
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,910
actually true?

548
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,500
Are you still in love with me?

549
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,910
I don't know.

550
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,100
But to say that I'm not feeling anything

551
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,500
would be a lie.

552
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,900
When I look at you,

553
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm always reminded of the past.

554
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,300
If you ask me if I still love you...

555
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,900
I always have.

556
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,980
But I was just a foolish kid back then.

557
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,700
Now that I think about it, it was a shame to let you go.

558
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,630
Nothing is ever too late, you know?

559
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,360
Hello, Mr. Alex.

560
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,430
Welcome to Kitty Airline.

561
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,660
I'm Kataleeya, the one and only flight attendant of this airline.

562
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,880
Please buckle your seatbelt.

563
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,310
I'll be with your breakfast shortly.

564
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,480
This is homemade, by the way.

565
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,930
Enjoy your meal. Thank you.

566
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,930
Tea, coffee, or me?

567
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,900
Or orange juice?

568
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Why are you here?

569
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,600
I want to take care of you.

570
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,300
As thanks for taking care of me all this time.

571
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,810
I came in to make breakfast with the keycard you gave me the other day.

572
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,450
You didn't have to.

573
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,100
I don't want anything in return.

574
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,100
I just went to see Jedi.

575
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,700
He was a mess.

576
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,950
He and Rose are fighting.

577
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,480
And he took it out on the customers in his bar.

578
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,500
He told me Rose slept with someone else and gave him HPV.

579
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,860
I don't think so.

580
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,985
Rose told me she hasn't

581
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,570
slept with any other guys ever since dating Jedi.

582
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,100
At best she would just toy with them.

583
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,510
It was Jedi who gave it to Rose.

584
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,280
Really?

585
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,500
But Jedi swears he never sleeps with anyone else.

586
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,470
If they're both denying it,

587
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,300
who do we believe?

588
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,300
Think later. Let's eat.

589
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,370
Is it good?

590
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,700
It's really good.

591
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,100
Alex.

592
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,690
Yes?

593
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,700
Can I ask you something?

594
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,100
Well...

595
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,290
The two of us...

596
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,900
Is there a chance that we could have what Rose and Jedi have?

597
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,710
What did you just say?

598
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,060
Do you have HPV?

599
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,930
Who gave it to you?

600
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,810
Me?

601
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,790
- No.
- How are you feeling?

602
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,100
No, I don't have it.

603
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,700
Then what did you mean?

604
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,500
Well, what I'm trying to say is...

605
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,570
Is there a chance

606
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,230
that you and I will date,

607
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,330
or go steady as actual lovers like them?

608
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,100
Why do you suddenly want to go out with me?

609
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,900
You never wanted a relationship before.

610
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,900
I guess I... don't feel safe?

611
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,500
I just want to have somebody.

612
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,100
And you're the person I trust the most, Alex.

613
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,300
If that's all you want,

614
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,540
we don't have to date.

615
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,100
I can take care of you as a friend.

616
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,700
You're not in love with me, Kat.

617
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,700
It's just that Captain made you feel so insecure.

618
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,300
So you feel like you need someone to take care of you and fulfil you.

619
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,140
But believe me.

620
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,100
You will be acing the single life.

621
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,900
Having a boyfriend isn't the answer.

622
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,700
Just continue living your life to the fullest as you always have.

623
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,900
Well...

624
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,500
A rejection with a shot of encouragement, huh?

625
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,110
Thanks.

626
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,830
Eat.

627
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,330
Did you take your meds?

628
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,500
The doctor told you to take your medicines and cut out smoking.

629
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,700
You'll get better soon.

630
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,230
I don't care if I don't.

631
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,600
I'll just cut it off.

632
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,450
Can you not be childish?

633
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,500
Army and Alex said this isn't all that fatal.

634
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Just take your meds and take care of yourself and you'll be fine.

635
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,900
How are your conditions?

636
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:03,870
Nothing major.

637
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,100
It's a little itchy, but it'll go away.

638
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,300
Do you still think I gave it to you?

639
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,700
What else should I think?

640
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,110
Ever since I started dating you, I've only ever done it with you.

641
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,170
What do you mean?

642
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,170
You said you slept with someone else.

643
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,300
I lied.

644
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,130
I couldn't do it.

645
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,100
No matter how open I want this relationship to be,

646
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,500
when the time comes...

647
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,900
All I could see is your face.

648
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,700
I get that you want to try it with someone else, someone more exciting.

649
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,530
We've been dating a long time, I know it gets boring.

650
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,300
So I agreed to it.

651
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,820
But...

652
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,300
I also didn't sleep with anyone else.

653
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,690
But that time you said you...

654
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,300
I lied. I—

655
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,100
It wasn't the same without you.

656
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,370
I did want to do it with someone else.

657
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,100
But... when it's not your scent,

658
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,930
I just get turned off.

659
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,130
You like my scent, then?

660
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,100
I guess so.

661
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,130
I guess I could smell your love for me.

662
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,900
But where the hell did we get it from?

663
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,300
We both didn't sleep with anyone else.

664
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,900
I think Alex and Army will be able to give us an answer.

665
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,310
A photo?

666
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

667
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,510
Excuse me.

668
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,900
Do you want a photo?

669
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,100
No.

670
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,490
I was gonna ask if you need company.

671
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,500
You're alone, right?

672
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,800
Sure.

673
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
Please.

674
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,710
You're an actor?

675
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,480
You could say that.

676
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,310
Sorry.

677
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,650
I'm not very familiar with this.

678
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,900
I don't read up on entertainment news.

679
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,300
It's alright.

680
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,130
I'm not that famous, to be honest.

681
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,100
Are you here alone?

682
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,720
Yes.

683
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,700
I just got my heart broken by some guy.

684
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,900
But I'm alright now.

685
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,150
I've moved on.

686
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,510
That's why I'm here talking to you.

687
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,300
Aren't you a bit forward?

688
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,380
We don't even know each other.

689
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,310
I'm Kat.

690
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,100
Tony.

691
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,700
Now we know.

692
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,300
So let's make a deal.

693
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,540
Wanna come home with me?

694
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,910
My place isn't too far from here.

695
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,500
Hold on.

696
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,900
You're a very pretty lady.

697
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,030
But I can't go home with you.

698
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,330
Why not?

699
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,100
You got a girlfriend?

700
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,500
I don't have one.

701
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,900
But I have someone I have my eye on.

702
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,700
Does it look like you might have a shot?

703
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,300
If not, I'm available, you know?

704
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,700
No relationship, though.

705
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,900
We'll just have fun.

706
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,700
I've never met a woman as straightforward as you.

707
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,360
What's the point of beating around the bush?

708
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,500
You seize what you want, right?

709
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,900
Okay, then.

710
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,110
I get it.

711
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,700
I respect that.

712
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,310
But I can't go home with you tonight.

713
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,700
Yeah.

714
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,910
I understand.

715
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,130
If you get rejected, and I'm still available, and we meet again...

716
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,900
let me know.

717
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,900
Not sure if, by the time that happens, I'll still want you, though.

718
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:06,060
Okay.

719
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,233
Alex told me all about you two.

720
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:13,095
In your case, I have to explain it like this.

721
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,912
HPV can happen in monogamous couples, too.

722
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,743
Before you started dating,

723
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,446
you guys didn't sleep with just one partner, right?

724
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:24,448
- No, we didn't.
- No, we didn't.

725
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:26,289
But don't worry.

726
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,162
This is treatable.

727
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:31,760
Not just women, men should get vaccinated against it, too.

728
00:41:32,963 --> 00:41:35,362
If you guys are thinking about doing it during this time,

729
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,614
do use a condom.

730
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:38,962
There are other diseases to be mindful of.

731
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,985
Don't worry.

732
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,963
You're lucky your conditions aren't severe.

733
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:48,562
I'll help you.

734
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:50,608
With me as your doctor, you'll be cured.

735
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,169
Good job, buddy.

736
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,834
You two, make up already, alright?

737
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:00,565
You don't need to fight.

738
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,853
You're head over heels in love.

739
00:42:01,878 --> 00:42:03,873
You're the most lovey-dovey in high school.

740
00:42:03,873 --> 00:42:06,562
You act like you don't care, but in the end,

741
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:08,291
you couldn't do it with someone else.

742
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,162
Both of you.

743
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:16,162
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

744
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,960
Well... It was my fault.

745
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:22,861
I should have known you better than this.

746
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:25,762
I knew you wouldn't cheat on me.

747
00:42:25,762 --> 00:42:26,708
I'm sorry, too.

748
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,791
I won't jump ahead and judge you again.

749
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:32,745
Then...

750
00:42:32,745 --> 00:42:34,568
Let's take care of each other from now on.

751
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,491
Of course.

752
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,391
But let's tone down the partying for a bit?

753
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,585
Yeah.

754
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,362
Get better before you go at it again.

755
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,990
Jean, thank you for coming with me.

756
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:13,188
It's alright.

757
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,963
I understand completely.

758
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,363
Are you sure you won't tell your boyfriend?

759
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:21,600
Yeah.

760
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,190
I don't think I will.

761
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:28,162
I've made up my mind.

762
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:31,303
If he wants to be mad at me or break up with me,

763
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:32,962
then there's nothing I can do.

764
00:43:34,057 --> 00:43:37,141
If he really loves me, he will respect my decision.

765
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:38,962
Right?

766
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,023
Kudos to your strength, sis.

767
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:44,338
Whatever happens,

768
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:46,162
this will pass.

769
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:50,500
Thank you.

770
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:52,885
Kim.

771
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:55,190
Kim.

772
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:02,962
Jean, this is my brother,

773
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,163
Alex.

774
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,134
Why didn't you tell me you'd come here?

775
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:11,363
I could have come with you.

776
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,390
You didn't want me to do it.

777
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:16,791
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

778
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:19,762
Don't ever think that.

779
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:24,024
I'm sorry I went ahead and be selfish and want a family

780
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:26,526
when I was nowhere near ready.

781
00:44:26,526 --> 00:44:28,885
I didn't even try to understand how you'd feel.

782
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:31,762
But I get it now.

783
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:35,969
I just want to let you know that no matter what happens,

784
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,387
I respect every decision you make

785
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:40,162
and I am always here for you.

786
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:56,962
Let's go see the doctor together.

787
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:02,876
Jean, you can go home if you want.

788
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:04,788
I'll stay with Ice.

789
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:06,562
I'm fine. I'll wait.

790
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:08,962
Thank you.

791
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,362
I'm going, then.

792
00:45:12,184 --> 00:45:13,188
Yeah.

793
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:56,965
How did you know Kim?

794
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,605
We work together.

795
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:03,605
She works with sound reports on set.

796
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:06,562
Small world, huh?

797
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:12,562
Oh, and...

798
00:46:12,777 --> 00:46:14,962
Before we got here,

799
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:16,790
what did you talk to Kim about?

800
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:24,562
Nothing.

801
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:26,391
She's a grown woman.

802
00:46:26,956 --> 00:46:29,991
All I have to do is to respect her decision.

803
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:35,985
I think what Kim needs right now is someone who'll support her.

804
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:38,962
Because what she's dealing with...

805
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:42,562
I can tell that

806
00:46:42,562 --> 00:46:44,962
it is very difficult for a woman to go through.

807
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:50,391
It's nice that she got to meet you.

808
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:53,362
You must be like her role model.

809
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,762
Role model?

810
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:59,362
My life is far messier than hers, I just hide it very well.

811
00:47:00,845 --> 00:47:02,962
You can talk to me about it, you know.

812
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:07,190
Forget it.

813
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,088
What did you say to your brother to persuade him to come here anyway?

814
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:18,562
I just told him that not everybody feels ready at the same time.

815
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:20,913
He might be ready to do it, but if the other party isn't,

816
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:22,162
it means they're not ready.

817
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,960
I might not know Kim well, but I understand that

818
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:30,562
she's following her dreams.

819
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,162
Carrying a baby for nine months just because

820
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:37,537
a guy said he'd take responsibility...

821
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:38,960
just isn't worth it.

822
00:47:40,646 --> 00:47:43,760
I told Ice to be more understanding of her

823
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:46,160
rather than only take himself into account.

824
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,763
So you actually know how to be nice.

825
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:52,162
Should have done it earlier, though.

826
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,191
What do you mean?

827
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,943
Don't ask me every little thing.

828
00:47:57,943 --> 00:47:59,987
I'll run away again if you do.

829
00:48:12,894 --> 00:48:14,040
Oh, how is your film—

830
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,491
What did I just say?

831
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:17,362
Just stand there and be quiet.

832
00:48:18,743 --> 00:48:20,385
Okay, then.

833
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:22,836
No more questions.

834
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:52,273
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

835
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:56,234
Are you sure it's really okay to let him touch you for some bonus?

836
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,671
Just do it for your career.

837
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,663
Do you think I'm just your sex toy?

838
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:02,197
Use a vibrator next time.

839
00:49:02,197 --> 00:49:03,680
It only needs batteries.

840
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,864
It's got no feelings.

841
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:06,360
If you want to keep being a coach here,

you need to keep your sexual orientation a secret.

843
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:12,560
But what you love is about to prevent you from living your life.

844
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:14,387
Don't be a coward.

845
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:16,162
I like Alex.

846
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:20,962
I want to ask you out, Jean.
