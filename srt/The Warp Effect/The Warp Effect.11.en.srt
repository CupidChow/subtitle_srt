1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,541
My girlfriend's here to work, not to be harassed by you!

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:06,897
I just want the kind of love that makes me feel at ease.

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:09,740
Marry me, Rose?

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,706
Use a vibrator next time.

5
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:13,168
That stuff only needs a battery.

6
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:14,349
It doesn't have feelings you can hurt.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,818
But right now, what you love

8
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,481
is about to stop you from actually living.

9
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,340
Don't be a coward.

10
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:20,676
I want to ask you out.

11
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,463
Before I can give you an answer,

12
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:24,033
there's something I need to prove first.

13
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,415
I can't be anything more than this with you, Tony.

14
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,021
Isn't this Mr. Saran?

15
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,768
Why is there a photo of Mum and Mr. Saran?

16
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:50,540
Why do you want to know what his connection to your mother is?

17
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,744
Why can't you tell me?

18
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,740
Are you keeping something from me, Dad?

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,340
You don't need to pay him any respect.

20
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,716
He left your mother before you were even born.

21
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,340
Saran...

22
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:16,940
is your biological father.

23
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,904
Your mother was an amazing person.

24
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:27,740
She got a scholarship to study medicine abroad.

25
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:31,341
She was dating Saran at the time.

26
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:36,766
I was her best friend

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,740
when we were in medical school.

28
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:43,340
The reason she was concerned about your sex life

29
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:46,940
was because she was afraid you'd end up like your biological father.

30
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,340
She was afraid you would get some woman pregnant.

31
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:53,563
It could ruin your and her bright future.

32
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,386
But why?

33
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:12,140
Why did you never tell me any of this?

34
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,281
Does it matter?

35
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:17,827
Do you really want to get to know

36
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,990
someone who hurt your mother like that?

37
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,752
But do you even realise that

38
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:27,740
my life is a mess right now because of Mum?

39
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:31,291
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,261
Your life is great.

41
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,740
Don't dig up the past.

42
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,669
Just live your life.

43
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,965
Let the past stay there.

44
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:53,649
Your mother wouldn't want you unearthing a buried past.

45
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,254
What?

46
00:02:57,254 --> 00:02:59,175
Are you saying, now that you know the truth,

47
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,527
you won't think of me as your father anymore?

48
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:10,940
You're my only father, Dad.

00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,578
Good class.

66
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:26,378
Goodbye, everyone.

67
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:27,738
Bye.

68
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:28,512
Bye.

69
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,601
Good day.

00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:39,738
Oh, Alex?

72
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,003
Why are you here?

73
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,464
I've missed you.

74
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,940
It's been a while. You look amazing.

75
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,485
Having a trip down memory lane?

76
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:49,469
No.

77
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,740
I'm here to talk to you.

78
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,940
So, what do you want to talk to me about?

79
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,541
About this.

80
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:12,138
Can you explain this?

81
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:20,538
Well?

82
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:24,140
I know you're my biological father.

83
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,540
My dad told me everything.

84
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:28,909
You knocked my mother up

85
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,809
and left her for my dad to take care of.

86
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,340
You were so concerned for me when I was a student here...

87
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,740
Were you just trying to make up for it?

88
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:43,341
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:46,940
I was very young.

90
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,541
I really wasn't ready.

91
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:55,340
So you were just gonna act like my father when you got older?

92
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,940
I'd been trying all this time.

93
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,343
Your mother always turned me down.

94
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:05,470
I tried sending you birthday presents every year.

95
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,063
But she never took it.

96
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:13,338
Presents?

97
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,740
You sent me birthday presents?

98
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:16,941
Yes.

99
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:20,540
But one year,

100
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,140
she finally accepted it.

101
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:30,306
But it never reached you because

102
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,540
your mother...

103
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,569
got in an accident.

104
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,368
But I still wanted to give you that gift

105
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,781
so I left it on your doorstep

106
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,168
when you were turning 18.

107
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:52,940
Was it an instant camera?

108
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,002
Yes.

109
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,140
Back then,

110
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:02,192
I loved photography.

111
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,740
And your mother

112
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,141
was my favourite model.

113
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:10,940
If she was still alive now,

114
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,540
I'd love to apologise from the bottom of my heart.

115
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:19,340
Same goes for you.

116
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,140
I don't need your apology.

117
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,940
The only person who could forgive you is her.

118
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,969
But she's no longer here.

119
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:37,340
So you can live with this guilt for the rest of your life.

120
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:40,941
Alex.

121
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:42,735
Alex, wait.

122
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:43,975
Alex.

123
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:08,946
Can I ask you something?

124
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,140
How many friends with benefits do you have?

125
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,958
Right now?

126
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,391
One.

127
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:15,937
Just you.

128
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,011
(THAT NIGHT)

129
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:30,349
I got you hooked, didn't I?

130
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,325
Ridiculous.

131
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,738
Of course not.

132
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,172
I just don't want to get tied down to anyone.

133
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:38,540
They all want to date eventually.

134
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:40,806
But not you.

135
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:43,340
You're not the romantic type or anything like that.

136
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,241
We screw.

137
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,196
We're done.

138
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:47,553
We go home.

139
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:50,538
That's only because I haven't shown you my romantic side.

140
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,940
If I do...

141
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:56,540
you might want me to ask you out right away.

142
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,140
No, thanks.

143
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,538
What if your fans find out about this and I get dragged?

144
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:06,765
I want to just be a nobody and live my life the way I always do.

145
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,855
Fine. Up to you, then.

146
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,340
Just come and go all your please.

147
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,614
But if you ever get lonely,

148
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:16,938
give me a call.

149
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,935
I don't want you to treat me like I'm just your bed buddy.

150
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,940
I can be anything, you know?

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,338
I can be your chauffeur,

152
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:28,943
your cook,

153
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,538
or your...

154
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,540
My what?

155
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,141
Your whatever.

156
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:44,042
You decide.

157
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:49,963
Then, can you be the...

158
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,940
room service for now?

159
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,846
I'm starving.

160
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,383
Let's order something.

161
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:57,738
Please?

162
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,174
Of course.

163
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:33,195
Didn't we finish your training?

164
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,269
Is something the matter?

165
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,965
Are you really going to be like this?

166
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,940
Are you really not going to open up to anyone?

167
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:43,710
You think you're so high and mighty,

168
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,740
think you really can raise a kid on your own?

169
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,962
I've put on a brave face to be here, you know?

170
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:54,140
Do you need me to spell it out for you that I'm still in love with you?

171
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,740
That I am so happy to get to spend time with you again?

172
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:07,340
We can spend time together as friends.

173
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:09,740
God, Nim.

174
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:12,765
Stop it.

175
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,740
What freaking friends?

176
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,140
We've never been friends.

177
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:24,140
When I put that sticker on you on Valentine's Day,

178
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,540
I didn't do it as a friend.

179
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,963
I don't know, Mollie.

180
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,140
I just think this won't work.

181
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,137
Oh?

182
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,338
Is that so?

183
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,940
Is that all you think of me?

184
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,366
I get it now.

185
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:55,340
I apologise, then.

186
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,740
The problem seems to lie with me.

187
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,919
What a damn fool I am.

188
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:08,540
Enjoy your life.

189
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:10,755
I won't bother you again.

190
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:12,138
It's not like that.

191
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,614
The reason it won't work is because of me.

192
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:24,752
I just want to live my life without having to care about someone else.

193
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,940
Okay, then.

194
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,340
Be my guest.

195
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,740
Enjoy your solo life.

196
00:12:58,863 --> 00:12:59,943
Holy crap.

197
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:02,057
Your life is more epic than a fantasy movie.

198
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,130
So the power in the camera

199
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:06,841
was born from your parents' love in the accident.

200
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,940
I still haven't solved the whole thing.

201
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,341
There's my photo and Jean's.

202
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,740
These two are still the same.

203
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,814
I think

204
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,269
you need to find a way to get closer to Jean.

205
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:25,338
Find out what makes her cry like she does in the photo.

206
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:30,138
I have a feeling that both of your photos could be about the same thing.

207
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:33,740
What do I have to do?

208
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:37,968
I think you need to try again.

209
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:40,941
But it has to be all-or-nothing this time.

210
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:42,835
What else can I do?

211
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,769
I went to see her at her workplace last time

212
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,940
and she slapped me right in the face.

213
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,940
Talking about having a life like a fantasy movie...

214
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:58,366
Jedi's wedding.

215
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,992
Ask her as your date to Jedi's wedding.

216
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,642
The theme is prom night.

217
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:08,541
So take this chance to win her over.

218
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,340
If you get her to kiss you,

219
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,738
the curse will go away.

220
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:19,340
Maybe you can orgasm again after that.

221
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,969
Oh, yeah.

222
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,144
But I think, if you're going after her again,

223
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:27,738
you might need to go big this time.

224
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:31,338
Fine.

225
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,740
I'll try asking her out.

226
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,140
But if she says no,

227
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,190
I'll go alone.

228
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,500
Go alone?

229
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,599
Army just broke up with his boyfriend.

230
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,747
I'm sure he can't find someone to go with him.

231
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,058
He'll be alone, too.

232
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,737
Hey, hey, hey.

233
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,737
As if someone of my calibre

234
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:50,312
would ever go to prom alone.

235
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,740
What will you do, then?

236
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,137
What? Take yourself out to the damn dance?

237
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:10,940
I guess you all have heard about me.

238
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:18,140
Your parents are afraid I would turn you into something like me.

239
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:21,740
Some of them even think I'd violate you.

240
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,483
But let me ask you honestly,

241
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:25,343
ever since I've become your coach,

242
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:27,740
have I ever made any of you feel uncomfortable?

243
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,940
No, sir.

244
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:33,409
Have I been a good coach who teaches you how to play football?

245
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:34,943
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:37,340
Does my liking men

247
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,691
compromise my ability to be your coach?

248
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,140
No, sir.

249
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:47,929
Then I guess it won't be a problem.

250
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,389
If you're feeling uncomfortable with this,

251
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:50,541
just come talk to me.

252
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,940
You can also quit the team, of course.

253
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,340
Because I don't think I can change who I am.

254
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:57,740
The only thing I can do is

255
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:01,338
promise you I'll do my best as your coach.

256
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,722
I'll turn you into a great football player

257
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:04,944
and send you to nationals.

258
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,340
I'll show you that

259
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,940
sexuality has nothing to do with footwork.

260
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:11,883
Alright?

261
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:13,340
Yes, sir.

262
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:17,569
Give it a go.

263
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,340
Can I join you, Coach?

264
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,042
What the hell are you doing here?

265
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,035
Don't you see I'm in the middle of teaching here?

266
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:50,540
I'm here to ask for another chance.

267
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,140
I'm sorry

268
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,541
for using my own standard to judge you.

269
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,267
You're not a coward.

270
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,143
You're just waiting for the right moment.

271
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,529
Yeah, okay.

272
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:15,741
Is that all?

273
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:16,940
Go back now.

274
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,340
Hold on. I'm not done.

275
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:20,876
Don't rush me off like that.

276
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,278
Just say what you're here to say.

277
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:23,387
Look.

278
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,340
My athletes are waiting to try out the penalty kicks.

279
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:30,769
Huh?

280
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:36,140
Will you go to prom with me?

281
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:40,941
Prom?

282
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:41,972
What prom?

283
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:43,645
We graduated ages ago.

284
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,198
No. It's...

285
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,563
Jedi is getting married.

286
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,540
The theme of the wedding is prom night.

287
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:54,140
You know, I...

288
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,968
I need a date for that.

289
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,143
So I thought I'd ask.

290
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:04,940
Will you go with me?

291
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,740
I don't want to go solo. That's too lonely.

292
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,143
If you want me to go with you,

293
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,540
I have an offer.

294
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:22,941
You have to play my game first.

295
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:24,140
Sure.

296
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,337
Tell me.

297
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,562
If you can kick the ball to hit the crossbar,

298
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:33,199
I'll go to prom with you.

299
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,409
Hold on.

300
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:35,758
Isn't that, like, impossible?

301
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:37,340
The crossbar?

302
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:39,740
You know I'm not easy to win over.

303
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:55,968
Fine.

304
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:00,140
Brush up your tuxedo.

305
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,140
Crap...

306
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,940
I have to go to prom alone?

307
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:54,909
I know.

308
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,541
I missed it.

309
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,368
Bye, then.

310
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,740
You're just gonna give up easily like that?

311
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,341
Huh?

312
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:08,540
What do you mean?

313
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:18,140
I'll give you another shot.

314
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,568
And hey...

315
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,540
Don't you dare miss this time.

316
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,140
Joe.

317
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,941
I won't miss.

318
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:18,140
Will you go to prom with me?

319
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:22,940
Okay.

320
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:52,681
Drink!

321
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:55,925
Drink for the past we should have forgotten!

322
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,586
Only fools

323
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,540
would go back to the very thing that keeps hurting them.

324
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:04,180
Love with all your heart.

325
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,897
But never make a fool of yourself.

326
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,738
It's time to move on.

327
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:21,740
Jean?

328
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:22,941
Jean.

329
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,061
Jean, can you come out?

330
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:28,715
Who's that?

331
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:29,415
I don't know.

332
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:30,860
Some next-door neighbour?

333
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,075
Jean.

334
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,740
Jean.

335
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,001
I need to talk to you.

336
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:49,998
I don't.

337
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:51,741
Just go home.

338
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:55,338
Will you go to prom with me?

339
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,236
Jedi's wedding, I mean.

340
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:06,768
I just want to tell you how much I like you.

341
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:12,138
I like that you have dreams.

342
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,318
You're a film director now.

343
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:19,340
I admire your strength.

344
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:21,684
You always fight for what is right

345
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,164
without caring what anyone thinks of you.

346
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,740
I adore your free spirit.

347
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,140
Your independence.

348
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,057
You do whatever you want

349
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,470
but never cause anyone trouble.

350
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,340
I feel really bad about this.

351
00:24:39,574 --> 00:24:42,763
I didn't want to be that wound in your heart.

352
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,940
There should be, like...

353
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:51,740
a million more people like you in the world.

354
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,740
The world doesn't need someone like me.

355
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:01,340
But it needs someone like you.

356
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:16,940
Jean...

357
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,340
Will you go to prom with me?

358
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,940
Give me another chance.

359
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:27,740
I promise I'll be the Alex you used to like.

360
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:42,138
Jean.

361
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:44,541
Jean!

362
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:20,445
Look at the camera.

363
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,349
Of course.

364
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:22,236
- Congratulations, man. - Congratulations, man.

365
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:22,590
Thanks.

366
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,706
You gotta be in sync, huh?

367
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:24,301
Alright.

368
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:25,368
Here we go.

369
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,140
Well, Nim.

370
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,411
Thanks for coming with me.

371
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:48,140
I would have to come alone otherwise.

372
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:50,540
Ew freaking came here with Liu.

373
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:51,741
He doesn't care about me anymore.

374
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:53,353
Yeah.

375
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:54,623
Sure.

376
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:57,740
We're the only two people no one wants anyway.

377
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,309
That may be true for me personally.

378
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:02,282
You, however, turned them down.

379
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:03,033
What's with you?

380
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:04,203
They tried to make up with you.

381
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:05,836
What's with your stone cold heart?

382
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,340
None of your business.

383
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:09,741
Focus on your damn self, man.

384
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:10,940
Well?

385
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:14,551
I guess you'll have to adapt

386
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:16,964
to the life of celibacy for all eternity now.

387
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:20,540
I really think Jean won't ever forgive you.

388
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,340
I'm gonna go get drinks.

389
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:27,255
What the hell, Nim?

390
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:28,941
Where's my encouragement, man?

391
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:30,371
Nim.

392
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:33,738
Like, honestly?

393
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:36,115
Are we the only two people who are here with their friend?

394
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:37,833
Everyone else brings their date.

395
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,485
You said no to Alex yourself, though.

396
00:27:40,485 --> 00:27:41,667
I can't help you with that.

397
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,540
He was putting on a full Romeo-and-Juliet performance.

398
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:46,363
And you were still mean to him?

399
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:48,852
Yeah.

400
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:52,255
Honestly, is there absolutely no way

401
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,140
you and Alex could be something more than this?

402
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:56,540
Something like what?

403
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,140
Like friends.

404
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,541
How could we be friends?

405
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,248
We had a crush on each other once.

406
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,140
We screwed once.

407
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,006
And he thoroughly hurt my feelings...

408
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:10,399
You think I can be friends with someone like that?

409
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:15,740
Bottoms up?

410
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:24,140
Please welcome the bride and the groom!

411
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:34,888
First of all, thank you everyone for coming to my wedding.

412
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:36,722
I've got nothing to say except that

413
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:39,371
I threw a prom themed party only because

414
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:42,141
I want to reminisce about the first days I fell in love with her.

415
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:48,140
Well, we're still very much in love.

416
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:50,540
And as you can all see...

417
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:52,940
Rose will always be the Prom Queen in my life.

418
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:59,492
That was as sweet as honey.

419
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:00,728
What about you, Rose?

420
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:03,063
Do you have anything to say to the groom?

421
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:06,710
I know we fight along the way,

422
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,740
but I am always so happy to have you by my side.

423
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,830
And...

424
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:13,963
You'll always be the Prom King to me, too, Jedi.

425
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,870
This is the perfect timing for the Prom King and the Prom Queen

426
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,340
to open the floor with their first slow dance.

427
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,851
Everyone else is welcome to grab their date

428
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:33,740
and celebrate this lovely occasion.

429
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,743
Come on.

430
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:30,140
Stop being so afraid.

431
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:32,544
I'm...

432
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:33,743
I'm not afraid.

433
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:36,140
I'm just not used to being so open.

434
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:39,740
Well, get used to it already.

435
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:42,138
'Cause I'm going to tell everyone,

436
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:45,165
and show off to everyone that you're my boyfriend.

437
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:47,587
You know what?

438
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:49,595
I'm going to shout here in the middle

439
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,126
of the damn floor that we're dating.

440
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:51,846
Listen up, guys—

441
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:52,352
Hold it.

442
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,141
Don't.

443
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:57,611
I won't.

444
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:58,943
As long as...

445
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:01,340
you dance with me.

446
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,005
Please?

447
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:07,169
I just want to have a slow dance with someone I've...

448
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,541
always had a crush on.

449
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:11,663
I mean it.

450
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:14,540
Trust me a little, will you?

451
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:19,340
Fine.

452
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,943
I'm not good at this, though.

453
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:24,525
It's alright.

454
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:25,944
I'll teach you.

455
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:50,392
Babe, what are you doing?

456
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:51,245
Why are you on your knees?

457
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,436
Babe, no.

458
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,140
Why are you on your knees?

459
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:58,368
I want you to be my Queen, too.

460
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,974
No, babe.

461
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,540
This is their wedding.

462
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,843
Don't steal the spotlight from Rose and Jedi.

463
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:07,340
But I want to be in this atmosphere,

464
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:09,021
like when we were in school,

465
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,940
when we first met.

466
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:18,140
There's not a lot of people who understand me for who I am.

467
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:21,740
I may not be your King, Liu,

468
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:27,740
but I'll try to be everything that you want.

469
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:45,532
You don't have to be anything.

470
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:46,734
Just be my good old See-ew.

471
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,138
I like you like that.

472
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:56,541
Marry me?

473
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,140
Hey.

474
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:38,140
Do you want something like that?

475
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,294
I'm all in, you know.

476
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:40,267
Nope.

477
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,140
You and I will never get to that point.

478
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:44,540
We haven't even started.

479
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:46,463
Don't be so pessimistic.

480
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:49,341
You don't think we're perfect for each other?

481
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:50,415
Sure.

482
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:52,881
But I need more time.

483
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,140
My heart's seal shut.

484
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:57,738
I'm not in a hurry.

485
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,140
I can wait.

486
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:33,740
Dudes.

487
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,206
How was it? Huh? Huh?

488
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,526
Was that romantic?

489
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:40,266
Huh?

490
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:42,138
Bad timing, man.

491
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,540
You stole the limelight.

492
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,165
Well, sorry.

493
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:49,340
She's the right person, and the timing was perfect.

494
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
When everything feels right,

495
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,679
you just gotta go for it, you know?

496
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,118
Let's talk about you guys.

497
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:56,138
Why are you two here together?

498
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,741
Oh...

499
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:00,035
Are you going for Alex now?

500
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:00,836
As if I would ever.

501
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:02,396
It's not like that.

502
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:04,652
Nim had a fight with Mollie

503
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,452
so she asked me to come with her.

504
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,427
Hold it right there, Alex.

505
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:10,555
That was full of crap.

506
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:13,009
It was you who asked me.

507
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,541
And why?

508
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,192
Because Jean turned you down, big time.

509
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:19,035
You hired a freaking fire truck to apologise and all, right?

510
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,566
Just shut your trap.

511
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:22,169
That was some melodrama bullcrap.

512
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:25,340
Alright. Enough, both of you.

513
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:30,140
My heart is full of love tonight.

514
00:35:30,335 --> 00:35:32,540
You two need to try harder.

515
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,140
I want you two to be happy the way I am happy.

516
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,006
Put your glasses down and come with me.

517
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:40,858
Come with you where?

518
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:41,777
Ew, where are we going?

519
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:43,091
- No, Ew, don't. - What the hell?

520
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:45,242
No, Ew.

521
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,966
Hi, Jean. Hi, Mollie.

522
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:51,163
My two friends here happen to be looking for a dance partner.

523
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,140
Idiot.

524
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,672
Sorry.

525
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,365
Can I borrow that?

526
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:00,140
Excuse me.

527
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,540
I thought you wanted to dance?

528
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:40,938
No.

529
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:44,531
I just needed to get you out of there so Jean could be alone with Alex.

530
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:53,775
Mollie.

531
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,464
I'm...

532
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:58,938
I'm sorry.

533
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,740
I'm sorry I still haven't sorted things out with myself.

534
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,340
I didn't mean to hurt you.

535
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,941
It's up to you, isn't it?

536
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,958
You want to be alone.

537
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,540
You want to raise your baby alone.

538
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,940
Who's gonna stop you?

539
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,740
Your life, your choice.

540
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,540
But I don't think I can take it

541
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:28,940
if you're gonna keep changing your mind.

542
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:31,340
Mollie.

543
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,940
To tell you the truth, I've never changed my mind.

544
00:37:35,316 --> 00:37:37,221
I miss you all the time.

545
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,129
But you know how I am.

546
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:40,938
I'm freaking stubborn.

547
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:44,475
I–I don't know.

548
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:45,740
I think I'm afraid.

549
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,639
I'm afraid...

550
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,540
I will get hurt again.

551
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,141
But you gotta try, right?

552
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:58,325
Is there anything in this world that is 100% safe?

553
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,863
There's none.

554
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,740
But at least,

555
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:05,756
you can be sure of one thing...

556
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:07,341
If you take my hand,

557
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:11,519
I'll make sure I won't hurt you.

558
00:38:21,784 --> 00:38:22,943
Fine.

559
00:38:22,943 --> 00:38:24,140
Let's give it a go.

560
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,664
Will you dance with me?

561
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:49,965
Just this once.

562
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,368
I won't ask for anything ever again.

563
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,540
What I said the other day...

564
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,140
I mean every word.

565
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,962
I'm so freaking proud of you, Jean.

566
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:51,740
I remember everything that happened that day...

567
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:55,341
the day we went around school, taking photos.

568
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:58,940
You told me you wanted to be a film director.

569
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,238
And you're one now.

570
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:12,140
You said you wanted to be a... photographer.

571
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:16,940
How come you're a gynaecologist now?

572
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:25,340
A lot of things happened along the way.

573
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,143
You probably won't believe me if I tell you.

574
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,664
I don't remember a lot of things that happened.

575
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,740
Everyone around me has all changed.

576
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,363
But my feelings for you...

577
00:40:49,138 --> 00:40:50,540
I remember that.

578
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:57,166
And I feel awful.

579
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,140
Very awful.

580
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,340
Everything I do right now,

581
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:13,963
I do it because I want you to have the life you once enjoyed.

582
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,940
I want you to be happy again.

583
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,537
Will you give me another chance, Jean?

584
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:24,439
Jean?

585
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:25,737
Jean!

586
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:26,854
Wait, Jean!

587
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:34,940
Jean.

588
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:44,540
Jean.

589
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:47,002
Jean.

590
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:48,138
Jean, why are you crying?

591
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:48,983
Jean.

592
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:50,540
Enough.

593
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:51,741
Enough already.

594
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,540
I thought I could forgive you, but I can't.

595
00:42:57,577 --> 00:42:58,940
I understand.

596
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:00,427
But I still want to try—

597
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:01,340
Don't.

598
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,740
Alex, you don't have to.

599
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:06,140
Please.

600
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:08,540
Just let me live my life.

601
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,528
Trying to get me to forgive you...

602
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:14,409
I keep replaying that night in my head.

603
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:16,940
Nothing has changed.

604
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:26,540
And do you know...

605
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:31,340
what happened after that?

606
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,541
I got pregnant.

607
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:56,541
We were both drunk.

608
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,940
You didn't use a condom.

609
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:01,288
I wasn't ready to have a baby

610
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:04,940
because I had dreams and a lot of things I still wanted to do.

611
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:08,203
And I had no one left I could talk to,

612
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,179
because if I told them,

613
00:44:09,204 --> 00:44:11,282
all they would say was that I brought it on myself.

614
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,940
So I went alone to get an abortion.

615
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:27,740
Where were you, Alex?

616
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,340
Where were you back then?

617
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,255
It's too late now.

618
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:35,670
Why didn't you tell me?

619
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,216
If you had told me, I would have stayed with you.

620
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:38,670
You wouldn't.

621
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:41,076
- No matter what you decided, I would have stayed. - No, you wouldn't.

622
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:42,143
You wouldn't.

623
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,940
You loved being in the middle of the spotlight

624
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:51,380
because you had sex one time with a girl at a party.

625
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,741
I am so sorry.

626
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:55,685
I didn't know what horrible things you had to go through.

627
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:57,066
I'm really sorry.

628
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,186
Tell me what you want me to do.

629
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:00,654
I will make it up to you.

630
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:01,691
Please, just tell me.

631
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:04,365
Enough. Stop saying sorry, Alex.

632
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:07,309
You've said sorry one too many times.

633
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:09,168
You don't need to say it anymore.

634
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:13,340
From now on,

635
00:45:14,054 --> 00:45:15,740
don't see me again.

636
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,140
If you want to fix things,

637
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,743
there's only one way.

638
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:31,340
Go back to the past.

639
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,140
Maybe you might change something.

640
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,540
Maybe, then...

641
00:45:39,149 --> 00:45:40,940
I might be able to forgive you.

642
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:49,340
Jean...

643
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,938
Why?

644
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:55,340
Why can't I fix these two damn photos?

645
00:46:57,925 --> 00:46:58,943
Why...

646
00:47:57,369 --> 00:47:58,408
Mum.

647
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:02,658
You brought me here because you wanted me to see, didn't you,

648
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:04,940
how I've ruined Jean's life?

649
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,162
I saw it.

650
00:48:10,507 --> 00:48:12,140
I saw everything.

651
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:14,540
I know now.

652
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:16,938
I will repent.

653
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:22,940
Just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it, Mum.

654
00:48:23,602 --> 00:48:25,376
I just want to...

655
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:27,738
turn back time and fix everything.

656
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:34,940
I just want Jean's life to be good again.

657
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:52,266
Look.

658
00:48:52,617 --> 00:48:55,340
I put it back on, your ring.

659
00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:01,340
Why... Why won't you care?

660
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:03,740
Why are you doing this?

661
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:06,140
You know, don't you?

662
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:09,740
Your curse is ruining my life!

663
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:51,269
Alex.

664
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,940
Mr. Saran?

665
00:50:00,215 --> 00:50:01,340
Why are you here?

666
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,346
I always come here.

667
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:09,740
Your mother used to love coming here with me.

668
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:12,140
Do you realise

669
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:15,119
you and your present

670
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:19,340
has ruined a woman's life?

671
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,698
What are you talking about?

672
00:50:23,698 --> 00:50:25,343
This stupid camera

673
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,940
brought me here

674
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,904
to face this issue I will never be able to solve.

675
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:36,140
And it makes me feel eternally guilty.

676
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,765
Alex,

677
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:45,740
does the issue

678
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:48,140
lie with this camera

679
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:50,540
or with you?

680
00:50:56,174 --> 00:50:57,740
The guilt you're talking about,

681
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:01,340
I've lived with that my entire life.

682
00:51:03,386 --> 00:51:06,140
That's why I've done everything I can to fix it.

683
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,943
I've done everything to make it up to you.

684
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:14,540
I just want another chance

685
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:16,940
to be your father.

686
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:25,340
I only have one dad.

687
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:32,540
You will never forgive me no matter what?

688
00:51:35,646 --> 00:51:37,341
Can you turn back time?

689
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:44,540
I get it now.

690
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,140
But at least...

691
00:51:52,832 --> 00:51:54,491
Can you keep this camera?

692
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,366
It's the last thing

693
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:01,340
that connects me to you...

694
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,738
and your mother.

695
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,612
Can I take a photo of you with this camera?

696
00:52:49,144 --> 00:52:50,540
Do you really want my photo?

697
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:56,543
Stand here, please.

698
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:06,140
This is the place

699
00:53:06,701 --> 00:53:08,540
I gave Mum my promise.
