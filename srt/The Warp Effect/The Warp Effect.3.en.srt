4
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:10,115
What actually happened?

5
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:13,954
This camera was the reason you travelled ten years in the future?

6
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:15,865
Ew, why are you taking him here?

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,114
I’m not listening to a traitor like him.

8
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,631
Stay with me.

9
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,827
We can… do something fun together.

10
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:23,594
We agreed we’d be fuck buddies.

Kat and I are friends with benefits?

You’re doing it with Kat?

13
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,462
I wish.

14
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:28,950
It’s my mother’s curse.

15
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,154
I can never climax again.

16
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:31,945
Maybe you need to fix it from the very beginning.

17
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:33,658
But who was my first time?

18
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,659
Did we have sex that night?

19

Just hold it together, Alex.

You do this every day.

25
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:56,711
There must be some kind of muscle memory in this body.

Let’s do it!

Doctor, my hoo-haw is dark, but I want it pink.

What should I do?

29
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:04,973
That can be done?

00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:06,154
Yes, Doctor.

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,575
Doctor, my vajayjay smells.

00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:10,897

It’s been a long time. How have you been?

67
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,467
I haven’t seen you since our St. Jonathan’s days,

68
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:10,154
actually, ever since that…

69
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:18,015
What do you do these days?

70
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,531
I’m a freelance director.

71
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,968
I make ads and music videos, mostly.

72
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:22,955
What about you, Kat?

73
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,560
Me? I’m a flight attendant.

74
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,155
Do you see any of our old friends?

75
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,044
No.

76
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,114
I didn’t really have that many friends to begin with.

77
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,337
I wasn’t one of you popular girls, you know.

78
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:37,132
You’re exaggerating.

79
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:42,901
I do remember it was your doing that got us girlies free tampons at school.

80
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,143
You were our hero, you know that?

81
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:48,179
It needed to be done.

82
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,154
If we don’t fight for what we deserve, who else will?

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,335
What are you looking for?

84
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:55,862
Just some pads and painkillers.

85
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,144
I have really bad period cramps.

86
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,810
It’s like that every time I get my period.

87
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,153
Actually, even when I don’t get my period, it still hurts.

88
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:08,114
Isn’t it actually bad to take meds for cramps all the time?

89
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:12,114
But if you’re always on location, you probably don’t have time.

90
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,938
I think if you can afford it, you should see a doctor about this, like seriously.

91
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,659
Just have a full checkup.

92
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,550
I regularly get a pelvic exam, test for HPV and stuff.

93
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,154
Hang on, maybe you should see Alex.

94
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:29,046
He’s a really great gynaecologist, and famous, too.

95
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:31,628
Do you remember Alex? From class?

96
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,151
You probably do. You two had beef once.

97
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:42,018
If you’re no longer bummed about that, try seeing him.

98
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,594
He’s a really great gynaecologist.

99
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:46,153
I always see him.

100
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:48,114
Alright?

101
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,957
Well, I’ll think about it.

102
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,129
Excuse me for now.

103
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,339
I… have cramps.

104
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:05,142
Lex.

105
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,114
The only reason I asked you to come here today

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,831
is because I want to give you a chance.

107
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:12,114
Now answer me.

108
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,867
Why did you kiss Mollie?

109
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,115
Nim, listen.

110
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:18,154
I really don’t know.

111
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,207
I was drunk.

112
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,037
I was wasted.

113
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,449
Asshole!

114
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,778
What kind of excuse is that?

115
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,216
You do realise I broke up with Mollie because of that, don’t you?

116
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:26,155
Come on.

117
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,458
What do you care now?

118
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,136
You broke up ages ago.

119
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,160
And you’re already dating someone else.

120
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,114
Shut the hell up, Ew.

121
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,154
That has nothing to do with this.

122
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,276
I just want to be well loved.

123
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:39,587
I don’t want anyone to hate me.

124
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,719
I don’t want to die owing anyone anything.

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,114
What are you, a pageant queen?

126
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,923
Wake up, sister, wake up.

127
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,612
He said he was pissed drunk.

128
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:49,328
Drunk or not, he gotta take responsibility.

129
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,009
You need to pay for ruining my love life.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,739
What do you want me to do?

131
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,440
Hey, look.

132
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,111
This is exactly like what my father said.

133
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,155
Here comes your first adversity,

134
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,155
and it’s Nim.

135
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,163
Nim, wait.

136
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:08,276
I have a photo for you to look at.

137
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,805
Look at it first.

138
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,265
Like hell I will.

139
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:19,241
Hey, Lex.

140
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:21,003
You really scared?

141
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,154
Just come here already.

142
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,175
Come here, man.

143
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,729
I’m starting to be scared for you.

144
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,114
Why are you making me the referee?

145
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,154
It serves you just right.

146
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,113
Lex.

147
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:32,958
Come.

148
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,659
Hurry.

149
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,303
Come here.

150
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,749
Come here.

151
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,034
Just take a punch and pretend to be knocked out cold.

152
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,824
- I’m scared. - Come on.

153
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,047
Get him.

154
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,115
Start!

155
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,154
Come on.

156
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,154
Alex, put up a fight.

157
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,154
- Get up, Alex. - Alright!

158
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,154
Come at me!

159
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,185
That’s a miss.

160
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,640
You ain’t got nothin’ on me, bro.

161
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,536
Asshole…

162
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,246
I was… out since the first punch.

163
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,425
Holy crap.

164
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,114
This is me?

165
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,153
When did I even do this?

166
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:55,714
See what I told you?

167
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:58,077
Ew, let her see more.

168
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:00,114
The first time I laid eyes on these,

169
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,154
I made the exact same face.

170
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:07,409
What I remember is that I was tied up, in the trunk of a car,

171
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,803
and then they took my photo.

172
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:11,806
Next thing I knew I was already at the hospital.

173
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,981
I don’t even know how the hell I’ve become a doctor.

174
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:15,188
Enough, enough.

175
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,106
I don’t wanna hear anything anymore.

176
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:17,271
You have to.

177
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,037
These photos are telling us our future.

178
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,148
Look.

179
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:23,244
You’re clearly giving birth.

180
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,148
That’s never gonna happen.

181
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,932
I’m never gonna do that.

182
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,114
How could I?

183
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,154
Shocked, aren’t you?

184
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,805
Gives me goosebumps.

185
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:32,837
You got goosebumps…

186
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:34,968
But I nearly got my face bashed off.

187
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,030
Jean slapped me and your lackey almost knocked me out.

188
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,148
Why?

189
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:41,241
Why won’t anyone listen to me?

190
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,140
You two have to help me fix this.

191
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:53,542
Alright. Bring it together.

192
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,009
This here is the relationship chart I’ve been preparing.

193
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,153
What the…

194
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,914
When did you even have time to do this?

195
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,154
What I’m trying to say is…

196
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:23,205
Right now, we have a photo for everyone we know.

197
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:28,114
But there’s something wrong with these photos.

198
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:32,114
What we need to do is to know what’s wrong and fix it.

199
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:34,154
Hold on a sec.

200
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,550
Where’s yours?

201
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,504
I’ll deal with my own issue.

202
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:39,920
Don’t worry about it.

203
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:43,920
But where are my photo and Jean’s photo?

204
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:50,071
I remember taking one of Jean at the party.

205
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:54,155
And Army took one of me when I was in the trunk of the car.

206
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,114
Where are those?

207
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,825
That’s the point.

208
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,651
We have to look for them.

209
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,726
Let’s see.

210
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,022
Let’s start with the first one.

211
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,114
It’s Jedi and Rose.

212
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:07,120
They’re both sitting in front of a hospital exam room.

213
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:10,113
Maybe they’re going to have some health issues?

214
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:12,071
What’s happened to them, though?

215
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:12,932
Are they still together?

216
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,720
From what I see on Instagram,

217
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:17,076
they’re still going strong.

218
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:19,041
They’re rolling in money.

219
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:21,630
Jedi has a bar.

220
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,154
Rose takes care of the money coming in and out

221
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,114
and selling some cosmetics online.

222
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,152
Next.

223
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,152
Army.

224
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,531
He’s laying on someone’s chest.

225
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:33,545
Not weird.

226
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:36,154
He’s gay. It’s only right he’s sleeping on some dudebro’s chest.

227
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:38,115
Could it be yours, Alex?

228
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:41,249
My nipples are pinker than those, man.

229
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,250
Are they, now?

230
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,792
Can we just move on?

231
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,112
Kat.

232
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:50,094
Why is she bruised all over?

233
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:54,152
Maybe she’s going to be in a fight? Over some guy?

234
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,471
Kat? Fight over a guy?

235
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,154
She’s so pretty she never has to do that.

236
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:00,850
Mollie.

237
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:03,002
From what we can see here in the photo…

238
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,361
It just looks like a normal mirror selfie.

239
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,114
I think she looks like she’s about to cry.

240
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,154
Maybe…

241
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,494
this is a warning.

242
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:15,519
Is she going to kill herself?

243
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,839
You kill yourself, asshat.

244
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,073
Watch your mouth.

245
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,510
But it’s possible.

246
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:20,514
Next up.

247
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,110
This photo.

248
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,280
It’s you, Nim.

249
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,046
No matter how you look at it, you’re freaking in labour.

250
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,704
No, I don’t think so.

251
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,932
I think maybe I’ll have an operation or something.

252
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:30,963
Guessing from the position.

253
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:34,114
But from my experience as a gynaecologist,

254
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,753
that really looks like you’re giving birth.

255
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,048
You want me to give you credits as a gynaecologist?

256
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,154
How many days have you been one?

257
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:43,074
Ew, what about your photo? The one where you’re getting arrested.

258
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,154
Get it on the board for us to analyse.

259
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,200
Hell yeah.

260
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:47,244
You talk big when it comes to someone else’s puzzles,

261
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,383
now let us see yours.

262
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,996
I’d love to have a go at dissecting it.

263
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:56,088
Maybe you have some weird kinky sex and get arrested?

264
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:57,716
What are you talking about?

265
00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:00,154
I’ll deal with my own damn issue.

266
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,115
Shut up. There’s nothing to laugh about.

267
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:43,950
Which one do you like?

268
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:44,936
The Husky one?

269
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:46,115
Should we go with grey or pink?

270
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:47,779
There’s a wolf mask, too.

271
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,536
Even a pharaoh mask.

272
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:52,154
Babe, don’t you already have one at home?

273
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,545
Oh, come on.

274
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,138
I want something new.

275
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:57,905
Please?

276
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:58,803
Please.

277
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,155
Please, babe.

278
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,117
- Please. - Fine.

279
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:04,155
The grey one.

280
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:05,574
Grey?

281
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,635
Excuse me. Can I try it on?

282
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:09,950
Babe, wait.

283
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,155
You don’t need to try it on here.

284
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:14,112
It’s embarrassing.

285
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:17,142
What’s there to be embarrassed about? It’s only normal.

286
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,692
Normal?

287
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:22,539
Normal would be going shopping together.

288
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,726
But look what you’re doing.

289
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:26,113
You’re taking me to shop for some dog masks and leather suits.

290
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,495
This isn’t normal.

291
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,674
I thought you liked it.

292
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:33,959
It’s not that I don’t. But I can’t do this all the time.

293
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,974
Do you ever ask me what I actually like?

294
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,351
Then what do you like?

295
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,922
Dog masks? Pig masks?

296
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:40,897
Or tigers?

297
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,734
Wait… maybe you like handcuffs?

298
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,113
Babe, that’s not what I meant.

299
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,028
I wasn’t talking about anything in here.

300
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:04,154
Wait, is that Liu?

301
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:04,994
Is it?

302
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:06,112
Liu?

303
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:09,107
What are you two doing here?

304
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,366
We just had dinner together around here.

305
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,233
We’re about to go shopping.

306
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,233
Rose wants a new handbag.

307
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,034
She’s been going on about it.

308
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,339
Sulking actually.

309
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,637
I just can’t not buy it for her.

310
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,114
What about you? What are you doing here?

311
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,154
Isn’t this a sex toy shop?

312
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,739
Don’t tell me…

313
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:30,113
I’m just waiting for See-ew.

314
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,641
I’m not buying anything.

315
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,467
You two enjoy this?

316
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:38,941
Leather suits? Chains, whips, and handcuffs?

317
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:39,500
No—.

318
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,816
That’s freaking cool.

319
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:41,882
Babe, what do you think?

320
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:42,843
Should we try leather?

321
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:44,909
- Nope. - But I’d like to be in chains, babe.

322
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,696
- No way. - Even Liu likes it.

323
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:48,993
It’s out of my comfort zone.

324
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:53,116
No, but… I don’t actually like this kind of thing.

325
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:57,142
See-ew is just taking a look around for fun. He’ll be here soon.

326
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:01,056
Why don’t you get a collar for your boyfriend?

327
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,440
Seeing that he seems to always act like a dog around you.

328
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:06,117
You cutie pie.

329
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,114
Enough now.

330
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:12,702
We’re off, then.

331
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,301
I don’t want him changing his mind about that new bag.

332
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,956
As if I would, babe. I know you really want it.

333
00:17:18,957 --> 00:17:19,585
Let’s go, then.

334
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:20,355
Bye, hon.

335
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:21,038
See you.

336
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:22,019
See you around.

337
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:22,937
Take care.

338
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:24,111
Make him buy you ten.

339
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,099
Hell yeah.

340
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,238
Well shit.

341
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,339
This is my car?

342
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,437
What’s that?

343
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,115
Oh, fu—.

344
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,152
Army?

345
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,197
Hold on. Stop.

346
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,869
I have to go.

347
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:23,438
Get out.

348
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,115
Wait.

349
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,115
But I still want to see you.

350
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:29,597
I have to go to work.

351
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:31,633
I’ll come see you again.

352
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:32,243
Nope.

353
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,154
If I want it, I’ll call.

354
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,021
Crap, crap, crap.

355
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,022
What the hell was that?

356
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,656
Alex.

357
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:43,015
Army, don’t hurt me.

358
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,155
Stop. Stop.

359
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,735
What did you see?

360
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:53,231
I… I saw you and that guy hitting it off.

361
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,154
And?

362
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:01,539
Well… Yeah, and what about that?

363
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,771
Why are you following me?

364
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:08,054
’Cause you’re acting like you didn’t know anything about my sex life.

365
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:13,139
I always tell you who I bang and whatnot.

366
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:19,444
You even seemed like you were interested in swinging this way.

367
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:20,619
You don’t remember that?

368
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,071
Are we really that close?

369
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,399
We tell each other about our sex lives?

370
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,272
Yeah.

371
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:29,345
Can you like explain to me how the hell we got so friendly?

372
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:30,868
What’s wrong with you?

373
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,846
We got close in high school after Jedi’s party.

374
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:36,155
You don’t remember?

375
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,256
Since when did you turn gay?

376
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:39,994
You were dating Kat.

377
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

378
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,154
I broke up with Kat ages ago.

379
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:48,154
After that I’ve only ever been with men.

380
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,114
What are you so confused about?

381
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:56,154
I think passing out that day really messed up your brain.

382
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,114
This can’t wait.

383
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,113
We need to get you x-rayed.

384
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:01,904
- Come with me. - Wait. Hold on.

385
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:02,606
I’m okay.

386
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:03,631
I’m fine.

387
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:06,274
I think I just don’t get enough rest.

388
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,136
My brain must have taken a toll and now I don’t have all my memories.

389
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:13,129
I think you should just… get back to your business with that guy in the car.

390
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,702
Have a good time.

391
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,246
No, I think we need to go.

392
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,180
No, I’m fine.

393
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,194
- I’m outta here. - Hurry up.

394
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:19,195
I said I’m fine.

395
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,195
Bye.

396
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:39,656
Are you here to see Dad?

397
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,058
He’s at the hospital.

398
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,114
What’s wrong? What’s happened to him?

399
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:47,643
But you’re his favourite kid. Why you asking me?

400
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,129
What do you mean?

401
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,114
You need a freaking recap?

402
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:54,771
I couldn’t get into medical school.

403
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,114
I became the family disappointment

404
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:59,040
and you decided to pursue a medical career.

405
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:04,879
But really, I gotta thank you for going to medical school in my place.

406
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,444
Now I get to follow my dream of becoming a rock star.

407
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,154
Ice, listen to me.

408
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:12,482
I don’t know what happened to me.

409
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:16,115
But one sure thing is I never want to be a doctor like Dad is.

410
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,545
What I need to tell you is…

411
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:22,154
I came here from the past.

412
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:26,662
Do you— Do you remember that movie?

413
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:31,294
The main character travels back in time in a car with a dog and a scientist?

414
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:33,467
But my time machine is an instant camera.

415
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,114
I clicked the shutter and I just got here.

416
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:39,043
Suddenly I’m a freaking gynaecologist.

417
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,619
You…

418
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,728
You think I’m stupid enough to believe you?

419
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:49,128
Do you think you’re smarter than me just ’cause you’re a doctor now?

420
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:52,115
You never support me and now you’re looking down on me?

421
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,655
Wait, wait, Ice.

422
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:56,111
But I’m telling you the truth.

423
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:59,142
I’m confused, too. Just like the dog in that movie.

424
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,114
What’s wrong?

425
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,155
Did you fight with Alex?

426
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,750
Yeah, I did.

427
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:23,846
He never came home in a million years.

428
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:30,111
But now he’s back, with his time travel bullshit.

429
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:31,600
Did he think I’m an idiot?

430
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,294
Calm down.

431
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:38,112
Maybe he misses his brother and just wants to catch up?

432
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,152
That wouldn’t be a weird joke.

433
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,751
We’re not close. He’s never home.

434
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,154
Why’d he try to get friendly with me now?

435
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:46,840
Listen.

436
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,616
I actually envy you a lot, you know?

437
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,617
I’ve always wanted a big sister.

438
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:54,115
Being an only child is freaking lonely.

439
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:59,241
I want to steal her stuff and talk about nonsense.

440
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,154
Give your brother a chance. He’s trying his best.

441
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:17,426
Come to think of it, you do look a little like him.

442
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:20,939
No way.

443
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,038
I’m hotter.

444
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,551
Oh, the nerve.

445
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:29,145
Are you saying you think he’s hotter, Kim?

446
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,940
Careful.

447
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,249
Careful now.

448
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:41,249
You can’t answer?

449
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,439
Ice, no!

450
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,185
Tell me who’s hotter.

451
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:47,557
- No. - Who?

452
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,254
It’s you, Ice.

453
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,981
You’re the hottest guy ever.

454
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:53,360
I would never approach you at the bar otherwise.

455
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:55,289
You were so hot with that guitar.

456
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,290
That’s real genuine.

457
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:42,114
You like that?

458
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:43,481
Hello, everyone.

459
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,174
Ya’ll with Blossom today.

460
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:46,735
I’ve got something special to recommend.

461
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,271
[Adult Toy Review] I’ve got something special to recommend.

462
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:51,424
And it’s… a vibrator. [Adult Toy Review]

463
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:51,675
And it’s… a vibrator.

464
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,976
That’s interesting.

465
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,976
Should we try it?

466
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:59,046
Sure. It looks cute.

467
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,934
It’s not too intimidating.

468
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:02,494
Let’s switch to toys every once in a while.

469
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:03,608
Getting a little bored of the real thing.

470
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,114
Why’d you say that?

471
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:07,543
What?

472
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:09,354
Am I not good enough for you?

473
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,155
Or have we dated so long

474
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:14,006
that our sex isn’t spicy anymore?

475
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:17,996
Not at all, baby.

476
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:20,155
You’re still the best.

477
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:26,114
I just think

478
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,113
if we have something that spices it up a little, it could be nice.

479
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:31,276
Like what?

480
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:33,131
This sex toy thing?

481
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:38,928
I mean… a future, a marriage, even children.

482
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:41,271
Now you’re just talking nonsense.

483
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:43,071
How can we get married?

484
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:44,526
Where do you think we live?

485
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,507
It can’t legally be done, you know.

486
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:49,785
That’s why I don’t want to stay here and wait.

487
00:25:49,786 --> 00:25:51,908
I want to move somewhere far.

488
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:54,114
Get married and raise children there.

489
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:55,873
That kind of thing, you know.

490
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:57,587
I’m older than you.

491
00:25:57,588 --> 00:26:01,833
What if one day my uterus gives out and never produces eggs again?

492
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,323
Babe, you think you’re old?

493
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:05,803
You?

494
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:10,114
What oldie would be as adorable as you?

495
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,055
But I’m worried.

496
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:15,682
Will you come to the checkup with me?

497
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:16,744
Please?

498
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,111
Please, please, please.

499
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:21,238
Please, please, please, please.

500
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,154
Alright.

501
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,238
Babe.

502
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:47,203
Babe, what are you doing?

503
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:48,157
Someone could see us.

504
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,483
No one will.

505
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,114
Alex and Nim left.

506
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:57,539
Did you tell them about us?

507
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:01,346
No.

508
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:03,914
They wouldn’t understand.

509
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:07,043
You’re the only one who does, you know that?

510
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:12,152
Babe, enough.

511
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,154
Can we stop this roleplay for like a day?

512
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:19,040
Can you just act like normal people?

513
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,154
What are you saying?

514
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,114
Are you saying I’m not normal?

515
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,113
I’m sorry.

516
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,154
That was harsh.

517
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:40,154
You can be honest with me.

518
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:43,540
I noticed something was wrong at the sex shop, too.

519
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:48,152
It’s nothing.

520
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:49,371
I’m tired.

521
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:51,491
Something came up at work.

522
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:54,114
I want to see my boyfriend and be pampered.

523
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:56,154
I don’t want to always have to do whatever this is.

524
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:01,049
Can’t you be a little more romantic like other guys?

525
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:18,114
Sure.

526
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,154
Sorry

527
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:22,910
for not being like anyone else.

528
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,155
Sorry for not being normal.

529
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,659
But really…

530
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,938
You should have told me.

531
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,114
Shouldn’t have faked it all this time.

532
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:33,437
Ew.

533
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,006
Ew.

534
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:37,142
Listen to me, will you?

535
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:28,723
Hello, y’all.

536
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:32,111
You’re with Pinky Blossom today.

537
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:36,028
I want every single one of you to have fun,

538
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:38,988
feel the pleasure, and just relax with me.

539
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:41,782
Tell me what you want me to do.

540
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:43,539
Do you want me to be your master?

541
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,929
Do you want me to be your kitten?

542
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,757
Just send me your request.

543
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:50,157
I’d love to play with you.

544
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,117
Can I join you?

545
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:10,154
I’m so tired today.

546
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,114
There were so many silly passengers.

547
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,170
Kat, can I ask you something?

548
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,880
Yeah?

549
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:33,183
How did we get here?

550
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,114
Where is here?

551
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,154
Well…

552
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:42,505
How did we become friends with benefits?

553
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:44,114
How did we…

554
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:48,114
become someone who’d be fine getting naked in a bath together?

555
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:50,154
Is something wrong, Alex?

556
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,880
Or is this your new foreplay?

557
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,634
Like a reminiscing play?

558
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:58,943
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,080
I want to set the mood.

560
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:06,154
I just want us to feel… like our first time.

561
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:11,996
Well, then.

562
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,154
Our first time…

563
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,844
was at St. Jonathan’s.

564
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:27,492
I pushed you onto a desk and touched you everywhere to turn you on.

565
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,494
We made out really intensely.

566
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:32,114
[Short Film Club] We made out really intensely.

567
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:33,825
[Short Film Club]

568
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,812
We made love like animals.

569
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:44,840
Hold on, Kat.

570
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:49,975
Our first time was… in a classroom?

571
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:54,114
I thought we did it at Jedi’s party.

572
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:56,743
Jedi’s party?

573
00:31:57,478 --> 00:32:00,153
We only kissed that night.

574
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,439
You were so drunk.

575
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Heaven only knows who else you slept with.

576
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:09,638
Last time, the lights went out when we were in bed.

577
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:15,140
Should we spice it up and do it in the bath this time?

578
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:18,114
Kat.

579
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,154
I’m sorry.

580
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,114
I can’t do this anymore.

581
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:24,154
What do you mean?

582
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,696
Is everything alright, Alex?

583
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:27,143
You seem to be out of it lately.

584
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:28,737
Wait…

585
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,075
Do you have erectile dysfunction?

586
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:33,344
Why didn’t you tell me?

587
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:36,085
Go see Army. Isn’t he an expert on that?

588
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,511
No, Kat. That’s not it.

589
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,114
I just think we shouldn’t be in this kind of relationship.

590
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,114
I… I want to be more respectful.

591
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:48,760
Be respectful?

592
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:49,739
I don’t want you to be respectful.

593
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,216
I want you to satisfy me.

594
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:54,112
We agreed we would keep each other company on lonely days.

595
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:56,154
But I can’t be that for you anymore.

596
00:32:57,772 --> 00:32:59,040
I’m really sorry.

597
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:02,835
My life really is a mess right now.

598
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,151
I…

599
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,646
It’s…

600
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,740
Well, yeah. I just can’t tell you about it.

601
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,826
Do you…

602
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,942
have a new fuck buddy?

603
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,944
Ugh, men.

604
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:20,157
Why can’t you just tell me honestly?

605
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,859
Is it really so hard to say it straight?

606
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,768
You wanna quit? You wanna keep going?

607
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,258
Just tell me if you don’t wanna do this anymore.

608
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:26,489
It’s only fair.

609
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,044
There’s a bunch of people out there who want to do this with me.

610
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,002
Good for me.

611
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:33,055
I’m getting sick of your game, too.

612
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:36,152
A girl like me never runs out of anyone to sleep with.

613
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,845
From the physical exam,

614
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:56,154
you have some health issue I’d like to address.

615
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:59,683
It’s your ovulation.

616
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:01,684
You have chronic anovulation.

617
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:07,539
What does that mean?

618
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:12,153
Will it affect me if I want to have children?

619
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:13,737
It will.

620
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:16,154
You said you want to get pregnant.

621
00:34:16,828 --> 00:34:18,480
This could make it really difficult.

622
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:20,155
Your chances are slim.

623
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,440
We can start looking for treatments right now.

624
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,114
We can try ovulation induction

625
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:28,740
or removal of ovarian cysts.

626
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,270
But none of these come with a guaranteed result.

627
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,543
It is a long process.

628
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,206
Mineral water from a mineral spring.

629
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,343
Grab a fresh drink and quench your thirst.

630
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:00,152
Okay. Cut.

631
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:03,689
It looks like it’s going to rain.

632
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,114
Let’s take a break.

633
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:09,443
It rains every day, does it?

634
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:11,371
We’re not going to wrap this in time.

635
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:12,948
The next one is a big scene, too.

636
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:14,769
It’s getting really dark.

637
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,216
Anyone knows any spells against rain?

638
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:18,623
At this point, we might have to sacrifice virgins to the rain god.

639
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:23,529
Any of you still a virgin?

640
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:28,154
What about those girls over there? Are they?

641
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:31,071
That’s too much, man.

642
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:46,840
Crap.

643
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,114
Excuse me.

644
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:03,576
Do you have a pad I can borrow?

645
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:06,114
I forgot to bring my bag.

646
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,318
Of course.

647
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:08,154
Wait a minute.

648
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:10,646
Here.

649
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:12,735
Thank you.

650
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,853
Everything alright now, Jean?

651
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:24,939
Wait, you know me?

652
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,318
I do.

653
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,154
I work with you.

654
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,562
But I’m working for the sound effect team. I’m here to inspect.

655
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:34,877
I’m new, though. I guess that’s why we haven’t met.

656
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:36,891
I’m so sorry. I was so preoccupied.

657
00:36:36,892 --> 00:36:37,880
But it’s so nice to meet you.

658
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:38,958
What’s your name?

659
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,152
It’s Kim.

660
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:41,246
Okay.

661
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:45,060
I’ll keep in mind that this girl named Kim saved my life today.

662
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:47,778
When I do get my period, it’s always so heavy.

663
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:50,114
I change pad after pad.

664
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:51,565
That’s one big expense right there.

665
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:54,114
I think we deserve to get free sanitary products.

666
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:57,459
At least the government should reduce tax on these things, you know?

667
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,562
You’re so right.

668
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:02,822
Who knew puberty comes with such an expense for us girls?

669
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:05,171
And what is it for men? Their voice changes?

670
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:06,115
You’re totally right.

671
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:07,957
We speak the same language, huh?

672
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,947
You know, I actually had to rally for this back in school.

673
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:14,114
I can talk about this for hours. We should do that later.

674
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:15,266
Of course.

675
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,942
Let’s get back to work for now.

676
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,112
Alright.

677
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:26,114
What?

678
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,838
Why would someone like you need my help?

679
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:30,679
Army, please.

680
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,031
Just teach me how to do a pelvic exam.

681
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:35,579
Are you out of your mind?

682
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,443
I only examine guys.

683
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:39,904
Why don’t you go ask Dr. Sonya?

684
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:44,154
I bet talking to a girl doctor is much better for you than talking to a gay doctor like me.

685
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:47,185
Who’s Dr. Sonya?

686
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:51,337
She’s your senior gynaecologist.

687
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:57,957
But I don’t remember her phone number.

688
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,698
My phone’s acting weird.

689
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,465
I lost all my contact info.

690
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,114
Can you… call her for me?

691
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:08,155
Please?

692
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,114
Please?

693
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,154
Fine.

694
00:38:12,745 --> 00:38:17,343
Do you… want me to stay with you?

695
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:19,625
You don’t have to.

696
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:22,154
It’s not like I want to.

697
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:24,064
I was just asking.

698
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:26,154
I’ve got loads of work as it is.

699
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,520
Call her for me.

700
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:43,242
Hello, Mr. Hottest-Gynaecologist-of-the-Era.

701
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:45,219
Why do you need a lesson on pelvic exam all of a sudden?

702
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
You already know what to do.

703
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:50,360
I just want to review.

704
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,800
I get forgetful sometimes.

705
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:56,152
So I want to make sure that what I know is completely correct.

706
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:58,963
This isn’t something that can be done in a flash.

707
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:00,058
Don’t worry.

708
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,844
My brain knows what to do, it just needs a little nudge.

709
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:05,895
When performing a pelvic exam,

710
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:06,701
[GYNAECOLOGY 101] When performing a pelvic exam,

711
00:39:06,702 --> 00:39:08,584
doctors like us have to consider many things. [GYNAECOLOGY 101]

712
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:08,988
doctors like us have to consider many things.

713
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:11,105
First, examine the external.

714
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:15,022
Make sure your patient can trust you and feel confident that they’re safe with you.

715
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:19,438
Since you’re a guy doctor, you need a female nurse present in the room, too.

716
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:25,019
This whole thing is the female reproductive organ.

717
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,246
The ovaries, the uterus, and the vagina.

718
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:32,934
When you’re doing the do, this is where the penis comes in.

719
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,320
Once the sperm enters, it waits here.

720
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,722
The ovaries will release eggs which will travel here.

721
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:40,449
When the eggs meet the sperm, it becomes a fetus.

722
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,473
Performing a pelvic exam starts with hygiene.

723
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:46,113
Take a cotton ball and wipe the vulva from top to bottom.

724
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,154
Like this. Make sure you’re thorough.

725
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:51,171
Spread it out and see if something’s wrong inside.

726
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,326
Insert the speculum this way,

727
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:55,496
then rotate it.

728
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:57,489
Now use your eyes and inspect the internal.

729
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,760
See if there’s something wrong inside.

730
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:01,850
If there is, you can get it out.

731
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:04,154
Close it.

732
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,057
Rotate it.

733
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,368
Take it out.

734
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:08,762
You won’t hurt your patient that way.

735
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,117
Here. Read.

736
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:19,037
Nurse, please get the next patient.

737
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:19,856
Yes.

738
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:31,742
Hello.

739
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:43,430
Jean.

740
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:46,112
Do you know each other?

741
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:48,154
Yes.

742
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:50,112
We were friends.

743
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:52,892
Can I change the doctor?

744
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:54,396
Why?

745
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,841
You said you were fine with male doctors.

746
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,114
It’s alright.

747
00:40:58,115 --> 00:40:59,805
Let her change her doctor.

748
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:04,153
The patient may feel uncomfortable being examined by an acquaintance.

749
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:07,443
But you’re the only doctor here today, Dr. Alex.

750
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,114
You may need to reschedule, ma’am.

751
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,154
I…

752
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:20,153
It’s alright.

753
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:22,114
Let’s do it. I’m in a hurry.

754
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:25,339
Please have a seat.

755
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,937
So you have menstrual cramps?

756
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,554
How often do you experience this?

757
00:41:38,555 --> 00:41:40,154
Every month?

758
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,646
Well, not really before. This is new.

759
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:48,154
Do you feel a swell on your stomach?

760
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:50,114
Is there a lump when you touch it?

761
00:41:54,535 --> 00:42:00,154
I have to ask more questions to make a diagnosis.

762
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,154
Have you had…

763
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:11,894
sexual intercourse before or recently?

764
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:14,115
Did you use protection?

765
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:31,325
I think we need to perform a pelvic exam

766
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:34,114
in order to find the cause.

767
00:42:35,948 --> 00:42:37,814
Please, prepare the table.

768
00:42:37,815 --> 00:42:38,952
Yes.

769
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,637
Please rest your bottom on the table.

770
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:55,540
You can breathe normally.

771
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:59,050
I’m going to insert the speculum.

772
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:01,696
You may feel a little discomfort.

773
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:39,675
No. I can’t do it.

774
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:41,560
I can’t.

775
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:43,265
I don’t want a checkup anymore.

776
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:45,194
Ma’am, where are you going?

777
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:46,635
Jean.

778
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:47,856
Jean.

779
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:48,858
Doctor?

780
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:49,779
Jean.

781
00:43:50,175 --> 00:43:55,905
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

782
00:43:56,056 --> 00:43:59,442
I don’t like actors who don’t even bother going through auditions.

783
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:02,154
If it’s for Jean, I’d be more than happy to audition.

784
00:44:04,471 --> 00:44:06,154
Can you get pregnant for me?

785
00:44:07,794 --> 00:44:09,740
You need to sleep with me.

786
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:12,157
Tell us what the hell this dog head thing is for.

787
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:18,108
Lex, now you know your two best friends’ problems.

788
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:21,237
Did your other best friend, Army, never tell you anything?

789
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:25,292
What if he slept with the wrong guy and got himself arrested?

790
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:31,922
You’re a coach here?

791
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:33,152
Why are you here?
