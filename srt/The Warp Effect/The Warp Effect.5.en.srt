1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,837
I've made up my mind to get pregnant for my girlfriend's sake.

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,777
I need you to be my husband.

3
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:08,086
Tell us right now what this dog mask is for.

4
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:09,276
Tell us!

5
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:10,857
I enjoy playing a dog!

6
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:13,596
Don't tell me you slept with one of my athletes.

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,836
I'm going to have you arrested.

8
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:17,136
I didn't sleep with him.

9
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:20,482
I want a female lead who's different.

10
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:21,442
Jean.

11
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:22,652
Do you have a boyfriend?

12
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:23,916
- No. - Good.

13
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,916
Let's hang out together sometimes.

14
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:28,367
We'll have a night out at bars, single women-only.

15
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,477
I just hope that one day you'll kiss me again.

16
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:33,676
I really miss you.

17
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:34,937
Every day.

18
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:41,517
I'm down bad, aren't I?

19
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:52,257
What the...

20
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:55,722
Hey.

21
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:56,837
Smile.

22
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,357
Smile.

23
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:00,357
Hurry up.

24
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:05,677
One, two, three.

25
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:26,357
Thitipoom Techa-apaikhun.

26
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:28,436
Yongwaree Anilbol.

27
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,846
Harit Cheewagaroon.

28
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:32,796
Ployshompoo Supasap.

29
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:34,116
Chanunphat Kamolkiriluck.

30
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,196
Apichaya Saejung.

31
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,886
Archen Aydin.

32
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,156
Pusit Dittapisit.

33
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,266
Thinnaphan Tantui.

34
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,127
Phuwin Tangsakyuen.

35
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,236
Chaleeda Gilbert.

36
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,276
Pavida Moriggi.

37
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:43,416
Pakin Kuna-anuwit.

38
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,417
Jira Charoenthamasuk.

39
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,897
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri.

40
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:09,996
From the look of it,

41
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,226
I think it's yeast infection,

42
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,896
since you also have quite a bit of clumpy vaginal discharge.

43
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:17,207
I'll give you some antifungal tablets for now.

44
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,496
Don't forget to get your HPV vaccine.

45
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:21,497
Better to prevent it than to treat it.

46
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,887
Thank you, Doctor.

47
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,986
Of course. That's all for today.

48
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:25,987
You can go home.

49
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:30,617
Doctor, actually I'd like advice on something.

50
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:32,207
But it's kind of embarrassing...

51
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:34,879
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

52
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:35,904
Feel free to ask me.

53
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,497
Well, whenever I do it with my boyfriend,

54
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:42,007
there's this issue...

55
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:49,167
It makes farting noise.

56
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,527
It makes that kind of sound.

57
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,917
I don't want him to think my thing is loose

58
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,546
or that I've been with many guys.

59
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:58,116
What should I do, Doctor?

60
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:59,987
I want it to be as tight as before.

61
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:02,016
It's nothing to worry about at all.

62
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,596
This has nothing to do with how many people you've been with.

63
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:10,127
Actually during sex, some positions may

64
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:13,786
push air into your vagina, creating an airway inside.

65
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,906
So when it releases,

66
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:16,907
it normally causes that noise.

67
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:18,877
Okay.

68
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,136
Thank you, Doctor.

69
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,536
That's it for today. You're discharged.

70
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,177
Now I can tell my boyfriend off about it.

71
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:30,917
Army.

72
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,916
Let's have coffee.

73
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:33,917
My treat.

74
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:35,677
Did you forget

75
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,677
that I don't like coffee?

76
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:40,417
Of course not.

77
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,156
I was talking about me getting coffee.

78
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,157
I'll get you some cake.

79
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,827
Don't tell me you don't like that, either.

80
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:52,697
I do like cakes.

81
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,227
That's more like it.

82
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:57,247
Come with me.

83
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:58,357
I don't want to drink by myself.

84
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,287
Alright?

85
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:02,377
Am I...

86
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:04,897
your friend now?

87
00:05:06,897 --> 00:05:08,107
Why'd you say that?

88
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:10,777
You're always my best friend.

89
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:12,602
Alright, let's go.

90
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:13,627
Come on.

91
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,279
You're... not afraid of me anymore?

92
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,537
All straight guys are wary of gay men.

93
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:35,967
They're afraid we'd want to sleep with them.

94
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,127
But I'm nothing like that.

95
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,367
Even I am picky.

96
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:42,186
It's not like I'll bang the next attractive dude who walks by.

97
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,387
It's not like that.

98
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,447
I'm not even thinking anything like that.

99
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,837
You do you, man.

100
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:52,536
I'm just worried someone might see you while you're at it.

101
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,117
It could affect your job, you know.

102
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,337
It could ruin your career.

103
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:01,957
Thanks, man.

104
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:20,827
This might be a little strange to ask but...

105
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,847
You know my memory's kinda fuzzy right now, right?

106
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,257
Do you happen to remember

107
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:29,787
how we became such good friends?

108
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:35,177
Oh, it was after that party at Jedi's.

109
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,807
You saw Joe and I kissing...

110
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,137
Joe, stop.

111
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,122
Alex!

112
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:47,147
Alex!

113
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,457
That's the beginning of everything.

114
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,547
You and Joe

115
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,886
tied me up and threw me in the trunk of a car, right?

116
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:58,887
Yeah, that's right.

117
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,987
Joe and I put you in the trunk of a car

118
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:04,247
and took you away from the party.

119
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,437
Then I took a snapshot of you.

120
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,956
I left the camera with you.

121
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,836
But I still have the photo with me.

122
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:11,797
Do you?

123
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,847
Can I see it?

124
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:22,382
Why is it this photo, though?

125
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,907
I don't remember taking a photo of you in this outfit.

126
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,467
The one I took was of you in the trunk of the car.

127
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:31,287
How did it become this?

128
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:35,967
Who exactly are you?

129
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,137
Huh?

130
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,387
Are you the Alex I know or are you not?

131
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:44,687
Wait, I get it.

132
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,347
You're Alex's twin brother who has come back for vengeance.

133
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,047
- Wait... - Where is my best friend Alex?

134
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:51,014
- Army. - Give him back!

135
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,537
Army, calm the hell down.

136
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:54,607
I have something important I need to tell you.

137
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:02,427
This is some Back to the Future,

138
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:03,814
Butterfly Effect,

139
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
Avengers: Endgame crap.

140
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,397
Are you telling me

141
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,817
you came from the past with these photos?

142
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:10,892
Yes.

143
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,537
I am the Alex from the past.

144
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:15,697
I came here after you took that photo of me.

145
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:17,647
What the fuck.

146
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:24,027
Who...

147
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,117
Who am I sleeping with?

148
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,477
I don't remember this.

149
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:29,357
Sleeping around as much as you do...

150
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:33,157
It's no surprise you don't.

151
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:35,547
Come on, Ew.

152
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:42,577
It was Ew's father that suggested that if I want to go back to the past,

153
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:45,297
I need to solve the puzzles in these photos.

154
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,247
I have to learn if I did someone wrong in the past.

155
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:49,887
Hold on a sec.

156
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,427
Why would you go back?

157
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,157
Look at you now.

158
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,267
You have everything.

159
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,827
You have the look, the job, the profile.

160
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,157
Girls are lining up to be with you.

161
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:00,847
Let's think about it.

162
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:02,437
If you go back,

163
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:03,797
you'll go back to being a loser.

164
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,697
No one wanted you. No one wanted to be your friend.

165
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,837
Why would you go back?

166
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,527
I wanted to be his friend.

167
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:13,247
A loser like me is his true friend.

168
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:14,897
Unlike a fake like you.

169
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,267
Lex.

170
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:20,597
He's the reason you can't climax ever again.

171
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,367
Nonsense.

172
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:34,707
I just can't believe you're from the past.

173
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,327
Believe it.

174
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,957
I am really from the past.

175
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:40,987
Wait...

176
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,697
Does that mean you can't remember

177
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,457
what happened between us?

178
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:49,317
Don't tell me we...

179
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:52,957
We...

180
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,477
Like hell we did!

181
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:01,277
You and I are just very good friends.

182
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:05,357
That's a relief.

183
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:06,907
But all this time,

184
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,277
you have been really nice to me.

185
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:13,597
The only reason I got through the darkest time of my life

186
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,107
was because of you.

187
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:20,047
You might not remember, but when I first came out as gay,

188
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,327
everything went to shit.

189
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:27,887
But you told me that no matter who I am,

190
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,287
or who I like,

191
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,277
I will still be the same old Army.

192
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:35,837
Holy crap.

193
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,107
Did I say something like that?

194
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:41,517
Don't you know you're very good at that?

195
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:43,757
It's all because of you

196
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:48,337
that I can be the handsome and confident Army that I am today.

197
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:50,987
Good for you, man.

198
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:55,877
Let me tell you something, Alex.

199
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,267
No matter what multiverse you are from,

200
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,867
I just want you to be yourself in every one of them.

201
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:05,287
Screw the past.

202
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:08,137
Just be happy with the life you have now.

203
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:10,867
Enjoy life, buddy.

204
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,837
Enjoy life, huh?

205
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,142
Alright.

206
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,076
Let's enjoy life.

207
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,501
Let's enjoy life!

208
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:23,946
- Let's go! - Let's go!

209
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:31,377
Go!

210
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:52,927
Keep 'em coming!

211
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,696
Here you are.

212
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,877
Drinks for two of St. Jonathan's hottest girls.

213
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:19,907
When did you guys become such good friends anyway?

214
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:21,937
I thought you were in different groups back in school.

215
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:25,447
We have something in common so it just clicks.

216
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,687
You have something in common?

217
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,437
We're both hot gilbosses with a killer career,

218
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,557
ready to have fun with no strings attached.

219
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:36,392
Okay, then.

220
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,362
Got it.

221
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,757
Enjoy yourselves.

222
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:40,797
It's Ladies' Night so knock yourselves out.

223
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:42,587
Thank you, dear.

224
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,797
Jedi's bar actually has some hot guys lurking around.

225
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,137
Good-looking and rich.

226
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,127
Perfect for you and me.

227
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,486
I'm not here for them tonight.

228
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:02,517
I'm here to have a drink with you.

229
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,397
I'm not saying we should hit on them.

230
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:06,906
We're just here to chitchat and dance.

231
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,097
Let loose, you know.

232
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:11,187
But bagging a guy would be a bonus.

233
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,597
No pressure, though.

234
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,577
Cheers.

235
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:01,372
Hi, Kat.

236
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:02,397
Hi, Jean.

237
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:06,847
I didn't know you two were friends.

238
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:12,427
Why?

239
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,007
Is it weird that we are?

240
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,347
I should be asking you what you're doing here.

241
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:20,827
It's Ladies' Night.

242
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,067
I get it now.

243
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:25,907
Looking for your next victim, are you?

244
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,877
You were pretending to be a gentleman, saying you wanted to be friends.

245
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,697
Just tell me honestly that you got sick of me.

246
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:34,697
Don't fake it.

247
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,162
Jean.

248
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:40,487
It's good you cut ties with him in high school.

249
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:56,957
Jean.

250
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,147
Let's go.

251
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,867
Kat, wait...

252
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:01,836
It's not like that.

253
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:02,837
Kat.

254
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,337
Hello, Captain.

255
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:08,717
Oh, Kat?

256
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,613
It's been a while.

257
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:10,502
I miss you.

258
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:11,557
And I miss you.

259
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,347
Who'd have thought I'd run into you here?

260
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:14,837
What a coincidence.

261
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:16,097
Is it?

262
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,697
You sure you didn't follow me here from my social media?

263
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:21,637
What do you take me for?

264
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,197
I'm not a stalker.

265
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,047
But if you want to fly with me,

266
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:28,917
call me up anytime.

267
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,027
Sure.

268
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,097
Oh, this is my friend, Max.

269
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:36,337
He's also a pilot.

270
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:37,527
Hello.

271
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,726
Nice to meet you.

272
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:39,646
Hi, Max.

273
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,482
I'm Kat.

274
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,166
This is Jean, my friend.

275
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,132
She's a film director.

276
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,617
Pretty and single.

277
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,307
Are you single, Max?

278
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:49,307
I am.

279
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:52,757
She happens to be looking for a friend to go home with.

280
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,312
Oh, yeah.

281
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,807
I'd love to have fun tonight.

282
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:02,752
Really?

283
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:05,947
I'll be your company then, Jean.

284
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,116
This is just like that time on the plane.

285
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:28,637
You mean our first time?

286
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:29,897
Yes.

287
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:32,127
I'd love to have you on board again.

288
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:33,937
Why don't you ever call me?

289
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:35,477
I'm busy.

290
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:36,757
My schedule is always jam-packed.

291
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:38,456
Let's not talk for now.

292
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,487
Let's take off.

293
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,127
Come in.

294
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:53,847
Make yourself at home.

295
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,137
Would you like something to drink?

296
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:01,047
No.

297
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:03,447
I'd rather start.

298
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,326
Wait.

299
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,327
Wait, wait, wait.

300
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,707
I just want to talk.

301
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,717
Take a seat. I'll make you a drink.

302
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,097
What's wrong?

303
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:17,317
You were giving me signs at the bar.

304
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,286
I don't want to have sex.

305
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,857
Sorry for that, but you should leave.

306
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,867
Are you checking your popularity rating?

307
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:27,147
Just having fun seducing and then bailing?

308
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:29,507
Hey, how could you say that?

309
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,106
I said I don't want sex.

310
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,107
Go home.

311
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,656
Sorry if I turned you on.

312
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:36,107
But just go home and jerk off.

313
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:37,237
Jerk off?

314
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:39,677
Stop it.

315
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:41,546
Stop.

316
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:42,547
Go home.

317
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,567
What the hell's wrong with you?

318
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,956
Go. Go home.

319
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:46,957
What, do you have PMS?

320
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:48,646
This has nothing to do with PMS.

321
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:49,886
I can change my mind whenever I want.

322
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:50,732
Go home.

323
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:51,757
Go!

324
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,447
Go!

325
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,727
It just won't come.

326
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:27,577
I told you.

327
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,277
You shouldn't have listened to Army.

328
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,127
How did that "enjoy life" crap go?

329
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,217
You listen to me, boy.

330
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,867
You should focus on your first goal.

331
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,397
Find out who was your first time.

332
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,587
If it's not Jean,

333
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,277
nor Kat,

334
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,187
then that only leaves Mollie.

335
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,147
Go.

336
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:52,887
Do it.

337
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,717
I have one question.

338
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:58,467
What does "non-binary" mean?

339
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:03,997
Well...

340
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:08,877
It's when someone doesn't want to specify if they are a male or a female.

341
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,147
Is there a problem, Siam?

342
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,807
Are you sure you want this woman to play the leading lady?

343
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:17,417
She's a nobody.

344
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,047
Who'd want to watch the film?

345
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,387
I'm an adult enough

346
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:25,787
to understand that you want to support this gender diversity thing.

347
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:28,237
But let's think of business.

348
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:30,407
Who'd want to watch this?

349
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,377
Who'd want to watch a film with a leading lady that isn't...

350
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,197
beautiful?

351
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:39,857
When it comes to beauty, I believe it's subjective.

352
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:41,397
Well then,

353
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,537
from the point of view of the director of photography,

354
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,877
she's not pretty.

355
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:46,937
And she's fat.

356
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,727
Alright. Let's all calm down.

357
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:56,057
Thank you, Siam, for your advice.

358
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:59,026
But the director already okayed this.

359
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:03,107
Jean's got fresh and progressive ideas for this.

360
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:08,507
The target audience is also teenagers.

361
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:13,836
Young people want to see some diverse representation of themselves.

362
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,837
Do they?

363
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,417
I'm just so sure this will flop.

364
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:23,077
I just can't imagine how we would make this... kid look pretty on camera.

365
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:29,297
I don't feel like I want to put her in my frames.

366
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:31,967
I'm not against this, though.

367
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,097
I can quit.

368
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:38,127
But I think that decision is up to the investor.

369
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,617
They requested me, after all.

370
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,067
I'm an award-winning cinematographer.

371
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,807
That mouth ain't winning no crap, apparently.

372
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:49,947
Well...

373
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:54,077
We should mull this over.

374
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,757
- It still... - It's nothing to mull over.

375
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,221
There should be no problem.

376
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,116
We'll meet again next time.

377
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:11,077
Hello. Mollie speaking.

378
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:16,677
The lead role?

379
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:20,717
Really?

380
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:22,777
Yes.

381
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:24,387
Tomorrow's fine.

382
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:25,707
I'm not busy at all.

383
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:28,377
Thank you.

384
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:29,246
Yes.

385
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,281
See you.

386
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:31,837
Yes.

387
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:42,757
Enough for today.

388
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,597
You already bought too much.

389
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:49,857
Look.

390
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:50,907
Come here.

391
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:55,607
They're so adorable.

392
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,726
Babe, they won't let you in.

393
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:58,907
You're too old for this.

394
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:01,066
I'm not saying I want to get in there.

395
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,237
I want you to look at the children.

396
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:04,859
They're adorable.

397
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:05,582
Look.

398
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,037
They're so bright I feel happy just looking at them.

399
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:11,287
If I had my own, I'd give them hugs and kisses all day.

400
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:14,197
Bright?

401
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,916
Where?

402
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,477
All I see is pure chaos.

403
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:20,947
Oh dear...

404
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,747
Is your heart made of ice?

405
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,947
You don't have an ounce of tenderness in you, do you?

406
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,097
I'm going to the restroom.

407
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:33,096
Stay here.

408
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:35,096
Absorb the tenderness.

409
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:35,978
Got it?

410
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:37,756
Hurry back.

411
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:38,757
Yeah.

412
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:44,277
Hey, kid.

413
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,897
Lively, aren't you?

414
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,417
You wanna go?

415
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,847
What, you wanna punch me?

416
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:55,407
I'm a boxer. Can you take that?

417
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,477
What? You gonna cry now?

418
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:04,437
Nim.

419
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,207
What are you doing?

420
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:10,867
Mollie.

421
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:14,377
It's been a while.

422
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,377
Don't be so stiff.

423
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:17,437
You used to act all friendly with me.

424
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:20,847
Well...

425
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:22,877
How are you doing?

426
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,037
What are you up to now?

427
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:28,947
I'm just... auditioning.

428
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,307
For MVs and ads.

429
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,817
Just following my dream.

430
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:38,167
Oh, but... I'll get to be in a film.

431
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:40,307
Film?

432
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,177
Congratulations.

433
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:44,797
You've always wanted to do that.

434
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,867
Thank you.

435
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:51,407
And you?

436
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:52,657
How are you?

437
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:54,312
Where's your girlfriend?

438
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:55,947
Do you have one?

439
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,087
Girlfriend?

440
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:03,127
Well...

441
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:05,947
Nim.

442
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:12,277
Bew.

443
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:15,407
This is Mollie.

444
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:18,407
We went to the same school.

445
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:22,577
I'm Bew,

446
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,167
Nim's girlfriend.

447
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:27,277
Hi.

448
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:29,677
You're an upperclassman?

449
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:31,677
You know how Nim was at school?

450
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,296
She was a pain to deal with.

451
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:37,297
It was always scary to face her when she got angry.

452
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,937
But when she was affectionate...

453
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:42,297
She was as cute as a kitten.

454
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,417
Were you?

455
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,397
It's nice running into you.

456
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:52,937
See you around.

457
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:54,497
We have to go.

458
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:47,627
You're up?

459
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:54,627
What's the rush?

460
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:56,277
Stay for breakfast.

461
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,027
I don't eat breakfast.

462
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:07,207
Do you have to rush off somewhere?

463
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,727
You're acting like you're pushing me away.

464
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:14,947
I am not pushing you away.

465
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:17,567
But I have my own rules.

466
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:20,107
What rules?

467
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:23,427
Well...

468
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:26,047
I don't want to get tied down.

469
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:28,157
I still want to have fun.

470
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,697
If you're okay with that,

471
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:33,967
I'll see you more often.

472
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,117
And if I'm not okay with that?

473
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:41,797
What do you say, then?

474
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:44,777
Are you really not?

475
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,567
Are you really not okay with this?

476
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:02,297
I am.

477
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:48,177
Is something wrong, babe?

478
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:51,277
You can talk to me.

479
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,807
It's nothing.

480
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,287
Can we just cuddle tonight?

481
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:06,617
I just want to be embraced.

482
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:11,537
Of course.

483
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:12,897
Come here.

484
00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:24,987
Babe.

485
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,967
I'm sorry about the other day.

486
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:32,347
I must have been a really awful boyfriend.

487
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:36,567
I neglected how you feel.

488
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,167
If you don't want to do that with me anymore

489
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:43,167
then it's alright.

490
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:45,807
You don't have to be my handler anymore.

491
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:49,917
Really?

492
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,067
Will you...

493
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:54,527
be okay?

494
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,417
It's fine.

495
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:10,777
Because I care more about your feelings.

496
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:17,967
I may not be the best or the richest,

497
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:23,537
but I'll do my best to make you the happiest girl in the world.

498
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:28,397
Thank you, babe.

499
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:34,027
I'm glad I kissed you that night at the party.

500
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:56,977
You want a cuddle?

501
00:29:57,737 --> 00:29:59,437
Come here.

502
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:03,177
I'll cuddle you for hours and hours.

503
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:04,967
How long do you want to do this?

504
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,897
Can we do it till morning?

505
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:10,117
To the universe and back.

506
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:16,137
I love cuddling you the most.

507
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:48,777
Look at the camera.

508
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:49,877
A little more.

509
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:55,076
Just be yourselves, but throw in a splash of sexiness.

510
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:56,467
I'm using this for the promo shot.

511
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,562
Tony, move a little closer to Mollie.

512
00:31:58,587 --> 00:31:59,686
- Sure. - Great job.

513
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:00,627
Let's begin.

514
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,527
Alright, ready?

515
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:02,527
No, we're not.

516
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:04,197
The lights aren't good.

517
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,717
It has to point upward.

518
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:07,612
Just trust me.

519
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,066
Sorry there.

520
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,586
Let's do it.

521
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:12,126
Just keep shooting.

522
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:13,876
Keep posing.

523
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:16,466
One, two...

524
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,437
Don't count.

525
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:18,606
Just let them pose. You just take a shot.

526
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:19,462
Sorry.

527
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:20,462
Alright.

528
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,257
Go on. Go on. Go on.

529
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:23,467
Okay.

530
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:24,747
Wait, stop.

531
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:26,437
Do you think this is good?

532
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:28,802
I think so.

533
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,136
- Do you? - Yes.

534
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:31,137
It's good?

535
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:32,094
Yes.

536
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,260
Which part of it?

537
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:35,727
Listen, kid.

538
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:37,246
If you want to have more lead roles—.

539
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:41,126
This is just an advice from a professional cinematographer—.

540
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:45,336
You should probably lose half of your weight.

541
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:47,136
It'll look good on you.

542
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,986
Right now, in my frame, you're just all over it.

543
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:52,066
It doesn't look nice.

544
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,050
Think about it.

545
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:54,506
Who'd want to pay to watch a film like this, right?

546
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,507
Siam.

547
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:57,477
Don't you think you're being overly rude?

548
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:00,203
Overly?

549
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:02,803
Yes, that's right.

550
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:04,193
Truly overly.

551
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,258
She's overly disproportionate.

552
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,562
She's taking up half the space in my frame.

553
00:33:06,563 --> 00:33:07,972
You wanna see it on the monitor?

554
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:10,243
You wanna see all 500 photos of this?

555
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:14,093
I told you to pick a slim leading lady.

556
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,752
It's easier on the eyes.

557
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:19,352
The leading ladies in action films gotta be slim thin

558
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:21,212
and pretty enough to excite the audience.

559
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:22,742
What year do you think we're in?

560
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:26,852
Stop using your old-world lens to judge the present society.

561
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:28,252
This has nothing to do with time.

562
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:29,452
It sells. You hear me, it sells?

563
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,302
You need to think business.

564
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,303
This is how it's been done.

565
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,702
Use your brain.

566
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:36,502
Don't use your ideology as an excuse to do what you like.

567
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:38,592
What's important here is that it sells.

568
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:40,012
If it doesn't sell then she's gonna flop. Then you're gonna flop.

569
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:41,682
But we need to try something new.

570
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:42,993
It's changed.

571
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:43,693
Changed?

572
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:44,573
We need to change.

573
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:45,433
What is there to change?

574
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:46,663
I'm going to the restroom.

575
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:17,873
Shit...

576
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,183
It's the same.

577
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:39,997
What happened?

578
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:40,643
Where's Mollie?

579
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,562
I saw them go to the restroom.

580
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:43,953
But when I came to look, they're gone.

581
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:46,183
They're not answering my call, either.

582
00:35:50,643 --> 00:35:52,202
Look around and find them.

583
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:53,522
Keep calling.

584
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:54,523
Yes.

585
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:04,853
Sorry.

586
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,792
Alex?

587
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:07,821
Mollie?

588
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:10,153
It's been a while.

589
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:11,153
What are you doing here?

590
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:13,093
I'm here to see you.

591
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,013
Me?

592
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,173
Why?

593
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,112
How do you know I'd be here?

594
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:24,643
See-ew saw your post saying you're having a photoshoot here.

595
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:29,392
I don't have a photoshoot anymore.

596
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:31,093
I'm going to quit.

597
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:33,243
What?

598
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:34,643
Why?

599
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,123
Mollie.

600
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:01,513
You can talk to me.

601
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:20,413
Thanks.

602
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:22,243
No problem.

603
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:23,953
Are you alright?

604
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:27,213
I am.

605
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:29,903
I just need a break.

606
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:33,343
Damn it.

607
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,673
I've been called fat

608
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:37,853
my whole life.

609
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,443
I really thought there was no chance for me.

610
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:46,212
This career only has a place for eye-candy people,

611
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,213
like you always see on screen.

612
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:49,713
But like...

613
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,063
can't we get just a little bit of space,

614
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:54,973
only 10% of it would be fine,

615
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:56,493
for us to just exist?

616
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:59,953
There's gotta be more people like me out there in the world, in this country.

617
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:02,069
You're right.

618
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,533
We need diversity.

619
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:04,833
Right?

620
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:07,273
And you're definitely leading lady material, I tell you.

621
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:13,293
But people are so used to slim thin pretty ladies in lead roles.

622
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,023
There's a first for everything.

623
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:25,213
I believe you could be the pioneer.

624
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,932
Someone will see the shine in you.

625
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:32,523
At least the person who chose you believes in you.

626
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,113
What have you been through

627
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:42,233
to make you understand women so well?

628
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:45,273
You're not the Alex I knew in high school.

629
00:38:47,273 --> 00:38:48,273
Well...

630
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,583
I'm a gynaecologist.

631
00:38:50,803 --> 00:38:52,083
It's my job to understand women.

632
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:56,673
You work with vaginas,

633
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:58,223
not hearts.

634
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:03,653
Well, yeah.

635
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:18,683
Can I ask you...

636
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:21,883
about high school?

637
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:24,253
Yeah?

638
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:28,783
Do you remember Jedi's party?

639
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:32,663
Yeah.

640
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,993
I kissed you.

641
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:37,142
I've never kissed a guy before.

642
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,693
You haven't?

643
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:45,213
Why did you kiss my girlfriend?

644
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,783
Why did you kiss me?

645
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:57,483
I was curious.

646
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,183
I wanted to know and try everything.

647
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:02,803
And you're quite my type.

648
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:05,863
You're a guy with a bit of a feminine touch.

649
00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:09,482
I like that so I thought I'd try it.

650
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:10,483
That's it.

651
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:16,513
Mollie, but...

652
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,902
That night, did we... sleep together?

653
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:26,253
Or was it just a kiss?

654
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:35,253
That night...

655
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:37,833
The two of us...

656
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:48,333
only kissed.

657
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:52,043
Why'd we sleep together? Are you insane?

658
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,493
Nim punched you in the face right after.

659
00:40:57,493 --> 00:41:00,103
You disappeared into the crowd after that.

660
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:02,873
I don't know what else went down.

661
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:07,693
Mollie?

662
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:20,383
I'm so sorry.

663
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:22,503
I'm so sorry he said all of that.

664
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:25,223
It's alright, Jean.

665
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:26,448
I understand.

666
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:27,523
What he said was true.

667
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:32,103
You should find someone else for the role.

668
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:34,183
I don't want to ruin your career.

669
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,243
If he quits, it'll be trouble.

670
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:38,543
No.

671
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,243
If you won't do this, then I won't, either.

672
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,623
I already chose my leading lady.

673
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:01,913
Well...

674
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:04,403
Just kinda ran into him.

675
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:06,753
He was comforting me.

676
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:13,913
Now that I know you really believe in me,

677
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,453
I'm ready to fight

678
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:20,463
and win over those assholes.

679
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:27,863
Alright.

680
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:35,493
Do you know each other?

681
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,157
You were in the same grade.

682
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:45,233
Yeah.

683
00:42:45,573 --> 00:42:46,573
But we're not close.

684
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:49,148
Let's go.

685
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:50,173
The staff are waiting.

686
00:42:52,643 --> 00:42:53,643
Thanks.

687
00:42:53,913 --> 00:42:54,913
Of course.

688
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:56,063
Good luck.

689
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:57,483
See you.

690
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:17,403
Hey, listen.

691
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:21,133
I was chosen by the investor himself to be the DP.

692
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:23,402
But I talked to the director,

693
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,302
and she doesn't freaking make sense.

694
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:28,832
She's like all about difference and diversity,

695
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,302
and this LGBTQ thing.

696
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:32,652
You get what I mean, right?

697
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,772
I accept differences, you know.

698
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:37,992
But the point is she's not pretty.

699
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,532
What leading lady is that size?

700
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,152
Think about it, man. She's just gonna put a plus size lady in the frame.

701
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,572
How are we going to crop the frame?

702
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:48,803
Like, just look, she nearly fills the entire 50mm lens.

703
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:50,233
The leading lady is bad enough,

704
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:53,713
but the male lead is just brainless.

705
00:43:55,713 --> 00:44:01,092
The director's unhappy with me.

706
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,243
And she's totally annoying.

707
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:07,453
What about me? What can I do?

708
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:19,993
Hey.

709
00:44:20,063 --> 00:44:21,563
Hey, anybody's there?

710
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:24,013
Is anybody out there?

711
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:26,303
Hey.

712
00:44:28,313 --> 00:44:29,323
Hey!

713
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:42,822
My arm!

714
00:44:42,823 --> 00:44:45,953
Hey, anybody out there? Help!

715
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:47,613
Siam?

716
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:49,243
What's wrong?

717
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:51,693
Help me get up.

718
00:44:54,643 --> 00:44:56,212
Can you really work like this?

719
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,963
Don't worry about work. Worry about me!

720
00:44:58,988 --> 00:44:59,928
Calm down.

721
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:00,983
Let's take him to the hospital.

722
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,932
Help me!

723
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:05,123
Careful.

724
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,122

00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:37,808
Jean.

728
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,552
I have something really important I'd like to talk to you about.

729
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:40,873
Is it about that night?

730
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:41,568
Yes.

731
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:42,243
(AD 2022)

732
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:43,432
Do you really wanna know?

733
00:45:43,433 --> 00:45:44,356
I'll tell you.

734
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:45,023
(AD 2011)

735
00:45:45,024 --> 00:45:46,422
You were real troublesome last night.

736
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:47,413
What do you mean?

737
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,269
He kissed three girls and a guy.

738
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:50,261
Why did you kiss him?

739
00:45:50,286 --> 00:45:52,126
I never thought you're so hot.

740
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:55,643
But now I just think you're the most interesting guy ever.

741
00:45:58,433 --> 00:45:59,643
Why are you packing?

742
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:00,973
I got suspended.

743
00:46:01,353 --> 00:46:02,353
For what?

744
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:03,663
You don't know?
