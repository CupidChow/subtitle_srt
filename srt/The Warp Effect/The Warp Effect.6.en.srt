This is some Back to the Future,

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:03,995
Butterfly Effect bullcrap.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,608
I need to solve the puzzles in these photos.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,579
I have to learn if I did someone wrong in the past.

5
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:11,861
You should focus on your first goal.

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,936
Find out who was your first time.

7
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:16,779
It was after that party at Jedi's.

8
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,235
You saw Joe and I kissing.

9
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,308
That's the beginning of everything.

10
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:27,019
Do you remember Jedi's party?

11
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:28,632
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:29,979
I've never kissed a guy before.

13
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:31,783
You haven't?

14
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,219
Why did you kiss my girlfriend?

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,410
We only kissed.

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,780
Why'd we sleep together?

17
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:43,179
Jean.

18
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:46,170
It's good you cut ties with him in high school.

19
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,779
What?

20
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,607
Siam quit?

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,477
Thank you.

22
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:58,779
That's nice. Now we can actually get some work done.

23
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,580
I'll call you back.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,982
Jean.

25
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,379
On your way home?

26
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,379
Why are you still here?

27
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,601
Did I not slap you hard enough that time?

28
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:14,379
I...

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,779
I really need to talk to you.

30
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,379
It's something important.

31
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:25,179
Is it about that night?

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,205
Yeah.

33
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:33,786
You really need to know

34
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:35,979
if we slept together?

35
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:43,179
It'll help solve the mess that is my life right now.

36
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,979
Oh, so your life is a mess because of that night?

37
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,379
Well, my life was ruined.

38
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,779
What do you mean?

39
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,179
I don't remember anything.

40
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,379
Can you please tell me?

41
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,294
How nice.

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,579
You don't remember crap while I can't forget it.

43
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,579
Okay, then.

44
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:12,602
You really want to know?

45
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:15,579
I'll tell you.

46
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,179
Now you'll know

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,179
what kind of shit you did.

(AD 2011)

65
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,897
I don't have a condom.

66
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:47,280
Just wait a little.

67
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,154
Ew.

68
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,377
You got a condom?

69
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,891
After you drink this.

70
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,982
Bottoms up!

71
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,807
You're hot when you're drunk, you know that?

72
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,207
Lemme just go and pee real quick.

73
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,237
Can you help me out?

74
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:18,602
I've never kissed a guy before.

75
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:19,602
Let me try it.

76
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,210
Alex!

77
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:25,179
Why did you kiss my girlfriend?

78
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,579
Jean.

79
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:28,797
Alex.

80
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:29,986
Did you see anything?

81
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:31,751
Of course I did.

82
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,779
I saw you two ki—

83
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,179
Jerk! What the hell?

84
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,225
Where have you been?

85
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,453
Looking for a condom.

86
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,980
We were in the middle of something.

87
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:31,878
Let's finish it.

88
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:45,580
Wait a sec.

89
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,179
Let's be each other's first.

90
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,179
Sure.

91
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:55,816
Alex...

92
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:56,853
Yes?

93
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,982
Alex, wait.

94
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:01,128
Alex.

95
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,237
Alex, stop.

96
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,385
Stop. Stop.

97
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,429
- Stop.
- What?

98
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:05,357
Stop it.

99
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:06,357
Stop.

100
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,706
- Jean?
- Alex, stop!

101
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:47,745
Let go!

102
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:48,618
Let me go!

103
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:49,801
Stay still.

104
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:51,239
Come here.

105
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:52,779
Get in there.

106
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:04,780
Congrats.

107
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:07,103
You are no longer a virgin.

108
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,380
And remember...

109
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:11,979
You didn't hear or see anything tonight.

110
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,137
Hey.

111
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:19,179
Smile for the camera.

112
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,177
One, two, three.

113
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:46,779
Let's be each other's first.

114
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,194
Sure.

115
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:13,872
Alex, stop.

116
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,051
Stop. Stop!

117
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:15,631
Stop it.

118
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,780
What?

119
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:17,992
- Jean.
- Alex, stop!

120
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:46,779
Hey, guys.

121
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,509
How are you?

122
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,324
I have a major hangover.

123
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,580
What happened last night?

124
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:56,401
Alex...

125
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,380
What's with her?

126
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:03,579
Lex.

127
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,714
Last night, you made a mess for me to clean up, you know that?

128
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,382
What do you mean?

129
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,979
I don't think I can say anything here.

130
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,180
If it gets out...

131
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,000
it'll be real trouble.

132
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,745
Come with me.

133
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,648
What the...

134
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:18,648
Come here.

135
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,808
Come on here.

136
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:21,579
We need to talk.

137
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,705
Why here?

138
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,245
It stinks as hell.

139
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:27,903
Why did you kiss Mollie yesterday?

140
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,579
I kissed Mollie?

141
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:31,416
Yeah.

142
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,772
You kissed Mollie.

143
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,779
How could that be?

144
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,042
I remember going into a room with Jean.

145
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,779
You kissed Jean, too?

146
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:44,379
But you were drinking with me.

147
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,202
I don't know.

148
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,948
I don't remember anything.

149
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,320
But I'm sure I didn't kiss Mollie.

150
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,945
If I were to kiss her, wouldn't it make more sense for me to kiss Kat?

151
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,681
You kissed them all.

152
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,179
You kissed Kat.

153
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:57,148
You kissed Jean.

154
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,309
You kissed Mollie.

155
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,980
Even Army didn't miss your long list.

156
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
Holy crap.

157
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,779
I kissed Army?

158
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:05,595
How the hell did that happen?

159
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:06,847
Well, it already did.

160
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:07,807
Come here.

161
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:08,807
Wait, what?

162
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,927
I kissed Army?

163
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,383
Crap. Spicy news.

164
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,180
Alex kissed three girls and a guy.

165
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,320
(St. Jonathan's Baddest (34))

166
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,010
(Y'all, I got news!!! Alex made out with three girls and a guy last night.)

167
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,090
(What? Who? Not my girlfriend, I hope.)

168
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,930
(Kat, Mollie, Jean.)

169
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,330
(Who's the guy?)

170
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,210
(Freaking Army!)

171
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,810
(Alex banged a girl at Jedi's?)

172
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,650
(Three girls, I heard. That was sick!)

173
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,450
(At once?)

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,290
(That's what they said.)

175
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:37,650
Don't you do anything anymore.

176
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,450
You hear me?

177
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:38,891
Huh?

178
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:39,828
Yeah.

179
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:41,979
Just be normal like everyone else.

180
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:48,653
Ew.

181
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:52,004
Why is everyone looking at me weird and then whispering?

182
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,004
Alex.

183
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,179
You ain't as boring as you look, man.

184
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,579
Heard you were juggling three and one last night.

185
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,765
What do you mean, three and one?

186
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:02,380
Oh, don't play it down.

187
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,779
You can't fool me anymore, tiger.

188
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,780
Tiger, my foot.

189
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,438
What the hell, nerd?

190
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,438
You're one of us now. Welcome—

191
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:12,397
Hey.

192
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,379
Welcome to the gang.

193
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:16,779
Hot guys stick together, you know.

194
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,437
How the hell did you do it, though?

195
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:22,234
Kat, Jean, and then Mollie?

196
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:23,367
You kissed Army, too, didn't you?

197
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:23,979
Lex...

198
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:25,179
Love the flexibility, dude.

199
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,179
You're the man, you know?

200
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:44,530
Come here.

201
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,634
Hold on, Army.

202
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,591
What are you doing?

203
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,921
You gonna punch me? I fight back, you know.

204
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:50,449
Do you realise that you kissed me last night?

205
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:53,324
Now everyone thinks we're a thing.

206
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,309
I didn't know myself.

207
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,580
I was drunk.

208
00:12:58,782 --> 00:12:59,979
You were drunk?

209
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,579
So you don't remember anything from last night?

210
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:04,888
Yeah.

211
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:06,746
Not a thing.

212
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,979
Except one thing.

213
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,426
What is it?

214
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,029
You and Joe...

215
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,520
Me and Joe what?

216
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,654
What?

217
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,527
You and Joe put me in the trunk of a car.

218
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:22,742
Why'd you do that?

219
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,234
It took me ages to get out of there.

220
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:26,379
I was screaming for help like crazy.

221
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,179
I needed to teach you a lesson

222
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,579
for kissing my Kat.

223
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,056
But it's alright now.

224
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,411
Kat's cool with it.

225
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:49,179
So I think you and I can probably be friends.

226
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:53,980
Why would someone like you suddenly want to be my friend?

227
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:56,426
Well...

228
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,979
You're cool, man.

229
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:02,379
I don't think you should stay with your loser friends.

230
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:05,552
You're at the top now.

231
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,908
It's only natural that we should stick together.

232
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:10,779
You know what?

233
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,979
From now on,

234
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,379
my matter is your matter.

235
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:19,179
And yours is mine, too.

236
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:21,653
What do you say?

237
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,380
Welcome to the club, Alex, my best friend.

238
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,120
Hell yeah.

239
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,040
Army, my best friend!

240
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:43,265
Alright, buddy!

241
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,579
Let's go.

242
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,579
What you looking at?

243
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:48,623
You got a problem?

244
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:49,931
I'm Army's buddy, dude.

245
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,580
Wanna go?

246
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:00,607
Why did you kiss him?

247
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,149
Why did you do it?

248
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,779
Was it to get my attention?

249
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,179
Why do you think everything's about you?

250
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:10,480
I kissed him because I wanted to.

251
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:13,295
I wanted to know what it feels like to kiss a guy.

252
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,022
I tried it and now I know that it's not for me.

253
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,336
That's it.

254
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:17,386
So?

255
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:18,459
Are you gonna try everything now or what?

256
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,379
Well, can't I?

257
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,720
I don't know what I like.

258
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,600
Am I even actually a lesbian?

259
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:27,582
The world doesn't have an answer for me.

260
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,928
So I'm just one of your experiments?

261
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:32,797
Huh?

262
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,951
If you realise one day that this ain't it, are you gonna break up with me?

263
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,951
But that's not all this is.

264
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:40,311
Right now, I'm with you, and you're a girl,

265
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,773
so I like girls.

266
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,706
But in the future,

267
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,579
if I discover that I like men,

268
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:50,151
or gays, or butches, or trans,

269
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,579
it can change.

270
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,182
I get it now.

271
00:15:57,002 --> 00:16:01,179
Do you ever think that we're just waiting to break up?

272
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,579
I always have to wait for you.

273
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,263
I have to gamble if you'll change your mind,

274
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,983
or like someone else, or start liking guys.

275
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,779
You ever think of that?

276
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,379
What do you want me to do?

277
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,869
Are you yourself 100% sure you like girls?

278
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,182
Yeah.

279
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,779
I guess some people just freaking know.

280
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:22,283
Good for you, then.

281
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,057
Congrats on finding yourself early on.

282
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,579
But for me,

283
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:28,779
it's gonna take a while.

284
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:34,914
Well, if that's the case,

285
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:37,179
what's the point of dating

286
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:39,579
if we're just going to break up in the end?

287
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,382
I don't know anymore.

288
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,405
Forcing this would only waste our time.

289
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:56,379
You won't understand anyway.

290
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,288
Okay.

291
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Alright.

292
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,979
Then you can be on your own.

293
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,579
I'd rather be with someone who's sure who they are and wants a future with me.

294
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:12,395
Nim.

295
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,379
Nim, wait.

296
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:26,379
Army?

297
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:28,925
Army.

298
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:33,579
Army.

299
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,979
Kat.

300
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,564
Why are you in here?

301
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,160
This is a boys' restroom.

302
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,782
I need to talk to you.

303
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,155
Let's talk outside.

304
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,007
We'll do it here.

305
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:47,241
You kissed Alex last night.

306
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:48,502
What does that mean?

307
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,065
He was drunk.

308
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,979
So he kissed me.

309
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,173
It was a miracle I didn't punch him in the face.

310
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,241
Yeah?

311
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,408
Did you kiss anyone else?

312
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,401
You know what, Army.

313
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,007
I'm starting to think that you and I

314
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,779
aren't on the same page anymore.

315
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:14,379
You probably know what you like.

316
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:19,179
Sleeping with you once is enough to make me know this isn't right.

317
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,779
So here's the deal.

318
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:27,579
Let's go our separate ways and enjoy the kind of lives we choose.

319
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,450
Wait...

320
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,561
Are you...

321
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:32,785
Are you breaking up with me?

322
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,779
What's the point of keeping going?

323
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,579
We should just enjoy our lives.

324
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:41,977
Do whatever we want.

325
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,617
Wait.

326
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:49,539
Kat.

327
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:16,823
Are you alright?

328
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:20,379
You heard everything, didn't you?

329
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,709
Yeah.

330
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,980
I heard it all.

331
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:25,856
So are you okay?

332
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:29,805
It's a relief.

333
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,379
I always know we don't get along.

334
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,743
The only thing we have in common is our pretty faces.

335
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:35,789
But well...

336
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,789
A part of me is hurt.

337
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,374
Being rejected hurts

338
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:45,579
because no one has ever said no to me before.

339
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,525
Not arrogant at all, are you?

340
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:50,525
I'm going home now.

341
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:52,779
Let me know if you need my help.

342
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,580
Hold on.

343
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:01,179
Can you help me with something?

344
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,979
With what?

345
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,008
Well...

346
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:14,379
Help me the same way you did at the party.

347
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:16,777
Hell no.

348
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:18,607
Someone might walk in.

349
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:33,019
Now no one can see us.

350
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,970
Keep quiet.

351
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,805
What the hell are you two doing?

352
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,586
Joe, what the hell?

353
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:23,979
Why did you get in here with me?

354
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:27,579
You have a crush on me?

355
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:29,979
Asshole, I trusted you.

356
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,180
(How many girls do you think Alex banged at the party?)

357
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:51,345
(Three.)
(More than three.)
(Zero. He's just lying.)

358
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,920
(Definitely three.)
(I think he's a liar.)

359
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,370
(Heard he actually got like 10.)
(Ooh, sexy. My turn next.)

360
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,411
Hey.

361
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:00,811
Sir?

362
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,456
We have to talk.

363
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:03,580
About what?

364
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,389
About what everyone's talking about right now.

365
00:22:05,414 --> 00:22:06,701
About you.

366
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,579
They said you slept with three girls at once.

367
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,354
Is it true?

368
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,277
Did you have an orgy?

369
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,446
No.

370
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,065
It's nothing like that.

371
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:21,005
Did you use protection?

372
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,179
Don't tell me you didn't.

373
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:28,244
I told you in class, didn't I?

374
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,831
I said not to knock them up.

375
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:32,145
There will be trouble.

376
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:33,579
You're still young, too.

377
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:37,284
If the Student Discipline Office finds out you get someone knocked up,

378
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:39,005
you could be expelled from school.

379
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:10,881
Wait, wait, wait.

380
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:11,979
Why are you celebrating?

381
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:15,102
I'm happy for you.

382
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:19,179
My grandson is all grown up now.

383
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,579
I heard you bagged three chicks last night.

384
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:23,866
Where did you hear that?

385
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:24,739
It's not true.

386
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,948
No need to be humble.

387
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,779
It's something to be happy about.

388
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:34,069
Ice told me everyone at school said you slept with three girls

389
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,017
and even kissed one guy.

390
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:37,545
Oh, no. It's not like that.

391
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:38,909
Don't listen to Ice.

392
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:39,679
What?

393
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:40,903
Don't look at me.

394
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,682
Gramps asked me how school was so I told him.

395
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,579
You're popular now, aren't you?

396
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:47,980
So how was it last night?

397
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,877
Did you enjoy yourself?

398
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:53,979
I don't know.

399
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,179
I don't remember anything.

400
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:58,780
Did you use a condom?

401
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,875
I don't want history to repeat itself, you know.

402
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:05,881
Repeats itself?

403
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,782
Whose history?

404
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:09,220
Dad's?

405
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,299
Do you mean...

406
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,047
Dad and Mum had me when they were teenagers?

407
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:12,758
No.

408
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,136
I was talking about myself.

409
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:16,306
I was a free spirit.

410
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:18,420
I loved everyone equally.

411
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,379
So sometimes mistakes happened.

412
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,180
You seem to be living your best life now.

413
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,165
No studying and all that.

414
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:29,979
Just let Dad leave all his expectations on me, then.

415
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,379
Well, when's your turn, kid?

416
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,780
Gramps, I'm 13.

417
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:19,179
Well, stay gone.

418
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,579
What do I need to keep wearing it for?

419
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:27,210
I'm not a virgin amymore!

420
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:48,191
Hold it.

421
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:50,509
What?

422
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:52,331
Lex.

423
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:53,765
Why are you all buddy-buddy with him?

424
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:56,379
Did you forget he's your bully?

425
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,608
He stashed you in the trunk of a car.

426
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:01,179
Hey, the past is in the past.

427
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:04,779
Alex and I are best friends now.

428
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:07,180
We know everything about each other.

429
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,779
And we keep each other's secrets.

430
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:11,979
The hell you babbling about?

431
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:12,946
Oh, you ass...

432
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,915
Wait, wait.

433
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,534
But See-ew is my best friend.

434
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:20,087
No, buddy.

435
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:22,087
You're the new Alex now.

436
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:25,179
Who you choose to surround yourself with is very important.

437
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:26,645
Look.

438
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,004
A friend like this will only ruin your image.

439
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,580
The new Alex needs to have everything.

440
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:34,779
Listen to me.

441
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:35,979
Your look,

442
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:37,179
your image,

443
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:38,908
and everything has to be perfect.

444
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:40,779
And See-ew?

445
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,477
No can do, my friend.

446
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,477
Get rid of him.

447
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,930
(Short Film Club)

448
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:03,106
Alex.

449
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:05,405
Oh, Kat?

450
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:06,996
Are you here to see someone?

451
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,464
You.

452
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:12,557
Me?

453
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,352
Why?

454
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:16,234
Do I need a reason to see you?

455
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:19,754
That's not what I meant.

456
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:23,979
I just... you didn't normally care about me before.

457
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,780
I didn't think you'd be so hot, either.

458
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:32,379
But now I think you're just the most interesting guy ever.

459
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:39,577
Really?

460
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,505
What about Army?

461
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,319
Army's found his way.

462
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:45,580
Don't worry about him.

463
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:49,177
Does that mean...

464
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,579
You're going to date me?

465
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:52,954
Date?

466
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:54,009
Aren't you funny?

467
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,810
I know you want me.

468
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:00,005
I do, too.

469
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,579
So let's make a fair deal.

470
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,979
If sex is good,

471
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,379
we can be friends with benefits.

472
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:11,979
Banging with no strings attached.

473
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:14,379
Be each other's booty calls.

474
00:28:14,988 --> 00:28:16,165
Isn't that nice?

475
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:22,779
What do you say?

476
00:28:24,146 --> 00:28:25,179
Well...

477
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,420
if you say no,

478
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:28,804
I would understand.

479
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:30,605
I won't make you.

480
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:34,659
Alright.

481
00:28:34,684 --> 00:28:35,894
I'm in.

482
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:37,805
Let's start now.

483
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,062
Liu, what are you doing?

484
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:11,977
You playboy!

485
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,779
You know,

486
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,179
I'm not mad that you slapped me.

487
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:39,691
I liked it.

488
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:43,788
Are you insane?

489
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,579
Who likes getting hurt?

490
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,380
Well, I'm weird like that.

491
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:52,779
Not everyone can accept that.

492
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,379
I guess

493
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,779
I'll be alone my entire life.

494
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:03,579
No way.

495
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:08,906
Someday you'll find someone who will accept you for who you are.

496
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,979
People have different tastes, you know?

497
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,007
You'll meet your soulmate.

498
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:20,909
Well...

499
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:26,380
Can you accept a weird guy like me, Liu?

500
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:32,425
Can I have one?

501
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:42,450
It's too windy to light.

502
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,404
Can I have the one in your hand?

503
00:31:58,162 --> 00:31:59,979
I didn't know you smoke.

504
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,429
Sometimes.

505
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,711
When it gets too stressful.

506
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:07,871
Let me guess.

507
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:10,539
Are you thinking about what everyone's saying

508
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:11,982
about you and Alex

509
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,275
at the party that night?

510
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:20,379
Did you guys really do it?

511
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:25,254
Yeah.

512
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,060
Really?

513
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:35,979
Come on.

514
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:39,582
Don't pay any mind to what people say.

515
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:43,179
It will become yesterday's news tomorrow.

516
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:45,109
Will it?

517
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:49,180
Everyone's already decided I'm a slut.

518
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:51,579
I'm the girl who takes her shirt off and dances on the table.

519
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,491
And also...

520
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:55,180
Alex's first bang.

521
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:57,579
So?

522
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,179
Is that wrong?

523
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,579
I dance on tables shirtless all the time

524
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,602
and people have been calling me a slut.

525
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,253
But honestly.

526
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,407
If all you do is care about what everyone's saying about you,

527
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:13,179
you'll never start living.

528
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,179
Don't let a single guy ruin all the opportunities to have fun in your life.

529
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:24,077
You're pretty, you know.

530
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,777
So take advantage of it.

531
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,615
Oh, look.

532
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,374
She was acting like a model activist,

533
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:56,208
but turns out she just wants attention.

534
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,239
True that.

535
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:58,353
If she didn't want to be famous,

536
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,270
she wouldn't have slept with Alex and posted this here.

537
00:34:00,295 --> 00:34:02,488
- True.
- Look at that.

538
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,090
(ALEX'S PLAYTHING)

539
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
(HAWT)

540
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,179
Who put these here?

541
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,780
Why would anyone do this?

542
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,179
What are you looking at?

543
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:18,853
You did this?

544
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:20,404
No. Someone sent me that.

545
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:25,179
But like... is that really your boob?

546
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Delete it!

547
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,979
It's my freaking phone.

548
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,208
Give me.

549
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:32,694
Didn't they say she's easy?

550
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:33,694
What a moody witch.

551
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
(HAWT)

552
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,970
(WILD!)

553
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
(EASY A!)

554
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:46,499
Oh!

555
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,004
What a disgrace.

556
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:53,979
I know it's my face. But I didn't put it there.

557
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:57,008
I don't care if you did or not.

558
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,748
But it has always seemed like you love attention.

559
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:02,602
You wouldn't start protesting for stuff otherwise.

560
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,205
That was bad enough.

561
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,979
But doing this is just brainless.

562
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,182
Teacher...

563
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:11,038
I didn't think someone was filming when I took my shirt off.

564
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:13,179
It's because you don't love and cherish your body in the first place.

565
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,179
Love and cherish my body?

566
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,779
Whatever it is,

567
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:25,179
no one has a right to use my photos to do that.

568
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:28,967
I already have to put up with those boys making fun of me.

569
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,179
And none of what they said is true.

570
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,579
Rumours are rumours.

571
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:35,979
If you're not who they say you are,

572
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:37,804
just ignore it.

573
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:40,779
I'm the victim here, you know.

574
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:45,112
Why does it sound like

575
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,780
you're not even trying to protect me?

576
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:47,979
Whatever it is.

577
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,379
The teachers will discuss this.

578
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,231
But one certain thing is

579
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:53,979
there will be punishment.

580
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:09,579
Jean.

581
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,531
How are you?

582
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:15,579
I haven't seen you since the party.

583
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,746
We were both drunk that night.

584
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:23,715
I had a major hangover the next day.

585
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,309
And when I got to school,

586
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,779
all I heard about was something I have no memories of.

587
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,087
You heard any of that?

588
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,687
Yeah.

589
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:40,870
Do you know what happened to me?

590
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:44,379
Not at all.

591
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,207
Why are you packing?

592
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:53,522
I got suspended.

593
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:55,085
What?

594
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:56,379
Really? What for?

595
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:03,579
Don't say you don't know.

596
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,979
How dare you say you don't?

597
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,348
What?

598
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:09,672
If you didn't tell everyone that we slept together,

599
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:11,979
no one would even want to know about me.

600
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:14,377
And then no one would want to post those photos

601
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:17,410
of me dancing in a bra on the wall!

602
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,648
Jean, wait.

603
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:20,380
I didn't tell anyone about this.

604
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,502
I don't know how that got out.

605
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:23,502
How could it not be your doing?

606
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,179
We were the only two people in that damn room.

607
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:29,979
What? Is sleeping with a virgin so praiseworthy?

608
00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:31,777
It's not fucking climbing the Everest!

609
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:33,715
Why'd you tell everyone about it? I don't get it.

610
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:34,779
Jean, calm down.

611
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:37,684
Tell me what you need me to do.

612
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:38,854
You want me to debunk the news?

613
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:40,779
- I really didn't...
- It's too late now!

614
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:44,379
You happy now?

615
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:50,379
You happy being the popular playboy?

616
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:51,579
What does that make me?

617
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,779
Just an easy girl who gets up on the table dancing and seduces men.

618
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,580
In the end, my name will go down only as the first girl you screwed.

619
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,380
Jean.

620
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,410
(AD 2022)

621
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:21,697
Hello, Ew?

622
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,013
I know what happened at Jedi's now.

623
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:26,379
Jean told me everything...

624
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,407
every messed up thing I did.

625
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,379
Ew. What do I do?

626
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,779
What can I do to make her forgive me?

627
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:36,912
I need to go back and fix everything.

628
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:37,737
Tell me what to do, Ew.

629
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:38,954
Lex.

630
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:39,802
Calm down and listen to me.

631
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:42,044
I have something to tell you.

632
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,576
What?

633
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,779
Mollie's photo is back to normal.

634
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:49,179
What do you mean?

635
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:51,579
I don't know how you did it,

636
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,943
but I think you just solved Mollie's issue.

637
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:56,382
You're heading in the right direction.

638
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,979
Now you have to solve the puzzles in every other photo, too.

639
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,346
Then you can go back and fix what you did that goddamn night.

640
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:07,180
Then you can reach the finish line during sex again.

641
00:41:07,394 --> 00:41:09,008
This isn't just about sex.

642
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:15,579
I'll fix everything and change Jean's life.

643
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,179
This means we have every photo.

644
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:52,782
And you also know that your first time was with Jean.

645
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:55,091
Alright.

646
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:58,779
The pattern of your time travel is much clearer now.

647
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:02,379
When you solve the puzzle, the photo goes back to normal

648
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,337
to what actually happened at the party.

649
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:05,979
Once you solve every single puzzle,

650
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:08,379
you will be able to orgasm again

651
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:10,779
or you might even go back to the past.

652
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:14,379
I think we're at the right place.

653
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,400
But I think I know now

654
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:21,579
why Jean lied to me the first time about sleeping with me.

655
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:25,182
She must be really angry and hate me.

656
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:38,936
You need to do whatever it takes for Jean to forgive you.

657
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:41,979
I think Jean is the key to all of this.

658
00:42:57,717 --> 00:42:59,980
Jean, wait.

659
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,379
Why are here?

660
00:43:03,202 --> 00:43:04,918
I'm sorry I came to see you where you live.

661
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:07,295
But can you at least listen to me?

662
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:11,979
I'm not here to make excuses.

663
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:13,905
I'm here to admit my mistakes.

664
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:15,672
That night was my fault, Jean.

665
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:21,680
You do realise that admitting your mistakes or not,

666
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:25,179
my feelings towards you won't change?

667
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:26,937
Jean.

668
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,192
I'll do whatever you want me to.

669
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:30,222
Can you please forgive me?

670
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:32,031
You think this is easy to forget?

671
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:33,577
No, I get it.

672
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:38,379
I get it. That's why I'm feeling so guilty and want to apologise.

673
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:39,579
It was my fault.

674
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,979
It was all my fault. I'm sorry.

675
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:44,435
Can you forgive me?

676
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:51,579
You were drunk that night.

677
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,005
So was I.

678
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:57,579
So it was my fault, too, you get it?

679
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:00,608
So we shouldn't meet again.

680
00:44:01,546 --> 00:44:04,529
Ever since that day, I've been trying to start over with someone new.

681
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:07,179
But every time, I get flashbacks from that night.

682
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,579
Do you know how torturing that is?

683
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,654
Just try to understand.

684
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:16,480
Jean, I'm sorry. It was my fault.

685
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,982
Jean.

You're gonna be the father to her child?

688
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:52,170
Nim, wait.

689
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:52,983
Stop.

690
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:54,115
Stay still.

691
00:44:54,162 --> 00:44:58,112
What position you take isn't just about your body.

692
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,878
This has nothing to do with being a top or bottom.

693
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:02,379
I just don't like it.

694
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:03,604
Be my girlfriend.

695
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:09,579
Bark for me.

696
00:45:09,862 --> 00:45:11,402
I'm going all the way.

697
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:15,579
Liu.
