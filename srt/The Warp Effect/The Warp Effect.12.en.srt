1
00:00:00,695 --> 00:00:03,700
Saran...is your biological father.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,101
Was it an instant camera?

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,006
Alex, wait.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:13,300
If you get her to kiss you, the curse will go away.

5
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:16,322
Give me another chance.

6
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:20,500
I thought I could forgive you, but I can't.

7
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,374
I got pregnant.

8
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:26,166
there's only one way.

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,703
Go back to the past.

10
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:29,889
Maybe you might change something.

11
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:31,334
Can you keep this camera?

12
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:38,503
Can I take a photo of you with this camera?

13
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,100
I'm back.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
I am back!

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,500
I'm really back.

16
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:58,900
Gramps, Gramps, Gramps!

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm home, Gramps!

18
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:01,716
- Alex. - Gramps.

19
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:02,947
Alex, what's wrong?

20
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:04,282
Where are you "back" from?

21
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:06,783
I thought I'd never see you again, Gramps.

22
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:08,504
I'm literally hugging you here, aren't I?

23
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:10,900
I ain't dead, kid.

24
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,300
You really aren't dead.

25
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,153
You're in the flesh.

26
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,901
Oh, Gramps!

27
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:18,337
Gramps...

28
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:20,121
What's with you?

29
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,563
Hey, listen to me.

30
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:23,119
I'll do the dishes.

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,224
You should go lay down and take a rest.

32
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:26,500
Alright, just go.

33
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:29,036
Alex.

34
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:29,971
What's wrong with you?

35
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,424
Hurry up and go to the party.

36
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,392
It's alright.

37
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,158
I'll go after I finish doing the dishes.

38
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:35,515
You should sit down and rest, Gramps.

39
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:36,492
Just chillax.

40
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:38,500
Or...

41
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:40,716
You can go watch porn, like usual.

42
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:43,587
Get your heart pumping and stay strong.

43
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,633
So you can live a long life.

44
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,168
You knew?

45
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:49,615
Gramps, our walls are this slim thin.

46
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:51,158
I hear everything.

47
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,100
Just go and rest. I'll do the dishes.

48
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,335
I am back!

49
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,725
Ice?

50
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:01,793
Ice!

51
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,515
Oh, sh—

52
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,926
You don't need to hide it.

53
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:11,678
I know you're playing guitar behind Dad's back.

54
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:12,728
How'd you know that?

55
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,214
I'm your big brother.

56
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:15,700
You can't hide anything from me.

57
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:20,500
But what you played just now...

58
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:21,700
that was great.

59
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:26,500
What's with you, barging in here and licking up my boots?

60
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:28,321
It's nothing.

61
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:30,100
I just want to tell you that

62
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm proud of you.

63
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:39,122
Listen.

64
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:43,300
You don't need to do what Dad wants you to.

65
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:46,325
The two of us don't have to become doctors.

66
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,678
You wanna be a rockstar?

67
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,500
Go and be it.

68
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,660
One day, my little brother here will become a legend.

69
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,885
What are you saying?

70
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,300
You're delusional.

71
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:06,906
Hey, just... If you want to go to that party, just go.

72
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,503
I won't tell Dad.

73
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm not delusional.

74
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,164
I meant what I said.

75
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:18,100
If anything ever comes up, you know you can always tell me.

76
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:21,703
I love you, Ice.

77
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,300
Believe me when I say that

78
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:33,700
one day you'll be a good father.

79
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,949
When the time is right, that is.

80
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:39,187
Come here.

81
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:39,855
Bring it in.

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,556
It's been a while since I last hugged you.

83
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:42,730
Come on.

84
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,700
My little brother.

85
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,278
Nice.

86
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,935
I have to go.

87
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:56,500
There are so many things I need to fix.

88
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,442
Sure...

89
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,301
Love ya.

90
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:03,054
Yeah...

91
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:06,969
What is wrong with him?

92
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:08,500
Who the hell wants to be a father?

109
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,033
Ew.

110
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,842
Ew, Ew, Ew.

111
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,500
Oh, Ew!

112
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:26,500
You look so much better when you're young, man.

113
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,100
What the hell?

114
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,802
You're late and you're being weird.

115
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:31,700
Look at that.

116
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,289
Jedi's already drunk.

117
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:42,100
Oh, damn.

118
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,433
Ew, can I try something?

119
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,900
Smile.

120
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,526
What?

121
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,183
Stand there.

122
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:48,875
You want a photo?

123
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,500
- Yeah. - Alright.

124
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,491
Okay. In one, two, three.

125
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,046
Lemme see.

126
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,359
Do I look good?

127
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,701
It's showing up.

128
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,774
The photo's showing up normally.

129
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:04,464
Oh, Ew.

130
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,100
I'm back, Ew!

131
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,654
Oh?

132
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:08,799
What's with you?

133
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm back, Ew.

134
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,759
The photo's showing up normally.

135
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,100
Hey, Ew.

136
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,700
You like Liu?

137
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,107
Who wouldn't like her

138
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,700
when she's so pretty?

139
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,728
I guess so.

140
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,300
Why don't you go talk to her?

141
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:32,673
What are you babbling?

142
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,966
You know she's way out of my league.

143
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,100
Ew.

144
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,100
Trust me.

145
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
You're freaking cool.

146
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:41,315
Go.

147
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:42,103
Go what?

148
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:42,766
Go talk to her.

149
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:43,886
No.

150
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,698
- I'll go with you. - Lex, no. Please.

151
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:46,562
Lex. I'm begging you.

152
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:48,109
Lex, Lex, no.

153
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,704
Please. Don't. Please?

154
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:50,501
Trust me.

155
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:51,915
Let's go.

156
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:52,903
No, Lex.

157
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:54,903
Lex, no.

158
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:59,463
Liu, this is my friend, See-ew.

159
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:02,500
He's had a crush on you since forever.

160
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,901
He loves deeply and is genuine.

161
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:10,469
He may have this... unusual interest that is unlike anyone else.

162
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,100
But you will be fine with it.

163
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:15,531
He's affectionate and cute.

164
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,878
Just think of him as a dog.

165
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:19,472
Lex!

166
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,919
You comparing me to a damn dog?

167
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,389
Oh, come on.

168
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:24,851
You will understand one day.

169
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:27,352
And you... take good care of her, alright?

170
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:29,233
You always only ever do what you want, you know that?

171
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,018
Now go take care of her.

172
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:31,953
Lex? What the hell, man?

173
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,421
Just talk to her.

174
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,366
I'm off.

175
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,100
I'll leave my friend in your care.

176
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,415
- Alright. - What the hell?

177
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,329
Lex, why'd you take that?

178
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:59,442
You two hardly ever share such a sweet moment like this,

179
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,374
of course I'd snap a shot to commemorate that.

180
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:02,498
Hello, Mollie.

181
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,623
Hi there, Alex.

182
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,123
It's been a while. You look amazing.

183
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:07,043
You jest, surely.

184
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:09,073
It's you who look amazing.

185
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:09,925
You got yourself a girlfriend?

186
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:12,098
As if someone like him ever would.

187
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:14,500
He's a celibate.

188
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,728
Watch your mouth.

189
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,301
He can still have a girlfriend even if he's keeping his virginity.

190
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,405
You can date or love someone without having sex, you know?

191
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,100
True that. That is my thought exactly.

192
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,426
And hey, you two...

193
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:28,900
You gotta play nice, alright?

194
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:29,934
Alright?

195
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:36,100
Mollie, Nim here may be bossy and bitching about things sometimes,

196
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,701
but honestly...

197
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,658
She's just being protective of you.

198
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:40,898
Nim, you.

199
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:42,817
You need to compromise from time to time.

200
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,368
You two have been dating for ages.

201
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:47,532
When you guys are fighting, just take a step back.

202
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:50,500
If all you do is keep marching forward, you'll ruin this, you hear me?

203
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,900
Give Mollie a compliment every so often, too.

204
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:56,500
Relationships need space to work.

205
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,038
Hold on, Alex.

206
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,038
What have you been on?

207
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,427
That was freaking inspiring.

208
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,103
Not unusual coming from me, no?

209
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:08,497
Oh, Mollie.

210
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,472
One more thing.

211
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:14,500
Mollie.

212
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:16,700
That doesn't make you feel anything, right?

213
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,719
Alex...

214
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,775
You!

215
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,498
Nim!

216
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:21,509
Easy there, Nim.

217
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:22,900
Nim. Mollie.

218
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,300
Mollie, you're freaking sexy.

219
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:26,898
You just need to be confident in yourself.

220
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:30,026
One of these days, you're going to be a film star.

221
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:34,476
You, with your body and your face, are so damn pretty and so damn sexy.

222
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:35,386
Repeat after me,

223
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:37,679
"I'm beautiful. I'm beautiful. I'm beautiful."

224
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,135
I'm beautiful.

225
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:40,002
I'm beautiful.

226
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:42,206
Can I take a photo of you right now?

227
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,941
It's going to be hard to get to you in the future.

228
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:45,153
So lemme take one now.

229
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,153
One, two, three.

230
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,303
There.

231
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:56,975
Oh, the photos...

232
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,389
The photos are normal.

233
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,337
They are normal.

234
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,795
Mollie, the photos are normal.

235
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,155
Nim, the photos are freaking normal.

236
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:05,940
The photos are damn normal.

237
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,039
The photos are normal!

238
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:10,307
The photos are normal!

239
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,928
You definitely ain't.

240
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:17,838
What was that?

241
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,165
Army.

242
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,700
I've missed you.

243
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,384
- Oh, how I've missed you. - What the hell, Virgin Boy?

244
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,805
I just want to tell you that...

245
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,534
I like that you can always be yourself.

246
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:51,128
Just tell who you love honestly that you love them.

247
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,515
You care about them a lot.

248
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,500
And love isn't all about sex.

249
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:57,701
You hear that, Joe?

250
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:02,323
Sex doesn't only mean... penetration, you see.

251
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,900
You can enjoy it on the outside, too.

252
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,761
The hell are you spouting?

253
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:08,940
Who's penetrating who?

254
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,458
I'm telling the truth.

255
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,806
You'll understand one day.

256
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,658
- Understand what? - Trust me, you two.

257
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,202
Homo now, are we?

258
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:15,947
You jerk...

259
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:16,863
Come here.

260
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,781
- Come. - Hey, hold on.

261
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,575
Just believe me, guys.

262
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:20,500
I mean it.

263
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,901
That was so gay, man.

264
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,903
One, two, three.

265
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:32,978
Bye-bye.

266
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:34,119
Bye-bye.

267
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:47,083
Help!

268
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:47,965
Help!

269
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:50,017
Army, let me go!

270
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:51,815
Let me go!

271
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,005
I still haven't taken all the photos.

272
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,041
Let me go!

273
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,041
I need to take the photos.

274
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,301
Army, you jerk.

275
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,701
For Jean!

276
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,700
It's normal!

277
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,216
Hey, you there, get away from her.

278
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,990
Get your hand off.

279
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:47,184
Don't touch.

280
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:48,823
Kat, let's come down here.

281
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:50,500
What, Alex?

282
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,651
Do you like me or something? Why're you so protective?

283
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:54,624
Huh?

284
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:55,581
No.

285
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,156
I just want to tell you something.

286
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:58,811
You want to enjoy life, right?

287
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,429
You should go for it.

288
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,421
But you need to learn some kind of martial art.

289
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,870
Because there are some assholes like these guys

290
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,855
who don't know how to respect women's decisions.

291
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,402
I don't know what you're saying.

292
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:11,572
But thanks...

293
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:12,901
Mr. Hot Nerd.

294
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,137
Can I kiss you?

295
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:26,187
Jean?

296
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:27,251
Jean, wait.

297
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,718
It's not what you think.

298
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,097
Hang on.

299
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:31,298
Nerd, snap a shot.

300
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,125
Alright.

301
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:36,098
Okay. One, two, three.

302
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,300
It's normal.

303
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,316
Oh, you two.

304
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,100
Don't forget to get vaccinated against HPV.

305
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,300
What the hell's an HPV?

306
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,701
Is that a superhero name?

307
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,768
No. HPV is a disease.

308
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,350
But guys don't have to get vaccinated for that, right?

309
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,300
HPV is a disease and it's infectious in any genders.

310
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,904
And practise safe sex if you're going to do it,

311
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,300
whether with your lover or... someone else.

312
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:10,900
So you won't have to argue who gets it from who.

313
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:12,581
What does that mean?

314
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:13,489
Are you seeing someone else?

315
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:14,141
What?

316
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:14,904
No.

317
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:15,534
Tell me right now.

318
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:16,500
Why'd he say that otherwise?

319
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,544
Babe, there's no one else.

320
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:18,285
Tell me!

321
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:18,860
There's no one.

322
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,913
- Swear it. - That nerd was freaking lying.

323
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:21,727
Come back here, you nerd!

324
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:23,190
Hey.

325
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,421
Heard you bought a vibrator.

326
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,898
Don't you wanna try the real thing?

327
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,620
What a waste.

328
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,464
Yeah.

329
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,900
You're a girl. What's the fun in doing it alone?

330
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,935
If you want to finish, you need a man's help.

331
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,700
Isn't that right?

332
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:43,946
Enough, you lot.

333
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:45,971
If she wants to masturbate,

334
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:47,565
what does that have to do with you idiots?

335
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,131
You might not even be able to make them girls orgasm.

336
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:52,900
Not everything is about dicks.

337
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,126
There are way more things that work better than a penis.

338
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,441
You hear me? You hear me? You hear me?

339
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,886
He's right.

340
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,341
My pussy, my choice.

341
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:01,626
You got a problem with that?

342
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:03,565
We're just joking.

343
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:04,648
Y'all too serious.

344
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:05,681
Joking, aren't you?

345
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:09,156
Then is it okay if I make fun of your dick, then?

346
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:12,368
Burn!

347
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,666
Let's just go.

348
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,060
What's with you two?

349
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:19,583
Get out of here.

350
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:26,198
Thank you, both of you.

351
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,198
It's okay.

352
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:31,300
Jean, wait.

353
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:32,932
Hold on to this.

354
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,996
Jean.

355
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:36,103
Jean, wait up.

356
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:50,187
Jean.

357
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:51,843
That just now...

358
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,725
I didn't mean to kiss Kat.

359
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,300
She kissed me because she was drunk.

360
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,928
Whether you kiss her or not is none of my business.

361
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,500
It's not, yeah, but...

362
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,731
I care about you.

363
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:09,129
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

364
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:15,698
Here.

365
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:16,900
Drink up.

366
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,100
And I'll stop being mad at you.

367
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,334
All of these?

368
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,475
More?

369
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:34,332
Good job.

370
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,298
Let's go dancing.

371
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,697
Come here, kid.

372
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:01,934
Jean...

373
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,704
I...

374
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,100
I need to puke.

375
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,900
Be right back. I need to pee.

376
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:42,532
Hey.

377
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,500
Nat, my man. You can't get in.

378
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,882
This room's... under renovation.

379
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:46,926
Go take a leak over there.

380
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,576
- What the hell? - Go. It's being renovated.

381
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,701
Just let a man take a piss, dude.

382
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:09,998
Hey, you guys.

383
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:10,950
Stop it.

384
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,100
I said stop it.

385
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:13,864
Stop. Stop. Stop.

386
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,980
Stop recording.

387
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Stop it. All of you.

388
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,098
Stop it.

389
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,333
Don't you dare.

390
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,359
Give me your phone.

391
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:21,827
Delete it.

392
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,870
Delete what?

393
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,941
The photos you took just now.

394
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,298
Give it to me.

395
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,378
Here you go. All done.

396
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:35,263
Don't do it again.

397
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:37,808
Someone could get expelled for that, you know.

398
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:39,546
You guys hear me?

399
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,248
Delete it.

400
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:41,448
Did you delete it already?

401
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,301
Delete all of it.

402
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:53,529
Let's go find something fun to do.

403
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,300
What now, Jean?

404
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,386
Let's go.

405
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,703
What were you doing up on that table anyway?

406
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,098
Careful now.

407
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:08,500
Slowly. You're gonna fall over.

408
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,103
What are you doing, Jean?

409
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:13,301
Take a snapshot of me.

410
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:16,900
Put your shirt back on and I'll do it.

411
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:20,580
No way.

412
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,276
Just take one of me like this.

413
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:23,510
Jean.

414
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,166
I'm stripping if you won't take it.

415
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:25,746
Okay, fine.

416
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll do it.

417
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,704
Keep your clothes on.

418
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:31,298
Alright.

419
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:34,269
One, two, three.

420
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:44,500
Jean.

421
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:53,399
Jean...

422
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,300
Want me to be your first time?

423
00:20:58,129 --> 00:20:59,054
No, I'm not actually in a hurry for that.

424
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:01,956
But I am so ready, you know.

425
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,057
No.

426
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:04,900
You're not ready.

427
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,306
You're really drunk, do you realise that?

428
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,900
I don't want you to do something you'll regret later.

429
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:15,556
I want our first time to be special,

430
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,556
with both of our conscience intact.

431
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:22,518
But I am super ready tonight.

432
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,500
Jean?

433
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:40,341
Jean?

434
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,500
Alex's been acting like he's possessed.

435
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,079
Ever since yesterday, that is.

436
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,084
He came running into my embrace, telling me he loves me.

437
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:00,856
Really?

438
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,639
He did that to me, too.

439
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:02,611
Oh?

440
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:03,704
All done, you guys.

441
00:23:03,704 --> 00:23:04,904
It's here.

442
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:08,500
Your usual fried eggs and sausages.

443
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:09,734
Shall we eat?

444
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:10,901
Hey, Ice.

445
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,900
Eat lots. These are all good for you.

446
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,909
You need to eat for your brain.

447
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,550
It'll help you study better.

448
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,326
Okay?

449
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:20,501
And you, Dad, you should eat a lot of veggies.

450
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:23,686
You need to watch your cholesterol

451
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:26,500
and don't forget to have regular check-ups, alright?

452
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:29,817
You, Gramps, need to exercise more.

453
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:31,817
You need to stay fit and strong all the time.

454
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:33,880
Actually, why don't the four of us

455
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:36,124
go have an annual health check up together?

456
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:40,233
So our Four Wheels family can stay together a really long time.

457
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:41,858
Eat loads, everyone.

458
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:43,300
Let's dig in.

459
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,392
Why are you still here?

460
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:03,617
I'm waiting for you.

461
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:04,898
Hurry up.

462
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:06,098
Wait for me?

463
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:06,571
Yeah.

464
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,501
You don't have to. Dad will give me a ride.

465
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:10,753
I'll give you a ride.

466
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,300
I'll even take you to a guitar store after school.

467
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,961
You in?

468
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:14,975
Really?

469
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,331
Yeah.

470
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,300
And hey, I won't tell Dad about this.

471
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:23,682
This is a secret between us, the Rear-Wheel Brothers.

472
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:24,786
Okay?

473
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,949
Are you really my brother?

474
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:30,741
It's like you came from another dimension or something.

475
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:31,432
Yeah.

476
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:36,867
I travelled through time to make you a rockstar.

477
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:39,227
Alright. Jump on.

478
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,901
You're crazy.

479
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:42,101
Hey, start the engine for me.

480
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,298
Oh, sorry. I forgot to turn on the ignition.

481
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,900
Now that's my brother, alright.

482
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,443
That's more like it.

483
00:24:58,094 --> 00:24:58,897
You ready?

484
00:24:59,002 --> 00:24:59,726
Just go.

485
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,301
You sure you're ready?

486
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:03,698
Let's go.

487
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:06,101
Through the time dimensions!

488
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,900
Hello, Ew.

489
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,098
Hello, Nim.

490
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:26,098
What are you doing?

491
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:27,141
What got into you?

492
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,526
What got you so lovey-dovey with us all of a sudden?

493
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:34,329
I'm just glad the three of us are best friends again.

494
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:35,706
Wait, wait.

495
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:37,300
What's with you?

496
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,670
We've been best friends all this time.

497
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,792
Nim doesn't share the sentiment, though.

498
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,768
She's still mad at you about Mollie.

499
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:44,500
What?

500
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:45,947
I'm so sorry.

501
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,275
I did it for you, you know.

502
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:49,633
I needed to prove to you

503
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,261
that you and Mollie will get through every obstacle together.

504
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:57,652
And one day, you and Mollie will be a family, and then you'll have kids.

505
00:25:57,652 --> 00:25:58,900
What?

506
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,535
What are you babbling about? Family? Kids?

507
00:26:01,535 --> 00:26:03,700
I hate children. How could I have kids?

508
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,726
One more thing, Mollie and I are both girls.

509
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:11,266
I will be your sperm donor.

510
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:13,301
You don't need to ask Army for it.

511
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:14,616
Eeew, Alex.

512
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:15,272
What the hell are you saying?

513
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,202
I'm going to throw up.

514
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,415
No way.

515
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:19,300
What does Army have to do with this?

516
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:21,700
Lex.

517
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,771
Are you okay?

518
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:27,395
I think something's wrong with your brain cells.

519
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,553
I'm fine.

520
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:32,498
Let's say that, if the day ever comes,

521
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:34,900
you can ask me for help.

522
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,300
I love children.

523
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:43,009
Oh, Ew.

524
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:44,292
How was it with Liu?

525
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,143
Did you start barking at her?

526
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:48,100
Lex, I'm not a dog.

527
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:50,500
You will be one day.

528
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:53,049
Are you out of your mind?

529
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,298
- What's wrong with you? - What is wrong with you, Lex?

530
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,700
What the hell got into him?

531
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,608
Hey, come here.

532
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:16,166
What, Alex?

533
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,555
Did I not teach you a lesson last night?

534
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:19,303
What? What will you do to me now?

535
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,321
Gonna throw me in the trunk of a car again?

536
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:25,925
I'll do even worse

537
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:30,100
if you don't shut up and walk away in 10 seconds.

538
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:32,263
Only 10?

539
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,042
10.

540
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:34,946
Guess I can't make it in time.

541
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,101
Nine.

542
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:37,297
Eight.

543
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,483
Seven.

544
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:39,701
Six. Five, Four, Three—

545
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,574
I know about you and Joe.

546
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,753
What do you know?

547
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:45,698
Whatever it is, keep your mouth shut.

548
00:27:46,427 --> 00:27:47,878
Hey, easy there, man.

549
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:51,018
I'm not threatening or blackmailing you.

550
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,692
I just... want to warn you.

551
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:56,907
I saw you and Joe at the party.

552
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:59,159
I don't mind it, but if someone else has seen it,

553
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,100
they might talk.

554
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,700
And that's going to be a problem for you two.

555
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:07,950
You can do whatever you want.

556
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:10,898
You don't even need to tell anyone who you are.

557
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:12,729
Just wait until you're ready.

558
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,700
Are you sure

559
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:24,100
that you won't tell anyone about this?

560
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,439
Why would I?

561
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,283
Other people's sex life is none of my business.

562
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:29,568
Why'd I poke my nose in?

563
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,230
But I have to say...

564
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,900
You need to work things out with Joe early on.

565
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,500
Not everyone's fine with anything like you.

566
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,721
Good luck.

567
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:44,821
Baby.

568
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:46,362
Idiot, wha—

569
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:09,701
Hi, Jean,

570
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:19,300
I have a question.

571
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:21,233
Yeah?

572
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,993
What happened last night?

573
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:26,030
Everything just cut to black.

574
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:28,326
Last night?

575
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:32,589
After saving Blossom, you made me drink so much.

576
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:38,146
You were drunk yourself.

577
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:41,515
You were so drunk you got on a table and started dancing,

578
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:42,783
not to mention taking off your shirt and throwing it.

579
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,168
What?

580
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,027
Did anyone have that on their phone?

581
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:48,707
Of course. They were recording the whole thing.

582
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,159
But don't worry.

583
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,728
I made them delete all of it.

584
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,698
I got lucky there.

585
00:29:57,698 --> 00:30:00,101
If that got out, the Principal would have killed me.

586
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,698
Then what happened?

587
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:07,140
And then we...

588
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:09,732
We also...

589
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:14,063
We banged?

590
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,701
No.

591
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,061
We just...

592
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,098
We just made out.

593
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:21,700
Well, we almost did it.

594
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,849
But you passed out drunk first.

595
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:27,703
That was embarrassing.

596
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,300
I can't believe I could get that drunk

597
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:33,701
It's okay now.

598
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:37,300
I stayed with you the whole night.

599
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:42,336
You got up all confused in the morning.

600
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:44,144
And then you...

601
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,695
just left.

602
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:50,501
But I swear on my honour, I didn't do anything to you.

603
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,175
Hey, now. What did you do?

604
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:57,076
Be honest. Did you do anything?

605
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,101
Actually, I...

606
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:02,501
What did you do, Alex?

607
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,712
What?

608
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:07,301
I didn't do anything. I just...

609
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,701
What did you do?

610
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:12,100
I stared at you the whole night through.

611
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:16,706
When you were passed out drunk and just snoozing like that...

612
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:18,106
I think it was cute.

613
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,067
Liu, what are you doing?

614
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:44,018
You playboy!

615
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:00,097
Hi, Liu.

616
00:32:01,934 --> 00:32:02,823
Yeah.

617
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:08,820
About what happened last night at the party—

618
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,701
Stop.

619
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,085
I just want to say that—

620
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,454
Don't say anything.

621
00:32:12,454 --> 00:32:13,128
But I just want to tell you that—

622
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:15,128
I said don't say anything. I'm embarrassed, okay?

623
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,301
What are you embarrassed about?

624
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,900
Kissing someone like me?

625
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,898
Is it so bad that it's me?

626
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:33,129
Is that why you can't tell your friends we kissed?

627
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,146
Just look at us.

628
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,703
We're too different.

629
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:46,897
It's never going to work.

630
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:51,255
Our friend circle, our interests, and what we like...

631
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:52,900
We have nothing in common.

632
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:56,501
How'd you know that?

633
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,898
Maybe...

634
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:01,915
If you date me,

635
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,937
you might get to know something more about yourself.

636
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,423
And...

637
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:09,701
Don't let anyone else's words

638
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,100
ruin your happiness.

639
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,383
Wow.

640
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,321
That's some strength from someone her size.

641
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:00,101
Babe.

642
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:01,997
You gonna just let them beat us?

643
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:03,606
Nope.

644
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:32,047
Army, what the hell?

645
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,019
Someone could see you.

646
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:34,329
Screw them.

647
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,098
Joe.

648
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,502
I think I'm ready now

649
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:40,428
to tell people we're dating.

650
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:43,299
Are you sure?

651
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,508
You're not afraid people might talk?

652
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,566
What about Kat?

653
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:49,844
Hey.

654
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,699
Kat has her own way.

655
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:54,099
And I have mine.

656
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:57,699
I think life is too short to pretend to be someone I'm not.

657
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:02,498
Right?

658
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:14,502
What do you think you're doing?

659
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:16,899
I'm doing what you like.

660
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,923
Whenever I do it,

661
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,684
you always give in to anything I want.

662
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,299
Only 'cause you know all my weak spots.

663
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:27,704
Just on the outside, though.

664
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:31,924
Yeah.

665
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:46,902
Get in.

666
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,102
Be quite.

667
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,260
Mr. Saran.

668
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:22,899
Oh, Alex.

669
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,101
What is it?

670
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,301
Wait a sec.

671
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,326
I heard you were at Jedi's party last night.

672
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,099
Be careful.

673
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,074
Use protection.

674
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,314
Don't worry.

675
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:36,039
I always play safe when it comes to this.

676
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,554
Kudos, kid.

677
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:38,499
What do you need to talk to me about?

678
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:42,099
It's... nothing.

679
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,299
I just want to tell you that...

680
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,899
Whatever you're feeling right now,

681
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:54,729
it's time to move on from it.

682
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:58,568
I think the person from your past

683
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,709
doesn't have anything to worry about anymore.

684
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,625
They probably already forgave you.

685
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:10,899
Oh, and...

686
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,491
If you're not too busy, let's go take some photos together sometime.

687
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,724
Here.

688
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:34,430
You sure you know what you're doing?

689
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,101
You're not helping.

690
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:38,845
Go stand there.

691
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:39,702
Okay

692
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:43,299
Let a pro photographer handle this.

693
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:44,936
Do it.

694
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:45,699
That's nice.

695
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,751
(Short Film Club)

696
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,056
Finally.

697
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,723
Good thing we got everything we wanted done in a day.

698
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:40,941
It's good, but it's a bit lonely.

699
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:44,207
I don't know if we will see each other again after we graduate.

700
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:48,099
The older we get, the more responsibility we have.

701
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:52,321
It's not strange to forget about someone we've made great memories with.

702
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:56,501
Will you... forget about me, Jean?

703
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:01,299
How will you remember me?

704
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,104
I think I'll remember you...

705
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,699
as someone who helps me out with the yearbook.

706
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:10,902
What?

707
00:40:11,014 --> 00:40:12,099
That's it?

708
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,882
I want to be something more.

709
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:15,701
Alright, alright.

710
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,902
I'll add something.

711
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:21,619
I'll remember you as someone who looked after me when I was drunk,

712
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,494
who told others off for

713
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,923
taking videos of me drunk-dancing, half naked on a table,

714
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:33,159
someone I passed out drunk in front of.

715
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,621
Okay, then.

716
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:38,499
Those are all very nice things to be remembered by.

717
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,724
How will you remember me?

718
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:45,699
Me?

719
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:51,699
I'll remember you as the most talented girl I know.

720
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:54,074
I'll remember you as the one

721
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:56,523
who fights for what's right and for other people.

722
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,518
I'll remember what a bad drunk you are,

723
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:03,699
though I have to admit it's mostly adorable.

724
00:41:06,537 --> 00:41:08,501
I'll remember...

725
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,899
how much I like you.

726
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,299
I like that. Those are all good things.

727
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,299
But I want us to make more good memories, too.

728
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:32,499
Make more good memories like what?

729
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:36,101
Like at that party...

730
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:39,132
I feel like something's missing, like it's unfinished.

731
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:44,896
Shall we be each other's first time?

732
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:50,354
Do you mean it?

733
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:51,701
Of course.

734
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,825
It's time to take this ring off.

735
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:20,498
Oh, Jean. Jean, Jean.

736
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,899
Jean.

737
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,347
I'm coming, Jean.

738
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:25,058
Jean!

739
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:36,037
Alex.

740
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,120
What's with that face?

741
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
We're at the premiere, you know?

742
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,377
The premiere of what film, again?

743
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:41,787
Our film.

744
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:42,561
Ours?

745
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,499
What, you don't remember?

746
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:48,099
You filmed it. I wrote and directed it.

747
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:52,901
What's wrong with you?

748
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:55,998
Jean. Alex.

749
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:57,121
Come over here.

750
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,139
Everyone's waiting for a snapshot.

751
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:58,902
Let's go.

752
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,102
Alright, everyone.

753
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:02,961
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

754
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:04,306
Congrats, you two.

755
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:06,102
Thanks.

756
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:07,929
Congratulations.

757
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:09,701
Mollie, over here, please.

758
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:12,493
Congratulations.

759
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:18,102
You're a full-fledged film star now.

760
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,501
I am so damn proud of you.

761
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:23,929
Well, you're the film star's girlfriend.

762
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:25,299
I'm proud of that, too.

763
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,477
Move closer.

764
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,480
Sorry.

765
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:31,826
It's alright.

766
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,207
You can move a little closer.

767
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:36,098
Babe, come on.

768
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:36,880
Come here.

769
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,775
I'm nervous.

770
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:38,976
I've never been to such a fancy event before.

771
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:40,410
Don't be, baby.

772
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,642
Let's smile for some photos.

773
00:43:41,642 --> 00:43:42,762
Stay close.

774
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:47,385
Hey.

775
00:43:47,385 --> 00:43:48,745
Come closer.

776
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:50,108
Let go.

777
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:50,594
It's alright.

778
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,701
Hurry up.

779
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:55,233
Oh, babe?

780
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,499
Come forward.

781
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:57,156
The camera's this way.

782
00:43:57,156 --> 00:43:58,558
Stay up front or they won't get you in the shot, you small thing.

783
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:00,729
Thought you weren't ever going to notice me.

784
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:04,901
Oh, you're embarrassing me.

785
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:06,099
How envious I am.

786
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:22,899
I'm happy everything's back to normal.

787
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:24,785
What?

788
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:26,154
What was that?

789
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:29,049
Please, stay close.

790
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:30,783
One, two, three.

791
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:54,916
Oh, wait.

792
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:55,505
Excuse me.

793
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:57,698
Can you please take one photo with this instant camera?

794
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:00,102
No, you can't.

795
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:01,692
What? Why not?

796
00:45:01,692 --> 00:45:02,625
No!

797
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:03,862
But this is mine!

798
00:45:03,862 --> 00:45:06,099
No, you can't!

799
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:15,051
