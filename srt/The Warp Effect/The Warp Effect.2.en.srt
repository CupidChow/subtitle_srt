1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:01,894
I'm holding a party tonight at my place.

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,078
See y'all there!

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,173
There's something for you.

4
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:05,048
An instant camera?

5
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:05,616
Should we try it?

6
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:07,513
One, two, three.

7
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,684
Ew, you got a condom?

8
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,411
Help me out and I'll help you.

9
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:16,814
Lex, stop it!
Bottoms up!

10
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:17,730
You wanna pass out or something?

11
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,121
Congrats.

12
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,518
You are no longer a virgin.

13
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,327
One, two, three.

14
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,430
Doctor, is everything alright?

15
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,518
What the hell!

16
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:45,923
Mum?

17
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:46,866
Mum.

18
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,688
Mum, what are you doing here?

19
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,343
What's happened to me?

20
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:52,170
Mum, help me.

21
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,442
Alex.

22
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:57,047
Do you remember what you promised me when we were here?

23
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,069
Promise?

24
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,119
I don't remember anything.

25
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:04,718
I don't even know how I got into this lab coat.

26
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:06,776
The ring.

27
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,316
Where is the ring?

28
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:09,734
Ring?

29
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,247
I don't know.

30
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,118
I don't know where it's gone.

31
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:14,008
I really don't know.

32
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:14,919
I swear I don't.

33
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,044
I don't know where it's gone.

34
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:17,044
Alex.

35
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,845
Why didn't you keep your promise?

36
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:21,961
You said you'd wait.

37
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,081
Mum, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:24,679
- You said you would wait.
- I'm sorry.

39
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:25,473
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:27,547
Mum, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:29,027
Alex.

42
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:31,753
Let me take a photo of you.

43
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,400
Mum, don't.

44
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,027
Don't.

45
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:35,858
Mum, stop it!

46
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,883
Mum!

47
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,842
Are you ready for your pelvic exam,

48
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,518
baby?

49
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,647
What the hell are you doing, Army?

50
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,518
What's with you?

51
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,247
Did you have a nightmare?

52
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,347
Hold on.

53
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,241
Where is this place?

54
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,318
How did I get here?

55
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:27,518
What the hell am I wearing?

56
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,143
What the shit?

57
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,143
Calm down.

58
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,318
You passed out while you were working.

59
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:36,546
I told you to take a rest every once in a while.

60
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:42,469
Ever since becoming the most famous and popular gynaecologist,

61
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,995
you never seem to want to take days off anymore, do you?

62
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,047
Hold on.

63
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,718
I'm-I'm a gynaecologist?

64
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:54,447
Of course.

65
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,183
You're the expert on the female body.

66
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:59,793
The best in the country.

67
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:04,721
What the hell? You're being weird.

68
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:07,118
Did you knock your head when you passed out?

69
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,461
Come here. Let me see.

70
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,718
Turn this way. Look at me.

71
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,718
What the hell are you doing?

72
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,918
Stop it.

73
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,140
I'm just tuning you back to earth.

74
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:23,203
What? You never mind that I kissed you before.

75
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,690
One time when you were drunk,

76
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,381
we even...

77
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:30,785
made out.

78
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,898
- Hell no...
- You don't remember that?

79
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,036
Stop it.

80
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,181
Stop this right now.

81
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,206
You and I are not friends.

82
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,843
I would never kiss you anywhere.

83
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:46,633
Is that so?

84
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,212
Really, really?

85
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,176
I've got photos and videos to prove otherwise.

86
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,779
Here.

87
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,178
Dr. Army.

88
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:57,379
Your patient is waiting.

89
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,301
Alright.

90
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,708
I'm back to work.

91
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,004
Take care of yourself, babe.

92
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,199
You hear me? I'm worried about you.

93
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:07,834
What the hell!

94
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,778
Aren't you out of it today?

95
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:12,714
Bye, then.

96
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,006
- Just leave me alone already.
- I'll come again.

97
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,006
Thanks.

98
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:22,293
You two are always so close.

99
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,452
The nurses actually think you're dating, you know.

100
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,721
Shit.

101
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:30,978
What's happened to me?

102
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:34,676
Is this a dream?

103
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:47,206

- You betrayed me.

157

Whose Dad?

175
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,178
My Dad or yours?

176
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,778
Yours, of course?

177
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:03,427
Mine?

178
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:08,178
Ice.

179
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,006
What are you wearing?

180
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,504
Who's this woman?

181
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:16,090
What the hell?

182
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,501
Have you been away so long that you forgot Kim?

183
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:22,578
My girlfriend's lived here for five years and you came home less than five times.

184
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:24,944
Wait a minute.

185
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:28,567
Maybe it wasn't me he met each time he was here?

186
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:32,178
Ah, great. Now you're wrecking my relationship.

187
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,327
Of course not.

188
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:39,378
Dad.

189
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:41,778
I didn't know you still knew your way home.

190
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,178
Will you stay for lunch?

191
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:48,600
It's nothing fancy, though. It's always just me eating at home.

192
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:52,576
Ice and Kim always have dinner after their gigs before coming home.

193
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,176
Come home more often.

194
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,379
I miss you.

195
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,579
Let me help.

196
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:27,381
Dad.

197
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:28,578
Where's Pops?

198
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:31,655
Why isn't he joining us?

199
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:38,181
You miss Grandpa?

200
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,212
If you do, why don't you go live with him?

201
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:42,978
Where does he live now?

202
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,178
Over there.

203
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,378
What happened?

204
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,607
He just gave me a hug before I went to the party.

205
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,978
What is this?

206
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,907
What actually happened?

207
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:38,399
(Do Not Enter, You Traitor!)

208
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,276
(Eistein Foto)

209
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,301
Ew.

210
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,301
(Eistein Foto)

211
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,597
Ew.

212
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,310
Ew!

213
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,412
Stop right there.

214
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,508
Ew... There's something I have to tell you.

215
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,581
Did you not see the sign outside?

216
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,548
Take another step,

217
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,178
and don't say I didn't warn you.

218
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:04,390
Are you really going to shoot me?

219
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,441
Is that a challenge?

220
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:06,696
No.

221
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:08,176
I loved you like a brother.

222
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,487
And you ditched me.

223
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,487
Don't do it, Ew.

224
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:12,629
Just go to hell.

225
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:13,904
- Ew, no!
- Traitor!

226
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,576
No!

227
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:18,290
Ew!

228
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:18,982
Ew, stop it!

229
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:19,612
Stop!

230
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,055
Look at this.

231
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:21,684
Ew, take a look!

232
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,821
Just look!

233
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,982
Stop it and just take a look!

234
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,030
What the hell?

235
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:40,336
Where did you get this?

236
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,781
Why am I being arrested in this?

237
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,778
Are you ready to listen now?

238
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,367
So you're telline me that this camera

239
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,378
was the reason you travelled ten years in the future,

240
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:05,778
you woke up as a gynaecologist,

241
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:10,489
and these photos are telling us what's going to happen soon?

242
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:11,489
Yes.

243
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:15,376
Do you think there's a scientific explanation for this?

244
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:17,304
Well, shit.

245
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:21,378
If it wasn't for these photos, I'd never believe you.

246
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,978
This is more unbelievable than any films Christopher Nolan ever did.

247
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:30,994
Wait a minute.

248
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,641
Maybe you're an astronaut who came here through a wormhole?

249
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:39,375
Wait a minute.

250
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:42,684
Maybe you travelled here in a DeLorean.

251
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,576
Wait a minute.

252
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,978
Maybe you walked through a mirror to another dimension.

253
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,721
How can this camera be a time machine?

254
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:00,978
I just can't come up with anything.

255
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,007
Me neither.

256
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:15,591
I think...

257
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,806
We need to consult a scientist who's an expert on this.

258
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:22,677
And who's that?

259
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,181
Your Papa?

260
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,240
Is he even a scientist?

261
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,978
Papa might as well be the specialist consultant for the film Interstellar.

262
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,505
Who gave you this?

263
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,379
All I remember is that

264
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:54,976
my grandpa told me someone left a box on my doorstep.

265
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,378
When we opened it, this thing was inside.

266
00:17:57,804 --> 00:18:00,978
When I used this camera at the party,

267
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,378
weird things happened to me.

268
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,379
So you don't know who this belongs to?

269
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,689
I don't.

270
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:14,178
I thought it was a gift so I just took it.

271
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,544
I think there's something fishy about this camera.

272
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:24,978
It just appeared out of the blue.

273
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:31,607
And you said the photos it produced are something you've never seen before.

274
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,378
From the way I see it,

275
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,178
these photos look like they're telling you something.

276
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:40,971
What are they saying?

277
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,017
And how should I know that?

278
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,578
It's your job to look for that answer yourself.

279
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,412
These photos

280
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:56,178
may be some kind of puzzle that you need to solve.

281
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,206
But why me?

282
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:00,951
What did I do to deserve this?

283
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,904
Why does God punish me so?

284
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,778
According to some superstition,

285
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:08,178
when something peculiar like this happens,

286
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:15,284
it's most likely because of curses or broken promises.

287
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,778
Have you ever promised someone something and broke it?

288
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,206
Be careful.

289
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,874
This is serious business for people in the olden days.

290
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,778
They think someone who breaks promises will only face adversity.

291
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,779
Could it be my mother?

292
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,803
I did dream about her talking about that promise.

293
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,978
You mean that promise about not having sex until 18?

294
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,382
But I didn't break that promise.

295
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,016
I haven't slept with anyone.

296
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,307
You have, though.

297
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:56,178
You're not a virgin anymore.

298
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,401
You lost your virginity at Jedi's party. You don't remember that?

299
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,176
I—

300
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,108
I'm not a virgin?

301
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:06,867
Who did I sleep with?

302
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:07,650
I don't remember anything.

303
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,121
Who didn't you sleep with?

304
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:11,778
You had a long line of plaintiffs from that night.

305
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,178
The whole school was talking about it.

306
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,107
I'll believe you.

307
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,467
And I'll help you.

308
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:27,378
But I'm keeping this photo of me.

309
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:28,664
Why?

310
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,979
I need to solve the puzzle in that one, too.

311
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,412
Just solve mine later.

312
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:38,412
Solve the other ones first.

313
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,578
Let's start with Nim's.

314
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:42,396
You haven't seen her, right?

315
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:45,378
I'm not sure if she will ever believe any of this, though.

316
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:48,978
How has she been, by the way?

317
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,600
I'll take you to her.

318
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:59,778
But... I'm not taking any responsibility for your safety, man.

319
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,978
Just know that Nim isn't the same as she was.

320
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:14,807
What do you mean?

321
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,578
You'll find out soon.

322
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Ew, wait up.

323
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,578
Ew.

324
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:25,713
Harder!

325
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,550
Hey.

326
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,216
That's Nim.

327
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,378
She's the manager of this gym now.

328
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:34,787
Harder.

329
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:37,145
Do it again!

330
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,378
Harder!

331
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:40,773
Cool.

332
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:46,945
Hey.

333
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:50,944
Hey.

334
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:52,578
Stop what you're doing.

335
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:54,976
Ew.

336
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,176
Why are you taking him here?

337
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:58,407
Calm down.

338
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:01,372
Lex has some complicated mystery he needs to tell you.

339
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:02,689
I don't care.

340
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,204
I'm not listening to a traitor like him.

341
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,178
What did I ever do to you?

342
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,507
Hey, listen up.

343
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:24,978
Throwing a mean punch means you gotta feel it.

344
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:28,578
Emotions like hatred and malice

345
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:32,178
really add a boost to your punch.

346
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:35,778
And today I've got a new punching bag for you all.

347
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:41,333
I want you to put all your hatred and malice into your punches.

348
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,604
Show me what you can do.

349
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,399
You're real cool.

350
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,770
Ew?

351
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,110
Wait.

352
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm the punching bag?

353
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,178
Yes, you are.

354
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,173
I'm outta here!

355
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:07,487
Follow him!

356
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,821
Hurry up!

357
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:09,594
Faster!

358
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,087
Go!

359
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,244
- Get him!
- Nim.

360
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:13,566
- Get his ass!
- Nim!

361
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,699
Nim!

362
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,230
Calm down.

363
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,499
Lex travelled through time from the past.

364
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:20,470
He came to me, showing me some photos—

365
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,207
Ew.

366
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,496
Listen to me first.

367
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,603
He showed me some photos.

368
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:24,889
Yours was among it.

369
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:26,676
Once you see it, I'm sure you're going to be stunned.

370
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:27,676
Ew.

371
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:32,178
I can't believe you will still take him back after what he did to us.

372
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,686
Get him!

373
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:36,976
Hurry up and get him!

374
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:38,274
Go!

375
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:39,388
- Go!
- Lex!

376
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:40,793
Folow him!

377
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:41,520
Faster!

378
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,569
Do we have to do this?

379
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:43,647
- Lex!
- Go!

380
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,333
Where the hell has he gone?

381
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,978
I think he's outside.

382
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:57,378
Just wait till I see you again.

383
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,144
I'm gonna kill you dead.

384
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:00,447
Let's go.

385
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:09,381
Ew.

386
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:10,847
Over here.

387
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,418
I tried explaining everything to her.

388
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,753
But she wouldn't listen.

389
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,950
Sit down.

390
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:19,867
Why didn't you tell me she's mad at me?

391
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:22,102
I didn't know she would be this mad.

392
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:24,684
What is she so angry about?

393
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,179
Why is everyone mad at me?

394
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,430
You don't remember stealing her girlfriend?

395
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,604
You don't remember kissing her girlfriend?

396
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:34,898
Are you talking about Molly?

397
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:35,898
Who else?

398
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:40,720
What the shit!

399
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:46,102
Easy there.

400
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,464
Listen to me.

401
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:50,810
I think for now you should just live your life to the fullest like usual.

402
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:53,269
I'll help you with this time travel mess.

403
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,007
How can I live my life to the fullest

404
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:03,252
when the entire world hates me right now?

405
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,578
Where can I even live?

406
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:05,917
Your condo, maybe.

407
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,239
My condo?

408
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:09,376
I have one?

409
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:11,437
Yeah.

410
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,178
It's a keycard.

411
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:21,378
I really do have a condo.

412
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,613
This place is huge.

413
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,179
Whose is this?

414
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:39,379
You're back, baby?

415
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:42,999
K-Kat?

416
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,006
Why are you here?

417
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,978
Oh, don't act all surprised.

418
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,999
I texted you, didn't I?

419
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,778
I told you I'd be here.

420
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,378
"I'll see you tomorrow night."

421
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,185
"Let's go all out."

422
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,311
"Fuck Buddy"

423
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,616
Come.

424
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,778
What now?

425
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,010
Come on here, babe.

426
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,010
I am so ready to take off.

427
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:34,474
Well, well...

428
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:39,627
Are you playing a shy nerdy doctor tonight?

429
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,658
Yes.

430
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,461
What is there to be shy about now?

431
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:48,978
You and I have seen every nook and cranny.

432
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:51,121
Don't be shy.

433
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,178
Turn around.

434
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,511
I said turn around!

435
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:04,059
- Yes.
- I don't have all the time in the world, you know.

436
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:05,778
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:07,778
Easy there.

438
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,751
Come.

439
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,978
What are you waiting for?

440
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:21,378
Let's do it.

441
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:40,720
K-Kat...

442
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:41,491
Kat.

443
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:42,206
Wait.

444
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:43,841
Kat.

445
00:28:43,844 --> 00:28:45,188
Wait a minute, Kat.

446
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:45,997
It's...

447
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:48,628
It's just...

448
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:50,807
Wait a minute.

449
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:53,030
What's wrong with you?

450
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,978
You're acting strange today.

451
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,185
We agreed we'd be friends with benefit.

452
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,085
What?

453
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,769
Do you want back out of the deal? Should I just leave?

454
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:00,981
Wait, Kat.

455
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,807
It's... It's not like that.

456
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,978
Just give me a minute.

457
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,370
Just a bit.

458
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,578
I need to go to the bathroom.

459
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:12,400
I'll be back.

460
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:24,978
Kat and I are friends with benefits?

461
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:26,836
How the hell did that happen?

462
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:28,581
But it's already happened, Alex.

463
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:33,344
And you gotta learn to grab your chances with both hands.

464
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:37,012
But aren't we basically taking advantage of Kat?

465
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:38,179
Alex, my man.

466
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:40,578
That's the girl of your dream.

467
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:42,978
She's right in front of you.

468
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:47,779
You think someone like you will have a chance like this again?

469
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,407
Alex.

470
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,378
Seize the day.

471
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,778
Alex, you alright?

472
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:54,979
Do you need help with anything?

473
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:56,744
Alex.

474
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:57,782
Come out already.

475
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:58,782
Hurry up.

476
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,840
I am so ready to go actually.

477
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,839
Go for it, Alex.

478
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:04,207
You can do it.

479
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:05,779
Go for it.

480
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:07,047
Alright, Alex.

481
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:08,644
Go for it.

482
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:09,669
Here's your chance.

483
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:11,778
She's your dream girl.

484
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:14,366
Go!

485
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:19,455
Kat.

486
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:20,504
I'm ready.

487
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,778
Kat, wait.

488
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
What now?

489
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,378
Let me get my head in the game.

490
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,778
Oh, shut up, you.

491
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,178
Oh. Kat.

492
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:58,597
What now?

493
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:02,179
It tickles.

494
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,779
It really tickles.

495
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,178
Come here.

496
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,634
Happiness will only come

497
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:19,444
to those whose mind is pure.

498
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,129
When your mind is impure,

499
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,978
your decisions are also impure.

500
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:26,175
Alex, turn that off.

501
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:28,357
Happiness will only come

502
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:29,779
to those whose mind is pure.

503
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:34,579
"Be careful, you player"

504
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,701
Alex, why are you stalling?

505
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:37,828
Just turn it off!

506
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,379
I am turning it off.

507
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,813
That's taken care of.

508
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:45,905
Come.

509
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:50,203
What the hell?

510
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:53,778
Why is it always like this?

511
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:55,061
Alex.

512
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,302
Kat, come here.

513
00:31:57,302 --> 00:31:58,576
Kat.

514
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,576
Kat, where are you?

515
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:02,593
Alex!

516
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:03,324
Kat.

517
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:04,625
Kat, what's that noise?

518
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:06,308
I fell of the bed.

519
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:07,757
You did?

520
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:08,901
Kat, where are you?

521
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,464
Answer me, Kat.

522
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:11,811
I'm here.

523
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:14,485
Enough.

524
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,284
I've been freaking tired, and then this happened.

525
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:17,794
If you're not ready to see me, just be honest.

526
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,088
So I can see someone else.

527
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,050
Wait, Kat.

528
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:22,028
Wait.

529
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:23,215
Don't go.

530
00:32:23,215 --> 00:32:25,607
Kat, we haven't even done it...

531
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:36,978
Do you think Thai women should talk about sex more, Jean?

532
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:38,927
In my opinion,

533
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:44,809
I think sex is something people of all genders should talk about,

534
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,522
but especially among women.

535
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,904
Thai society never lets women talk about this before.

536
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,301
Is that Jean?

537
00:32:55,022 --> 00:33:00,403
Maybe it's our culture and society that already decides

538
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:02,707
that women who talk about this kind of things are bad women,

539
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,603
or that it's an embarrassing topic.

540
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:08,178
Let's hear it from a guy, too.

541
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:11,495
Tony, you're voted The Most Huggable Man of 2022.

542
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:13,604
What do you think about this topic?

543
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,578
I agree.

544
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,979
I think everyone of all genders should be able to discuss sex.

545
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:21,975
No matter male or female,

546
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:26,178
you shouldn't judge anyone for being interested in sex.

547
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,778
I think it's more about appropriateness

548
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:34,578
of places, time, and people.

549
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:37,782
You wouldn't talk about sex at your family gathering, right?

550
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:42,978
Oh, Tony. You're serious and funny, all in one.

551
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:46,264
You're attractive and have a great attitude.

552
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:51,378
I wonder if you're ever interested in working with him, Jean.

553
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:56,816
If there's ever a chance, then it would be my honour.

554
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:58,578
The honour would be mine,

555
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,178
to work with someone so talented.

556
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:29,781
Babe.

557
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:33,378
I bought food.

558
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:34,579
I got you some strawberries, too.

559
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,406
Thank you, Master.

560
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,578
I've been waiting for you all day, you know?

561
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,378
I can't stay the night, though.

562
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,378
I need to keep my mother company.

563
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:50,813
Really?

564
00:34:51,984 --> 00:34:53,536
Stay with me.

565
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:54,572
Can't you stay?

566
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:55,425
Please, please, please?

567
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,624
- Please?
- Babe.

568
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:58,578
I really can't tonight.

569
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:03,939
Stay with me.

570
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:05,218
Just for a bit.

571
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,224
Please?

572
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:08,228
We hardly see each other lately.

573
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,178
Please?

574
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:14,178
We can... do something fun together.

575
00:35:16,939 --> 00:35:17,939
And what's that?

576
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:22,006
Just the usual.

577
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:25,317
Again?

578
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:26,708
Do you like that so much?

579
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:28,576
You know I do.

580
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:30,978
You do, too, don't you?

581
00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:36,978
I have a surprise for you.

582
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:38,179
Check it out.

583
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:44,178
Babe.

584
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,578
I'll wait in my room.

585
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,976
You put that on and

586
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:53,778
please, bring me the food you bought.

587
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,181
See you inside.

588
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,441
Laika.

589
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:19,441
Laika, come here.

590
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:23,213
Hello, good boy.

591
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:25,812
Sit down, Laika.

592
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:26,626
Sit, Laika.

593
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:27,671
Sit.

594
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:28,444
Good job.

595
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:29,444
Give me your hand.

596
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:31,607
Hand... wait, Laika.

597
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,741
Good job.

598
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,778
Good boy. Good boy.

599
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:36,981
Here.

600
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:41,133
Here, here.

601
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,978
A treat for a good boy.

602
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:47,381
Do you like that?

603
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:50,178
Eat a lot, Laika.

604
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,382
Eat slowly, Laika.

605
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:00,979
Laika, no.

606
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,378
Laika.

607
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:04,585
Be nice.

608
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,907
Who hit you, baby? Who hurt you?

609
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,381
Now, now. I'll get 'em for you, Laika.

610
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,767
Good boy, Laika.

611
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:26,899
Laika.

612
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,647
Army.

613
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:06,981
How did you get in here?

614
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,379
What's with you?

615
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,557
You're the one who gave me the key.

616
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:14,644
You said in case I need to drag you to work after a long night partying.

617
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:16,564
If you're so worried that you will be late to work,

618
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:21,843
I can just sleep with you to keep you in time.

619
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:23,023
No.

620
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:23,732
Get up.

621
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:24,950
- I'm lonely.
- Get up.

622
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:26,207
Army, get up.

623
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:26,870
What's wrong with you?

624
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:28,579
Get up, up, up, up.

625
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:32,176
Just go take a shower.

626
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:35,101
What for?

627
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:36,978
We have to go to work.

628
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,179
What?

629
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,778
Want me to get in the shower with you?

630
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,975
No. I can do it myself.

631
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:45,804
Are you sure?

632
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:46,804
Yeah.

633
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:47,818
Listen.

634
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:50,179
I'm feeling kinda unwell.

635
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,458
I think I need a break.

636
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:53,307
You go to work.

637
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:54,508
Really?

638
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,778
Is it since you passed out that day?

639
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:02,178
I'm really starting to worry about you.

640
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:05,448
Do I need to move in just in case?

641
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:06,507
I can take better care of you that way.

642
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:07,612
No, you don't.

643
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,861
- Should I?
- Don't.

644
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,216
Army, don't.

645
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,779
I can take care of myself.

646
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:13,364
- Just go.
- I'm worried about you.

647
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,379
I can take care of myself. Just go to work.

648
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,778
Alright. I'm going.

649
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,178
Call me if you need anything.

650
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,578
Alright, darling?

651
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:25,490
Go away!

652
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,578
I'm off to work. Call me.

653
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:38,807
Since when did I ever get so chummy with Army?

654
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:42,884
And now Kat and I are friends with benefits?

655
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:45,379
You're doing it with Kat?

656
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,978
I wish.

657
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,516
I never get around to the doing.

658
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:51,473
What do you mean?

659
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,938
It's my mother's curse.

660
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,461
I can never climax again.

661
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:58,578
Every time I'm about to have sex, something terrible happens.

662
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:00,978
Hey.

663
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,378
Maybe you need to fix it from the very beginning.

664
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:08,178
Because you broke that promise at the party that night.

665
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:12,979
Could be.

666
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:16,578
But who was my first time?

667
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,658
And how would I know that?

668
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:20,803
I wasn't in your pants, you know.

669
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,778
But honestly, from what I remember...

670
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:26,178
First, you kissed Kat.

671
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,065
You look real handsome when you're drunk, you know?

672
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:33,378
Then, you kissed Molly.

673
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:35,043
Alex, you bastard!

674
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:36,978
Why did you kiss my girlfriend?

675
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,378
Then, you bagged Jean.

676
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:42,982
And then...

677
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,378
And then what?

678
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:46,578
You kissed Army.

679
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:51,065
Holy...

680
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,280
I kissed Army?

681
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,524
And then you kissed me.

682
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:54,421
Bastard. Really?

683
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:55,530
Kidding.

684
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,105
I just enjoy the look of sheer shock on your face.

685
00:40:58,105 --> 00:40:59,779
Asshole.

686
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:03,378
From all the names I've said,

687
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,778
which one do you think could be your first?

688
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:11,778
I think it's...

689
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,604
- Jean.
- Jean.

690
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,378
I think so.

691
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,403
You came to me asking for a condom so you could sleep with Jean.

692
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:21,376
But I didn't actually see you use it with her, though.

693
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,241
Why can't I think of anything?

694
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,596
Why can't I seem to remember anything?

695
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:34,006
You'll never come up with anything all by yourself.

696
00:41:34,132 --> 00:41:35,778
Go ask her.

697
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:40,581
I do remember one thing.

698
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:43,702
I took a photo of Jean, too.

699
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:44,730
But where is that photo?

700
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:45,974
See?

701
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,404
This is all the more reason to go to her.

702
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:51,379
I think the key to this whole mess

703
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:52,582
is Jean.

704
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,778
How do I find her?

705
00:42:04,364 --> 00:42:05,778
Don't worry about that.

706
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,178
When it comes to stalking friends online,

707
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,104
I'm the expert.

708
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,699
Cut.

709
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:36,643
Ploy, you gotta add more queen bee energy into this.

710
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:38,461
You're surrounded by hot men.

711
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:41,397
You gotta make them feel like they can't take their hands off you.

712
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:44,503
If you're not confident enough, it's going to show really clearly in your gaze.

713
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,685
So be more confident.

714
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:48,834
What do you mean, Jean?

715
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:51,378
I'm very new to all this.

716
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:53,982
I'll show you.

717
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:54,767
Alright?

718
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:55,892
Excuse me.

719
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:58,007
Hit the music.

720
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,610
Something like this.

721
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,936
Try it.

722
00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:29,320
Maybe you gotta do it yourself, Director?

723
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,573
You're clearly good at it.

724
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:32,684
It's my job to be good at everything.

725
00:43:32,684 --> 00:43:35,446
Oil their muscles up a little.

726
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,255
Alright.

727
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:37,255
Okay, then.

728
00:43:37,557 --> 00:43:38,600
Let's try again.

729
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,379
Yes.

730
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:40,695
She sure orders us around, huh?

731
00:43:40,695 --> 00:43:42,508
We're not a drive-thru, dammit.

732
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,833
You even taught her how to dance?

733
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:47,821
You really do everything around here.

734
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:49,776
That's what happens when you don't give me enough budget.

735
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:52,578
Give me more money next time so I don't have to be so tired.

736
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:53,677
Of course.

737
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:55,715
We'll make sure to give you big bucks for your next project.

738
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:57,379
Are you interested in filmmaking?

739
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,305
Yes.

740
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:02,926
I know some producer who wants to make a film about women.

741
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:05,443
I think you're perfect for the job.

742
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:08,178
Tony Theeradej will be joining us, too.

743
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:09,882
If you're interested, I'll email you the details.

744
00:44:09,907 --> 00:44:10,942
I very much am.

745
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:11,779
Thank you so much.

746
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:12,978
I'll be in your care.

747
00:44:13,905 --> 00:44:15,378
For now, let me get back to work.

748
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,084
I'll send it over to you soon.

749
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:18,096
Thank you.

750
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:20,178
Alright, everyone. Get ready.

751
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:23,308
Good job. See you on the next project.

752
00:44:23,308 --> 00:44:24,978
Thank you.

753
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,978
That's a wrap, y'all.

754
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,778
Thank you.

755
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:40,108
Jean.

756
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:52,576
Why are you here?

757
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:53,776
Who let you in?

758
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:57,601
I saw you on TV the other day.

759
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,307
You're a director now?

760
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:04,578
Yeah.

761
00:45:05,062 --> 00:45:06,978
And what does that have to do with you?

762
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:08,825
Well...

763
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,466
Good job, Jean.

764
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,508
You did it just as you told me you would.

765
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:13,704
Amazing.

766
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:20,178
When did I ever tell you that?

767
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,379
I don't remember anything like that.

768
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:22,604
Not that I ever want to.

769
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:25,588
Just say what you're here to say or I'm going home.

770
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:27,376
Jean, wait.

771
00:45:28,046 --> 00:45:30,028
Can we talk somewhere else?

772
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:33,378
It's... kinda private.

773
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:35,280
No.

774
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,978
We talk here.

775
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:39,609
Whatever you need to say, you only have 10 seconds.

776
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:40,321
10 seconds?

777
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,321
10.

778
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:44,178
Nine.

779
00:45:45,347 --> 00:45:46,279
Eight.

780
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:46,991
Seven.

781
00:45:47,016 --> 00:45:49,251
Well, that-that night....

782
00:45:49,276 --> 00:45:51,226
At Jedi's party.

783
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,578
Do you remember that?

784
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,378
Five.

785
00:45:58,196 --> 00:45:59,681
Four.

786
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:00,617
Three.

787
00:46:00,642 --> 00:46:01,493
Two.

788
00:46:01,518 --> 00:46:03,417
Did we have sex that night?

789
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,819
Jean.

790
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:18,407
Why'd you that?

791
00:46:18,627 --> 00:46:20,803
I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

792
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:24,507
Hey, what's the answer?

793
00:46:24,507 --> 00:46:26,179
Did we do it that night?

794
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,849
Directed by Tichakorn Phukhaotong and Pinya Chookamsri

795
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:04,578
This is the relationship chart I've come up with.

796
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:05,710
Alex.

797
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:06,692
Army, don't hurt me.

798
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:07,659
What did you see just now?

799
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,120
Other boyfriends take their girl shopping and whatnot.

800
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,978
But you're making me look at dog masks and leather suits?

801
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:15,160
I don't think we should be in this kind of relationship.

802
00:47:15,222 --> 00:47:17,441
Ugh, men. Why didn't you just tell me honestly?

803
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:19,073
How could two women get married?

804
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:20,333
Look where we are.

805
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:23,206
We could be born again ten times and that still wouldn't be possible.

806
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:24,978
Hello.
