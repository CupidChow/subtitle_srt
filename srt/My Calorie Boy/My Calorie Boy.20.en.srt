(I have a secret to tell you.)

16
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,980
Tangtang,

17
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,570
tell Zhou Tian

18
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,740
to rewrite the first three chapters

19
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,620
and put more thought into them.

20
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,570
Yes, Editor-in-Chief.

21
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,370
Qi,

22
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,210
remind the other authors

23
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,060
to submit their manuscripts.

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,010
Got it.

25
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,410
Hello? Who is this?

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,650
Hello? Madam Shi?

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,370
Gao Zhan and Dapeng
got into a fight again!

28
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,570
Where are they?

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,650
Is she coming?

30
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,540
Kids.

31
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,180
I'm already starting
to feel nervous now.

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,370
What should I do?

33
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,180
My dear interior designer.

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,180
I've decorated

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,770
the house based on

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,970
your advice.

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
What do you think?

38
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,770
It's not bad I guess.

39
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,970
I put in so much effort

40
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,340
and I only get a "not bad"?

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,930
What else is not that good?

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,650
We can...

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,090
Dad. No.

44
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,090
I can't get used

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,690
to seeing you

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,860
in this outfit.

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,490
You'll get used to it.

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,370
You don't understand.

49
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,860
Madam Xiaohui

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,740
will love this outfit.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
I look very reliable in this.

52
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,770
It looks like a stolen outfit.

53
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,620
Do you understand?

54
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,970
Stolen?

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,340
Don't I look dashing in this?

56
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,770
Don't I look dashing in this?

57
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,580
You do.

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,460
That's right. I think so too.

59
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,250
You look like an estate agent.

60
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,210
Am I right?

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
What do you think?

62
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,740
You brat.

63
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,650
If I'm an estate agent,

64
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,530
I'll sell you off first.

65
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,020
Come. Let's go to the garden.

66
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,370
Help me arrange the flowers.

67
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,370
An estate agent?

68
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,900
Jingjing told me
that you fought with Dapeng.

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,140
Mum, calm down.

70
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,250
Madam Shi.

71
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,250
Madam Shi.

72
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,770
What's happening?

73
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,650
We didn't fight.

74
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,900
You didn't fight?

75
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,250
Come in first.

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,930
Xiaohui.

77
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,460
I haven't seen you in a few days.

78
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,020
I miss you so much.

79
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,930
It hasn't been that many days.

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,140
I...

81
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,860
Actually, I know it already.

82
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,930
Gao Zhan has told me

83
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,210
about your reservations about us.

84
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,620
I understand now.

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,860
You are afraid that if we get together,

86
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,180
our lives will change.

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,250
When you have

88
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,970
too many people in your life,

89
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,180
it will affect

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,690
the children's studies in Grade 12.

91
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,130
But today,

92
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,620
I brought you here to dispel

93
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,620
that concern of yours.

94
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,810
Xiaohui, look.

95
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,980
What do you think
about this living room?

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,180
Are you here to buy a house with me?

97
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,330
No.

98
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,130
I...

99
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,250
He forgot his lines.

100
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,490
You...

101
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,220
Have you heard

102
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,860
about that theory?

103
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,570
What theory?

104
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,420
What theory?

105
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,450
The Cathedral Theory!

106
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,570
Yes.

107
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,450
The Cathedral Theory.

108
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,420
Look at how high this ceiling is.

109
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,690
Based on the Cathedral Theory,

110
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,220
If you

111
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,300
often stay under

112
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,490
a room with a high ceiling,

113
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,980
you'll become stimulated.

114
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,250
Stimulated?

115
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,930
Yes. You'll become stimulated.

116
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,740
When you are stimulated,

117
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,980
it'll promise your divergent thinking

118
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,130
and creativity.

119
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,570
In other words,
it'll help with one's studies.

120
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,420
Do you know that?

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,100
Yes. That's the theory.

122
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,220
That's the theory.

123
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,300
Who did you learn it from?

124
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,450
Xu Jingjing.

125
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,690
She told Pengpeng about it.

126
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,130
And Pengpeng told me.

127
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,220
So, I researched it.

128
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,300
And I found the scientist
behind this theory.

129
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,370
So, I learned it from the scientist.

130
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,890
It's a theory from a scientist.

131
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,220
Xiaohui.

132
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,010
How about

133
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,860
I show you the next place?

134
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,810
Ni.

135
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,130
Why are you dressing

136
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,420
like an estate agent today?

137
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,130
Do I look like one?

138
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,250
Yes.

139
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,370
This is bad.

140
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,690
Pengpeng said the same thing.

141
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,620
Be careful.

142
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,060
Ni.

143
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,420
What is this...

144
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,420
Hui.

145
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,980
I'm sincere towards you.

146
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,420
And I really like

147
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,740
Gao Zhan as a person.

148
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,250
I just want to take good care

149
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,100
of you and him.

150
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm telling the truth.

151
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,890
I know.

152
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,220
If we

153
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,130
live together,

154
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,130
it'll take time

155
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,570
for us to get used to each other.

156
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,010
You are worried that this issue

157
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,420
will affect the children.

158
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,300
But it's okay. Don't worry.

159
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,620
Look.

160
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,780
This room

161
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,250
with a balcony

162
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,810
is reserved especially for Gao Zhan.

163
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,220
It's spacious.

164
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,540
The air circulation is good.

165
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
It won't affect

166
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,780
his studies.

167
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,740
Don't worry.

168
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,370
Besides,

169
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,060
if you need anything after this,

170
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,330
you can just tell me about it.

171
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,490
I'll give you everything I can.

172
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,810
Okay?

173
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,890
Ni.

174
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,100
Thank you

175
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,010
for doing so much for us.

176
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,330
You don't have to thank me.

177
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,620
Just don't say "but", okay?

178
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,450
Mum.

179
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,420
I promise you

180
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,570
that nothing

181
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,890
will affect my studies.

182
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,330
Besides,

183
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,010
I really like the design

184
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,980
of the room just now.

185
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,780
See?

186
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,330
That's right, Madam Shi.

187
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,330
I like Gao Zhan too.

188
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,060
Do you like me, Gao Zhan?

189
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,930
I

190
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,250
like you.

191
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,220
Hui.

192
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,490
Xiaohui.

193
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,890
Say yes.

194
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,330
Will you marry me?

195
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,780
No. Don't cry.

196
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,370
Tell me.

197
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,860
Will you say yes?

198
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,930
What do you think?

199
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,660
This is bad.

200
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,620
Is she rejecting him?

201
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,540
Yes.

202
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,930
Both of you

203
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,890
are really alike.

204
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,810
No.

205
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,740
Hui.

206
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,490
Can you give me an answer?

207
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,220
If you do this to me,

208
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,490
I won't be able to sleep

209
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
and eat every day.

210
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,100
Look at me.

211
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,860
I'm already like this.

212
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,130
Just say yes, okay?

213
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,810
Hui.

214
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,380
Yes.

215
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,090
Is it really a yes?

216
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,930
Congratulations, dad!

217
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,850
Wait.

218
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,970
Wait, you brat.

219
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,610
Congratulations, dad!

220
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,780
My dad is going to get married!

221
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,300
My dad is going to get married!

222
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,300
Congratulations, dad!

223
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,690
You've done a lot for us today.

224
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:55,810
Thank you.

225
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,730
No problem.

226
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
We are all friends.

227
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,730
You should go back first.

228
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,210
Mr. Ni and Madam Shi
are still waiting for you

229
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,930
to discuss the wedding together.

230
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,210
Let me escort you to the bus station.

231
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,260
You've put a lot of effort

232
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,730
into today's marriage proposal.
Thank you.

233
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,420
You've already thanked me

234
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,570
five times today.

235
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,140
Is that so?

236
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,380
This is for you.

237
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,900
What is this?

238
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,380
It's an alarm device.

239
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,420
If you are in danger,

240
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,380
just press it.

241
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,420
I don't think I need this.

242
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,540
Don't you know how strong I am?

243
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,330
I don't need this.

244
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,380
You are going back

245
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,330
by yourself tonight.

246
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,810
I'm worried about your safety.

247
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,300
Thank you.

248
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,380
You are welcome.

249
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,330
Let's go.

250
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,610
Why weren't you here in the morning?

251
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,420
Tell me.

252
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,300
Where did you go to have fun?

253
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,090
I have a piece of major news for you.

254
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,540
Dapeng's dad has succeeded
with his marriage proposal.

255
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,180
And he's

256
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,260
going to become Gao Zhan's brother.

257
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,330
Really?

258
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:47,970
Yes.

259
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,140
I witnessed it myself.

260
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,450
No wonder you were absent this morning.

261
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,730
What is it

262
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,020
around your neck?

263
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,810
It's an alarm device.

264
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,260
This is such a guy thing.

265
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,780
It's from Gao Zhan, right?

266
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,690
Take it off and show me.

267
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,780
There's nothing to see.

268
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,730
Don't take it off.

269
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,500
Are you from this class?

270
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,180
Go back to your own class.

271
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,020
Don't disturb others.

272
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,970
Okay.

273
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,330
I just want one thing.

274
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,330
I just want a simple wedding.

275
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,380
Yes.

276
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
We are on the same page.

277
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,060
We'll just do a low-profile wedding.

278
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,180
It'll just be a simple one.

279
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,570
Dad.

280
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,090
That was not what you said.

281
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,810
I can't believe you.

282
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,540
If she wants it simple,

283
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,260
(Xu Jingjing)
we'll just do it her way, okay?

284
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,690
Okay.

285
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,970
Ni, actually, I think

286
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,180
that the garden just now is perfect.

287
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,850
And it feels cosy to do it at home too.

288
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,060
Look at how good her idea is.

289
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,810
Right?

290
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,570
It'll be super cosy.

291
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,090
Yes.

292
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,610
Yes. We'll just do it your way.

293
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,180
How about

294
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,500
we go to the garden now?

295
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,660
You can plan it out right away.

296
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,780
Let's see how we can change it.

297
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,300
Okay?

298
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,140
What do you think?

299
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,450
I think that's a good idea.

300
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,810
Okay. Let's go.

301
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,900
Come.

302
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,900
Look.

303
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,780
I think

304
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,300
we need to have more plants.

305
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,330
Brother.

306
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,210
What do you think about the wedding?

307
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,610
Do you have to call me brother?

308
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,540
Then...

309
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,540
Big brother?

310
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,780
Or just brother?

311
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,610
Pick one.

312
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,540
Just call me brother then.

313
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,850
Okay.

314
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,850
Brother.

315
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,690
Wang Jiayao sent me a message on WeChat.

316
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,810
She had never sent me

317
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,540
a message before.

318
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,330
Look.

319
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,610
She wishes my dad luck
in his marriage proposal.

320
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,690
Let me ask you.

321
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,610
If a girl

322
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,780
often sends you messages in the past

323
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,690
but stops after that

324
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,660
and doesn't even reply to you

325
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,020
when you message her,

326
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,730
what do you think the problem is?

327
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,210
Are you talking about Xu Jingjing?

328
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,180
Is this

329
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,500
the legendary playing soft to get?

330
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,610
Do you mean playing hard to get?

331
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,780
Yes. Playing hard to get.

332
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,020
That's the one.

333
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,260
Wait. She hasn't given you an answer

334
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,300
about attending a university

335
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,780
in Beijing?

336
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,850
What should I do now?

337
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,330
I'm telling you the truth.

338
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,450
Your design for that place

339
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,060
is going to take it to the next level.

340
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,420
But there's only one problem left now.

341
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,610
What about the bridesmaid
and the best man?

342
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
At this age,

343
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,780
we don't really have any friends

344
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,730
who are still unmarried.

345
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,020
Who says we need
the bridesmaid and the best man?

346
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,810
We don't need them.

347
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
How can we hold a wedding without...

348
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,180
Here!

349
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,540
Here. You already have two here.

350
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,330
Nonsense. You are too young

351
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,500
to be the best man and the bridesmaid.

352
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,500
Even if we can't become
the best man and the bridesmaid,

353
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,500
we can become the page boys.

354
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,180
You don't necessarily need

355
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,420
a best man and a bridesmaid
in a wedding.

356
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,060
Am I right, brother?

357
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,420
Aren't you shy to call yourself
a page boy?

358
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,140
I don't care.

359
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,260
I want to become the page boy.

360
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,730
We can find more people to join us.

361
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,090
Then, it'll be a lively wedding.

362
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,850
Right?

363
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,090
Okay, son.

364
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,330
I'll say yes to that.

365
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,780
Page boys and flower girls?

366
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,060
Who else will join us?

367
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,500
We are so old already.

368
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,420
We can't be the page boys
and flower girls.

369
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,540
We can be the best man
and the bridesmaid then.

370
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,730
I don't want to be your bridesmaid.

371
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,420
Do you know

372
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,140
that you can only

373
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,380
be a bridesmaid three times at most?

374
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,420
After three times,

375
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,690
you won't be able to get married.

376
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,540
It's okay.

377
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,180
Jiayao.

378
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,420
If you can't get married,
I'll take care of you.

379
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,970
Well...

380
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,090
I don't need you to take care of me.

381
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,540
There's no way that I can't get married.

382
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,690
Actually,

383
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,690
I don't want to trouble you
with this too.

384
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,450
But Dapeng and I

385
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,420
really want to

386
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,300
take part in this wedding.

387
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,930
But with our age right now,

388
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,660
we can't be the best man

389
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,850
or the bridesmaid.

390
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,500
That's why we came up with this.

391
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,610
Okay.

392
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,730
I'll do it.

393
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,500
What about you?

394
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,380
Jingjing.

395
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,500
Are you mad?

396
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,610
I also think that this wedding

397
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,660
is quite meaningful

398
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,420
for Gao Zhan and Dapeng.

399
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,730
We should help them.

400
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,020
Since you've already said that,

401
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,850
what else can I say?

402
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,260
It'll be my first time
as the flower girl.

403
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,210
I think it'll be quite fun.

404
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,540
Great!

405
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,450
Jiayao.

406
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,450
You'll look beautiful in a dress.

407
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,610
Does this mean that I'll walk

408
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,970
on the red carpet with Jiayao together?

By the way,

418
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,900
we are just the page boys
and flower girls.

419
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,610
I don't think we need

420
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,380
to wear something so formal.

421
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,210
No.

422
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,540
We still need to have the formality.

423
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,260
That's right.

424
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,450
Come. Let's take a photo together.

The process of combustion

428
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,690
is periodic.

429
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,690
This is the consequence

430
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,780
of adding fuel
to the fire intermittently.

431
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,690
The longer it takes to add the fuel,

432
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,020
the more serious the effect

433
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,730
of the periodic combustion.

434
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,330
Who can tell me

435
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,090
(It's quite the experience to be a flower girl at this age.)
the characteristics

436
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,690
(It's quite the experience to be a flower girl at this age.)
of the new fuel?

437
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,610
Page boys and flower girls?

438
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,610
What are you talking about?

439
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,420
Are you okay?

440
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,450
Teacher, I...

441
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,540
I'm having a stomach ache.

442
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,930
Okay. Let's go back

443
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,210
to our previous question.

444
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,460
Hello?

445
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,500
Why are you the flower girl?

446
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,980
Dapeng's dad

447
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,020
proposed to Gao Zhan's mum.

448
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,740
And she said yes.

449
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,890
They are going to get married.

450
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,940
It's their wedding.

451
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,540
What has it got to do with you?

452
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,610
Wait. Kang Jiawei.

453
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,740
Why are you so mad?

454
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,500
I...

455
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,780
I'm not mad. Why should I?

456
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,700
Why should I be mad?

457
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm not the flower girl.

458
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,700
I'm not the only flower girl anyway.

459
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,090
Besides, I think it's

460
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,650
quite meaningful to be able

461
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,650
to witness their wedding.

462
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,700
What about your drawings?

463
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,850
What about your drawings?

464
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,540
What do you mean?

465
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,890
You are so busy with the wedding

466
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
and now, you are the flower girl.

467
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,260
It's such a waste of time.

468
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:48,980
Have you forgotten

469
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,780
that the college entrance examination
for art students will be here soon?

470
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,130
The wedding is on Saturday.
It's just one day.

471
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,170
It won't affect me.

472
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:53,850
Besides, my initial plan

473
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,570
was to work on that day too.

474
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,610
I think that you are defeating

475
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,300
the purpose

476
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,570
of a closed training right now.

477
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,460
You work every day after school.

478
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,300
And after working,

479
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,370
you go out with Gao Zhan.

480
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,570
Now, you are the flower girl.

481
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,410
Don't you think that these things

482
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,810
are wasting your time?

483
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,810
You are the one

484
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,410
who's wasting my time.

485
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,020
It's just a waste of time

486
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,610
for you to call me.

487
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,060
Hello?

488
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,540
Hello?

489
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,130
She hung up?

490
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,890
Xu Jingjing, how dare you hang up on me.

491
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,300
Why aren't you eating?

492
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,540
The wedding is on this Saturday.

493
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,130
So?

494
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,650
They must be worried

495
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,700
that the dress won't fit on that day.

496
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,330
Do you think you are that smart?

497
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,850
Jiayao.

498
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,300
Actually, you are already very slim.

499
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,610
You don't have to go on a diet.

500
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,040
(Duty of a bridesmaid
and a flower girl.)

501
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,330
Look at the words in red.

502
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,460
Is this the thing that we have to do?

503
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,500
Yes.

504
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,850
My mum is worried that you'll miss it.

505
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,980
So, she highlighted it.

506
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,810
Actually, it's not bad.

507
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,170
It's not as hard as I expected.

508
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,700
It's quite easy.

509
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,090
But from the other weddings

510
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,260
that my dad officiated,

511
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,780
those weddings are like
cultural performance events.

512
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,500
So many different shows.

513
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,260
Yes.

514
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,540
That's what my dad likes.

515
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,220
How about

516
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,810
we do a performance too?

517
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,850
What kind of performance?

518
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,060
What about singing?

519
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,090
Brother.

520
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,220
If you say yes, I'll back you up.

521
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,060
Xu Jingjing.

522
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,500
Why did you mention that?

523
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,780
I'm regretting it now.

524
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,130
Jingjing.

525
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,980
Let's sing together.

526
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,090
What is it?

527
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,740
Miss Chen.

528
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,980
I can't take it anymore!

529
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,500
What are you doing?

530
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,570
Sit down.

531
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,460
Miss Chen.

532
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,020
This is

533
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,740
not the date that I want.

534
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,610
You wanted to come

535
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,940
to this internet celebrity cafe, right?

536
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,890
So, I'm here with you.

537
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,540
But does this

538
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,130
look like a date to you?

539
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,370
Others will think

540
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,850
that I'm a voyeur.

541
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,740
Keep it down.

542
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,060
Miss Chen.

543
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,890
Tell me the truth.

544
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,410
Do you

545
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,780
feel embarrassed to be with me?

546
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,940
Zhao Donglin.

547
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,570
Why will you think so?

548
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,610
Why are we acting like

549
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,090
the cowherd and the weaver girl then?

550
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,810
As I said,

551
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,060
I don't want our students
to see us together.

552
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,220
The city is so big.

553
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,850
We won't

554
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,130
run into them so easily.

555
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,330
Moreover,

556
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,300
even if they see us together,

557
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
we can tell them

558
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,090
that we are preparing
the lessons together.

559
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,570
A language teacher and a sports teacher

560
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,540
preparing lessons together?

561
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,090
Will you believe it?

562
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,890
Principal Shen has asked me
to take over the advanced class

563
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,850
when the school reopens.

564
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,020
I'm new to teaching Grade 12.

565
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,460
And I'm already given
such an important task.

566
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,890
I don't want to fail anyone.

567
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,300
If my students find out about us,

568
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,850
I'll lose my authority

569
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,020
in front of them.

570
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,610
Sir, this is your lemon Sprite.

571
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,090
I didn't order it.

572
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,810
I ordered it for you.

573
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,410
Are you trying to bribe me?

574
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,410
I'm sorry for today.

575
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,940
So, drink this and tamp down your anger.

576
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,220
I won't drop this

577
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,060
so easily.

578
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,220
We need to have a real date

579
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,260
during this summer holiday.

580
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,330
Okay.

581
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,890
Roger that.

582
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,410
One!

583
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,260
Two!

584
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,940
Okay. Relax.

585
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,500
We'll take a five-minute break.

586
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,570
You are dismissed.

587
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,330

Why do I feel like

618
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,810
I can't sing these two lines well?

619
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,650
That's not true.
I think you sang them quite well.

620
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,890
That's because you sang
even worse than me.

621
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,300
It's fine.

622
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,300
Even if we can't sing well,

623
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,330
we still have Dapeng and Jiayao.

Even if they can't sing well,
we have your dad.

My dad?

626
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,170
Did I say your dad?

627
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,060
You did.

628
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,940
Wait.

629
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,410
Don't tell me that Mr. Gao and Madam Shi

630
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,020
have appointed my dad
to be the master of ceremonies?

631
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,090
Let me tell you.

632
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,410
If my dad is there tomorrow,

633
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,500
I won't go.

634
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,650
I think you should

635
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,410
talk to your dad.

636
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,500
Why should I talk to him first?

637
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,260
It was not my fault.

638
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,650
Okay.

639
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,220
May everything go smoothly

It's okay.

642
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:40,810
Okay.

643
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,130
That's it for now.

644
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,330
You scared me.

645
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,570
You scared me.

646
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,300
What are you doing?

647
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,020
Why are you so jumpy?

648
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,940
I'm jumpy?

649
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,740
What's wrong?

650
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,020
Because of your beloved daughter,

651
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,370
I've been fired.

652
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,980
Jingjing is so capable now.

653
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,020
Amazing.

654
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,700
How could you laugh at this?

655
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,500
Let me tell you. She

656
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,810
has tarnished my career.

657
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,060
How could you laugh at this?

658
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,370
Is this how it's going to be

659
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,850
between the two of you?

660
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,020
Do you think I want this?

661
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,700
Gao Zhan hired me as the emcee

662
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,610
because he wanted me

663
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,500
to use this chance

664
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,260
to mend my relationship with her.

665
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,060
But look at what happened.

666
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,890
If you had apologised to her,

667
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,330
this would not have happened.

668
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,610
Why should I apologise to her first?

670
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,170
You are just being stubborn now.

671
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,570
You lost your daughter

672
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,700
and your extra income.

673
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,650
I...

674
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,060
I admit that I lost the extra income.

675
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,700
But I'm not being stubborn.

676
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,130
How is it?

677
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,020
I've taken care of it.

678
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,700
Did he say something?

679
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,890
Nothing.

680
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,090
He just wished us luck for tomorrow.

681
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,940

00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,170
to practise like this.

750

You should continue with your practice.

756

Why are you here?

762
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,460
I'm here to sing.

763
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,940

764
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:06,980
No.

837

is telling us

that parents play a huge role
in the galaxy too.

No.

849

the music that you've listened to

858
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,460
and the things
that you complained about.

859
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,380
I...

860
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,900
I don't understand why she wants

861
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,210
to copy the contents of my Weibo.

862
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,940
I don't understand too.

863
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:56,980
But that's not important.

864
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,130
The important thing is,

865
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,090
you are

866
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,090
the real internet friend of mine.

867
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,250
Your posts online

868
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,610
are the ones that attracted me.

869
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,730
Actually, the one

870
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,690
who I've been looking for is you.

871
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,340
It has always been you.

872
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,090
Do you understand?

873
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,170
If you don't believe me,

874
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,420
you can see it for yourself.

875
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:45,770
No. I...

876
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,500
I'm confused now.

877
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,500
I still have something to do.

878
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,500
Okay.

879
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,090
I understand.

880
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,060
It's okay. You can do your things first.

881
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,250
I'll leave now.

883
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,860
Are you here

884
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,900
just to tell me about this?

885
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,170
Yes.

886
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,460
I'm here just to tell you about it.

887
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,290
And then?

888
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,860
Xu Jingjing.

889
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,210
It's time to take a photo together.

890
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,690
And then,

891
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,060
I don't know.

892
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,690
Come, Jiayao. Here you go.

893
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,380
These are too many.

894
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,170
Take more.

895
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,170
It's okay. Take them all.

896
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,570
I can get more for you
if they are not enough.

897
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,650
Do you like toffee

898
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,610
or chocolates?

899
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:06,460
Forget it.

900
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,210
I'll get them all for you.

901
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,770
It's okay. These are more than enough.

902
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,690
Thank you for today.

903
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:13,940
You are welcome.

904
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,500
Let me send the two of you home later.

905
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,500
You don't have to do that.

906
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,730
We've already booked a car ride.

907
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,290
Tell Dapeng

908
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,170
that we are leaving now.

909
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,290
Thank you for these.

00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,500
Okay.

how to bring it up to you.
