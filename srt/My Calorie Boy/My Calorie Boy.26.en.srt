(Under the same roof)

16
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:49,174
Mr. Kang?

17
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:52,933
Mr. Kang.

18
00:01:56,974 --> 00:01:57,814
What a surprise, Jingjing.

19
00:01:58,094 --> 00:01:59,014
It's really you.

20
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:00,734
Why are you here?

21
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:01,693
Are you...

22
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,333
Are you sick?

23
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,173
What's wrong?

24
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:15,814
I have liver cancer.

25
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:27,573
So

26
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,214
you lied to Kang Jiawei

27
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,094
that you went on a business trip.

28
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:35,453
Don't let Wei know about this.

29
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:37,413
But...

30
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:38,573
He...

31
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,453
He'll worry sick.

32
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,893
I don't want to affect his exam.

33
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,133
You can't keep it from him.

34
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:50,534
When his mom

35
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:51,334
and I divorced,

36
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,974
it gave him a huge blow.

37
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:54,733
At that time,

38
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:56,293
he couldn't sleep at night.

39
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,573
He'd binge-eat during the day.

40
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,214
Day after day,

41
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:02,573
I saw how he became overweight.

42
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:03,974
He was always distracted

43
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,013
no matter what he did.

44
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:07,254
I don't want him to experience
such a blow again.

45
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:09,974
Especially since he's in Grade 12 now.

46
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:12,494
Then...

47
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:18,094
Can you manage this alone?

48
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,133
I hired someone

49
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,054
to help me.

50
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:22,453
Also,

51
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:23,534
I'll call his mom

52
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:24,853
in a few days.

53
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,413
She'll come and take care of me.

54
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,054
Stop worrying already.

55
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,133
I'm planning

56
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:32,214
to tell Wei

57
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:33,774
after the surgery.

58
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,613
He'll feel relieved this way.

59
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:38,893
But you must help me keep

60
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:39,853
this a secret.

61
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:46,413
Where is she?

62
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:58,934
No, it's this side.

63
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:00,254
Madam, I...

64
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:01,413
Xu Jingjing!

65
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:05,534
You're out of your mind.

66
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,133
You're all out of your mind!

67
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:08,494
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,293
Does apology help?

69
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:11,534
It's the most important test

70
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:12,893
in my daughter's life.

71
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:14,334
Do you know how much effort

72
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:15,774
she put in since she was a kid?

73
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,493
She missed it because of you!

74
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:19,293
Do you think
you can take responsibility?

75
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,413
Can you?

76
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,053
Mom!

77
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:49,293
Mom!

78
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:51,293
Mom!

79
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:53,214
Explain yourself!

80
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,053
Why didn't you take the test?

81
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,094
Why?

82
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,053
Why didn't you tell me

83
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,534
I had a second test with Shidai?

84
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,574
That type of company is a fraud.

85
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,774
They'll ruin your life!

86
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,094
Who do you think

87
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:06,334
is trying to ruin me?

88
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,253
Are you saying I'm ruining your life?

89
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,053
Jingjing.

90
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:14,613
You were so obedient to me

91
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,053
when you were young.

92
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:17,813
How did you turn

93
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:18,894
into like this?

94
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,253
- What happened?
- Mom!

95
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,413
I never changed.

96
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:24,173
But you never

97
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:25,334
try to understand me.

98
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:27,694
If you understand me,

99
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,574
you'll know

100
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:30,774
I longer like ballet anymore.

101
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:32,774
If you understand me,

102
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,094
you'll know

103
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,214
when I failed

104
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:36,853
to enter the dance academy
three years ago,

105
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:37,613
I wasn't feeling unhappy

106
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,173
at that time

107
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,933
but a feeling of relief.

108
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:52,053
Mom.

109
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:54,053
Ever since I was young,

110
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,293
you've been giving me the idea

111
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:57,373
that I'll have no value

112
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:58,694
and purpose in my life

113
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,493
if I give up ballet.

114
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:02,613
Now, I've grown up.

115
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,454
I have my thoughts.

116
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:05,373
I know

117
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,894
my value is not dictated

118
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:07,574
by my academic results

119
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:09,373
or ballet.

120
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:10,933
I no longer want to help you fulfill

121
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:12,253
your dreams anymore.

122
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:16,094
Xu Jingjing,

123
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,574
I can't believe you guys did that.

124
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,654
We can't just watch

125
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:21,534
Jingjing miss out

126
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,493
on her dream.

127
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:23,694
What if

128
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:25,214
she regrets it forever?

129
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,334
At least,

130
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:27,813
you can discuss this with us.

131
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:28,853
Now, you turned your parents

132
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,373
into your accomplice.

133
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:32,733
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,253
Actually,

135
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:43,493
there's one more important thing

136
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:44,334
that I didn't tell you.

137
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:45,733
You have more?

138
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,214
Why don't you just tell us

139
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:50,654
all the shocking news
you have all at once?

140
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:51,534
My heart is about to collapse

141
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:53,173
because of her.

142
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:53,974
At the hospital,

143
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,334
I saw Kang Jiawei's dad.

144
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,053
Kang Jiawei's dad?

145
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,493
His dad has liver cancer
and needs surgery.

146
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:03,014
Liver cancer?

147
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:03,894
Then...

148
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:06,094
Then his dad wasn't away
on a business trip.

149
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,534
His dad also told me

150
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,173
not to let Kang Jiawei know about this.

151
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:13,134
He's right.

152
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:14,853
You can't tell him.

153
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:15,733
Think about it.

154
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:16,334
I agree.

155
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:17,933
Things are hectic
among the Grade 12 students.

156
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,334
If you tell him,

157
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,813
it'll affect his studies.

158
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:21,334
That's right.

159
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:23,134
Is studying more important than family?

160
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:23,933
Wait.

161
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:24,334
Then...

162
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:24,933
You see.

163
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,373
His dad put up an act

164
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:26,974
because

165
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,413
he doesn't want his son to find out.

166
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:29,654
If we tell him,

167
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:30,613
it'll waste

168
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:31,733
all his effort.

169
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:32,414
Am I right?

170
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:33,133
That's right.

171
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,094
Think about it.

172
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,733
Kang Jiawei is in Grade 12.

173
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:36,934
With his hectic study schedule,

174
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:38,493
wouldn't that distract him
from his studies

175
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,013
if he found out?

176
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:41,174
Besides,

177
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,054
if his dad finds out

178
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,094
that Kang Jiawei knew,

179
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:44,694
can he recuperate without worries?

180
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:45,574
Am I right?

181
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:46,893
You must not tell him.

182
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,414
Don't tell him.

183
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:49,253
Yes, don't tell him.

184
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:50,733
If he finds out in the future,

185
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,253
he'll think I lied to him.

186
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,094
Jingjing, it's not that serious.

187
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,653
It's only a white lie.

188
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:56,853
That's right.

189
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,013
Don't tell him.

190
00:08:58,174 --> 00:08:58,814
Listen to us.

191
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:00,414
Don't tell Kang Jiawei about this.

192
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:04,414
Do you know

193
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,013
how suspenseful at the time?

194
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,094
I was baffled

195
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:08,174
when Gao suddenly went to the toilet.

196
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,013
I noticed Mr. Xu

197
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,294
was playing with his phone.

198
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:11,094
So I thought

199
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,214
if I suddenly asked him out,

200
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,214
he won't lock his phone.

201
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,613
Then you don't have to unlock his phone.

202
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:15,613
So how did you

203
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:16,814
unlock Madam Wang's phone?

204
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:18,094
What else?

205
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:19,253
I just guess.

206
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:20,334
Do you know

207
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,533
I've already entered
two wrong passwords?

208
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,013
I was so nervous.

209
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:24,653
So how did you find out at last?

210
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:25,733
I was thinking

211
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:26,373
about who Madam Wang cares

212
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:27,334
about the most.

213
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,054
That must be her beloved daughter.

214
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:29,893
So I entered

215
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,613
Xu Jingjing's date of birth.

216
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:34,574
As expected, it was unlocked.

217
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:37,974
I have to thank you guys this time.

218
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,414
Or else

219
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:40,373
I don't know

220
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:41,214
what to do anymore.

221
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:42,613
Then

222
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,253
your mom really left?

223
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,054
She went to my grandma's place.

224
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:47,974
It's okay.

225
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:48,934
She did the same.

226
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:50,253
She'll return in a couple of days.

227
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:55,373
What's wrong?

228
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:56,773
You look troubled.

229
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,054
Did you call your dad lately?

230
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:02,934
Yes.

231
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,013
We'll call when we're not busy.

232
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:04,773
Why?

233
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,294
Nothing, I was just asking.

234
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:09,214
Something's not right.

235
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:11,454
I'm sure you're hiding something.

236
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,294
Your expression betrayed you.

237
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,414
Tell me.

238
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:15,814
You see.

239
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:17,214
The results for art are coming out soon.

240
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,454
I didn't sleep well.

241
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,414
I didn't know a pig like you

242
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:21,613
would suffer from a lack of sleep.

243
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:32,414
Education...

244
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:33,814
Results?

245
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:34,893
Jingjing!

246
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,373
Jiaren! The result is out!

247
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,094
Mom, you open it.

248
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,013
Dear, you open it.

249
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:48,013
Why don't you open it yourself?

250
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,493
I'm scared, okay?

251
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:51,414
You...

252
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:52,334
Then...

253
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:53,694
Well,

254
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,653
she inherited her timidness from me.

255
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:57,454
Dear,

256
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,334
you're the bravest one in the family.

257
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,214
Why don't you open it?

258
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:02,853
Me?

259
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:04,454
Then...

260
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:06,454
I'll open it.

261
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:07,733
Open it.

262
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:18,133
Okay.

263
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,934
You're in the 3560th place.

264
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:26,934
This...

265
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,814
This rank is so much worse.

266
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:33,414
It's okay.

267
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:34,893
When it comes to art,

268
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,773
it's in the eye of the beholder.

269
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:37,574
Even that

270
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:38,454
Picasso...

271
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:39,013
Even if it's Picasso,

272
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:40,533
he may not get first place.

273
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:41,454
- Your dad is right.
- Am I right?

274
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:42,373
Jingjing,

275
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:43,733
your dad is right.

276
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:44,733
Well,

277
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,653
you still have
the college entrance examination.

278
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:47,214
-  Am I right?
- Yes.

279
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:47,853
You still have
the college entrance examination.

280
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:48,613
During this time,

281
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:49,893
just study hard.

282
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:50,733
During the exam,

283
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,454
you can give your best. Am I right?

284
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:53,893
I'm sure you'll pass
the undergraduate education.

285
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:54,613
I believe in your capabilities.

286
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:55,414
It won't be a problem.

287
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,533
Not a problem at all.

288
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:58,373
I'm in 3560th place?

289
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,174
Huh?

290
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,214
That's not right.

291
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:02,653
Jiayao said only results will come out.

292
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,094
They don't have rankings.

293
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:05,574
Then what is this?

294
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:07,094
I knew it!

295
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:07,773
You scared me!

296
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,373
You read my candidate number.

297
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,253
It's the candidate number.

298
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,613
(Drawing 75; Sketch 77; Coloring 70)
You read it wrong.

299
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,174
(Drawing 75; Sketch 77; Coloring 70)
Drawing, I scored 75.

300
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,653
(Art Unified Examination Results Total score: 222)
Sketch, I scored 77 and 70 for coloring.

301
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:15,294
(Art Unified Examination Results
Total score: 222)

302
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,094
How could you read it wrong?

303
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:17,334
I scored a total of 222!

304
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,054
What 222?

305
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:18,814
What does it mean?

306
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:19,653
What?

307
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:20,174
Did you pass?

308
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:20,733
Is it a passing score?

309
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:21,334
How much did your teacher say

310
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:21,974
to pass?

311
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,414
The passing mark is 200.

312
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,493
You scored more than that!

313
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:26,733
The passing mark is 200?

314
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:27,733
She did it, Dear!

315
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,094
We have a Little Picasso in the house!

316
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:32,653
That's awesome!

317
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,294
Let's celebrate.

318
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:34,934
Okay!

319
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,133
- Let's celebrate.
- Jingjing,

320
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:36,893
what do you want to eat?

321
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,373
I'm going to make it for you.

322
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:40,533
That's great.

323
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:41,253
No need.

324
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:42,294
Let's forget about celebrating
if it's what we do every day.

325
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:42,814
She's right.

326
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:43,493
I'll go all out today.

327
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:44,493
I'll take you out for a hotpot.

328
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,574
We'll move forward
to Fuxing University with success!

329
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,054
Let's go.

330
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:49,334
Excuse me, Mom.

331
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:50,773
What's the meaning of this, huh?

332
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:52,214
I'll go and get changed!

333
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:55,773
Two hundred

334
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:56,773
and twenty

335
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:57,853
two!

336
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:00,814
This score describes

337
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:02,013
your stupidity well.

338
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,773
Does this mean you have the chance

339
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:06,974
to go to Fuxing University?

340
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,773
One of the seniors told me

341
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:10,934
she entered Fuxing University

342
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:11,773
with a score of 206.

343
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:13,454
After that, some people

344
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:14,493
would choose another university.

345
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:15,493
But some

346
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:16,253
were not selected

347
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,533
because of general courses.

348
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:18,733
So I think I have a chance.

349
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,133
How are you going to thank me?

350
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,334
What does this have to do with you?

351
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:27,094
How is it not related to me?

352
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:28,294
Who hung your name

353
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,853
in the tree at Fuxing University?

354
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:30,454
Who?

355
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:31,373
Tell me who that was.

356
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,094
Who?

357
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:33,733
Oh, the one

358
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:35,934
who cried
because he can't climb down the tree.

359
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:36,574
Shut up.

360
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:37,773
You don't have to bring that up.

361
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:38,454
It's not important.

362
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:44,414
I want to show you something.

363
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:45,294
What is it?

364
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:53,653
Notice of Fuxing University

365
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,054
self-enrollment quota.

366
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:57,054
This is...

367
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:59,414
Are these names enrolled or what?

368
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,334
It's a notice.

369
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,373
Who would issue a notice

370
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,373
for those who were eliminated?

371
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,893
Kang Jiawei!

372
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:12,174
That's great!

373
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:12,893
They're watching.

374
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,974
I don't care. I'm thrilled for you.

375
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:15,694
Kang Jiawei.

376
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:16,454
Does that mean

377
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:17,814
we can attend the same university?

378
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:18,694
But

379
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:19,694
you must not slack off

380
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:20,653
on your general classes.

381
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:21,373
You have six months to go.

382
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,054
You need to focus on your studies.

383
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:23,574
Of course.

384
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:24,694
Anyone who fails is a dog.

385
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:25,493
It's a deal, then.

386
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:27,414
Who fails

387
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,253
is a dog.

388
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,410
(Inpatient Building)

389
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,493
So that's basically it.

390
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,253
Why are you only telling me now?

391
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:46,454
I didn't expect

392
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:48,054
it'll get worse.

393
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:52,974
Does Wei know about this?

394
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,253
I can't tell him.

395
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:55,853
I don't want it to affect
his college entrance examination.

396
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:58,214
Okay.

397
00:14:58,853 --> 00:14:59,574
I'll take a flight back.

398
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:01,574
Will it affect your work?

399
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:02,814
Is that important now?

400
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:04,253
Why are you saying this?

401
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:05,454
Thanks.

402
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:29,893
Jiayao doesn't look happy

403
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:31,214
these two days.

404
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,054
How much did she score?

405
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:34,653
She scored 230.

406
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:36,653
Isn't that good?

407
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,373
Do you think

408
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,454
she's a little disappointed

409
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:41,694
about having our scores close
to each other

410
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:42,773
when she has studied longer than I did?

411
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:44,054
That's not your fault.

412
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:45,533
That's because you excelled.

413
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,653
I should talk to her.

414
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,054
If it's what you said,

415
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,174
the last person she wants to see

416
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:51,893
is you.

417
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,054
Just leave her alone.

418
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,133
But she looks...

419
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,253
Let time handle it.

420
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:00,653
Wang Jiayao will come around.

421
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:02,974
The most important for you to do

422
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:04,574
is to focus

423
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,653
on your general courses.

424
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:09,733
Eat.

425
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:36,694
Why are you here?

426
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:38,653
I...

427
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,773
I just...

428
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:48,454
Well, I...

429
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,814
If you're unhappy,

430
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,414
you can punch me.

431
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:56,373
You can punch here.

432
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,294
Punch it hard.

433
00:16:58,653 --> 00:16:59,773
You'll feel better after you vent it.

434
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,893
I'm serious. Do it.

435
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:09,573
It's okay. Do it again.

436
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,614
Jiayao, you're pretty strong.

437
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:28,773
Here.

438
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:29,773
If you're unhappy,

439
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:31,374
you'll feel better
after taking something sweet.

440
00:17:51,174 --> 00:17:52,333
Is it because of the examination
for fine arts?

441
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:56,733
You scored 230 marks.

442
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:57,813
Your chances
of entering Fuxing University

443
00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:58,733
are pretty high.

444
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:00,573
Why are you still unhappy?

445
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:03,013
I just hate myself.

446
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:06,733
Why?

447
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:09,934
I study art

448
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,414
since I was a kid.

449
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:13,733
Every weekend,

450
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:15,414
others would study

451
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,053
while I drew.

452
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,854
But Xu Jingjing only took six months

453
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:21,974
to catch up with me.

454
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,253
I thought...

455
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:26,974
But her marks are lower than yours.

456
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,214
You don't understand.

457
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:31,053
She could score 222 marks

458
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:32,694
in such a short time.

459
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,733
This is talent.

460
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:37,013
You have talents too.

461
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:38,654
Do you know

462
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:39,414
I hang the painting

463
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:40,654
you gave me
for my Coming-of-age Ceremony

464
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:42,533
in my room?

465
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,253
When my dad and Gao Zhan's mom saw it,

466
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:46,773
they said you drew very well

467
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:47,934
and you were very talented.

468
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:48,854
I'm serious.

469
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:50,894
It's true.

470
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,093
I practiced hard.

471
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,894
Have you heard of this saying?

472
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:00,854
"They don't receive
despite racking one's brain.

473
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:03,614
But the innocent and unaffected
receive it."

474
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,813
It's referring to Jingjing and me.

475
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,374
Every time I look at her,

476
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:12,854
I'd ask myself

477
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:15,894
why I'm still drawing.

478
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,573
Some people are just born

479
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:18,654
with high understanding.

480
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:20,813
We can't deny

481
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:21,733
all

482
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:23,253
of our hard work

483
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,333
and effort

484
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:25,374
because of

485
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:26,573
their existence.

486
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:28,654
If everyone thinks like you,

487
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:29,733
the rest

488
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,093
should just give up painting

489
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:33,293
because of people like Vincent van Gough

490
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,854
and Leonardo vin Daci.

491
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,813
You meant to say
Leonardo da Vinci, right?

492
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:40,573
Yes,

493
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,293
that Leonardo da Vinci.

494
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:45,733
You...

495
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,174
Thank you,

496
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:49,374
Dapeng.

497
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:51,533
I know you're comforting me.

498
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:52,854
No.

499
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:54,293
I wasn't doing that.

500
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:56,093
I was only expressing

501
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,174
what was in my heart.

502
00:19:59,013 --> 00:19:59,493
Did

503
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,253
you sneak to Fuxing University

504
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:03,694
to hang a card to pray
for blessings for me?

505
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:09,333
Uh...

506
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:12,454
How did you know?

507
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,414
Jingjing told me.

508
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,174
Thank you.

509
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,533
It wasn't a big deal.

510
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:23,813
Not a big deal at all.

511
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,293
It's not worth mentioning it.

512
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:39,533
Have some fruit.

513
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:40,454
Okay.

514
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:42,894
Here's a tissue.

515
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,253
I heard it's torturous

516
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:48,414
to suffer liver cancer.

517
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,854
How old is he anyway

518
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:53,974
to suffer such a disease?

519
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:55,013
You're right.

520
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,174
I think he's about our age.

521
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:59,533
We need to take care of our health now.

522
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:01,934
I've been thinking

523
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,454
about this for the past two days.

524
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,333
I wonder

525
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:06,454
how he's doing now.

526
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:08,374
Say...

527
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,773
Even if the surgery was a success,

528
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,573
can he take care of Kang Jiawei

529
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,533
under such a health condition?

530
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:18,813
Why don't we...

531
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:19,533
Why don't

532
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:21,093
we help him?

533
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:22,533
I was thinking about that too.

534
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:24,174
Tell me how we can help him.

535
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:25,093
You see.

536
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:26,493
He's in Grade 12 now.

537
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,013
At such an important time,

538
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,374
he's alone at home

539
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:31,214
with no family or relatives to help him.

540
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,733
But anyone with relatives

541
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:33,614
wouldn't

542
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:34,573
let a 12th grader

543
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:35,974
live alone.

544
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:37,773
See how pitiful he is?

545
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:38,533
Yes.

546
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,253
If you ask me,

547
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:43,013
we should ask Kang Jiawei
to stay with us.

548
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:44,493
He can stay at our house.

549
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,053
We can afford to provide for him.

550
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:47,454
Stay at our house?

551
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:51,174
That's not right.

552
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:52,093
How is it not right?

553
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:52,854
You see.

554
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:53,694
Jingjing

555
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:54,854
and Kang Jiawei

556
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,374
are youngsters.

557
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:58,214
A young man and a young girl...

558
00:21:59,053 --> 00:21:59,974
That's out of the question.

559
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:00,934
Why are you

560
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:01,773
so complicated?

561
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:02,773
Me? Complicated?

562
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:03,894
Jingjing clearly

563
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:04,974
told us

564
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,654
that he's her guy best friend.

565
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:10,214
Besides,

566
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:11,214
they won't be staying here

567
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:12,053
by themselves.

568
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:13,454
There are still us living

569
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:14,333
in this house.

570
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,093
You saw

571
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:17,493
how Jingjing's academic performance

572
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:18,533
had improved so much.

573
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:19,253
It's all thanks to

574
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,454
Kang Jiawei's contribution.

575
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:21,454
Have we ever properly

576
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:22,694
thanked him for that?

577
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:24,614
Now, his family is facing
some difficulties.

578
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:25,654
Are you going

579
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,134
to sit by and do nothing?

580
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:32,894
Over here!

581
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:34,214
Kick it!

582
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:37,813
Did your parents really say that?

583
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,053
My parents suggested it.

584
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,093
My mom said you're in Grade 12 now.

585
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:43,614
You can't live alone.

586
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:45,174
So...

587
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:46,374
What do you think?

588
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:47,134
I...

589
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,573
Does that mean I get

590
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:52,694
to see your true colors?

591
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:54,333
No, I can't.

592
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:55,573
I can't. I won't be able to handle it.

593
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,013
If I see it, I'll...

594
00:22:58,773 --> 00:22:59,773
What do you mean by that?

595
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,174
I'm a goddess at home,

596
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:01,894
okay?

597
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:03,013
It's okay, Xu Jingjing.

598
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:04,733
Don't feel pressured

599
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:05,454
because of me.

600
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:06,573
Just be yourself.

601
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:07,614
You can pick your toenails

602
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:08,293
and fart whenever you want.

603
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,214
I'll pretend not to notice.
So just be yourself.

604
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:13,134
Come here.

605
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,654
Come here!

606
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:15,854
You're the one who farts...

607
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,053
- and picks your toenails!
- Just fart.

608
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:18,654
Why are they still not home
at this hour?

609
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:19,614
There they are.

610
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:20,253
Mom.

611
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:21,533
Kang, there you are.

612
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,773
Kang, let me help you with your luggage.

613
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:23,414
Welcome.

614
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,214
Go and wash your hands.

615
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:26,013
Dinner will be ready soon.

616
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:27,293
Stop right there, Kang.

617
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,654
Take a seat first.

618
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:30,174
No hurry.

619
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,293
Let him wash his hands first.

620
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:31,934
He can sit first.

621
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:32,614
It's dinner time.

622
00:23:32,773 --> 00:23:33,694
Let him rest before washing his hands.

623
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:34,333
No hurry.

624
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,454
- Wash hands first.
- No, rest first.

625
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:36,253
Dad! Mom!

626
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:37,214
You don't have

627
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:38,333
to treat him like a guest.

628
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:39,733
He's here to freeload.

629
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:40,573
Hey.

630
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,694
You freeload longer than he does.

631
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,253
Just ignore her.

632
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:45,894
I'm used to it.

633
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,093
You must not
let her treat you like this.

634
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:48,694
Where are your manners?

635
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:49,573
Kang, don't worry.

636
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:50,573
I've already made the arrangement.

637
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:51,293
Tonight,

638
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:52,614
her mom will sleep on the sofa.

639
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:54,694
We'll share the bed.

640
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:56,573
I don't think that's a good idea.

641
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:57,854
I can sleep in the living room.

642
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:58,934
Oh, no.

643
00:23:59,093 --> 00:23:59,614
You're our guest.

644
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,374
We can't let you sleep
in the living room.

645
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,053
She's right.

646
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:03,253
You must sleep in the bed.

647
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,053
We treat our guests
with the highest courtesy.

648
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:05,894
- Am I right?
- Yes.

649
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:06,654
Take a seat first.

650
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:07,694
We'll clean up the room for you.

651
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:08,533
Dinner will be ready soon.

652
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:09,573
Jingjing, get him some water.

653
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:10,293
Just sit.

654
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:11,134
Okay.

655
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,614
We must always find

656
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:15,694
these five points

657
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:16,974
before connecting them

658
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:18,134
to make a smooth curve.

659
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:19,934
Then we can get the graph
for the sine function.

660
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:22,493
When the "X" determines the area...

661
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:24,614
Freshly squeezed watermelon juice
is here.

662
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,253
One glass for each.

663
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:28,573
Dad,

664
00:24:29,174 --> 00:24:30,614
we haven't finished the orange juice.

665
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,093
Apple juice too.

666
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,134
Well, it's always right

667
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,733
to replenish Vitamin C, right?

668
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:36,894
Why do you keep coming here?

669
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:37,974
I was about to have some ideas.

670
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:39,174
But you distracted me.

671
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:39,773
What?

672
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:41,093
I'm only concerned about you guys.

673
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:43,053
Can you see how late it is now?

674
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:44,694
You should rest early.
Don't tire yourself out.

675
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,293
Get some rest early.

676
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:54,974
How about we stop here?

677
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:55,773
No,

678
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:57,374
I want to continue studying.

679
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:01,733
If you can find

680
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:03,214
the five points in graphs similar

681
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:04,454
to the sine function,

682
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:05,654
you can find this.

683
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,454
That's enough.

684
00:25:10,654 --> 00:25:12,053
Keep it down. What's your problem?

685
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:14,374
Why can't you trust

686
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,374
your daughter?

687
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,733
Of course, I trust her.

688
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:17,974
But I'm still

689
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:19,934
a little worried.

690
00:25:20,414 --> 00:25:21,974
Why would you want to worry?

691
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:23,533
Didn't Jingjing say

692
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:24,894
that she's only a friend

693
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:26,573
with Kang Jiawei?

694
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,854
Did you say just friends?

695
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:30,134
Back in those days,

696
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,214
we were just friends too.

697
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:32,093
Look at us now.

698
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:33,614
Are we still just friends?

699
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:35,253
Don't compare yourself

700
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,013
with Kang Jiawei.

701
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,454
Can you be compared to him?

702
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:38,333
We're both men.

703
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:38,934
Why can't I compare

704
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:39,974
with him?

705
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:40,694
Listen.

706
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,013
You better watch yourself tonight.

707
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:42,934
Don't snore

708
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:44,854
and disturb Kang Jiawei sleeping.

709
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:47,013
I'll try my best.

710
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:52,894
What should I do?

711
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:53,974
I still can't memorize

712
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:55,253
the central administrative system
of ancient China.

713
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,174
You can just use
the memory palace technique.

714
00:25:58,694 --> 00:25:59,374
You see.

715
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,013
It's filled with the milk tea shop,
the school cooperative,

716
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,654
and other knowledge.

717
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,093
There is not enough space.

718
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:09,333
Well,

719
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:10,174
the truth is

720
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,214
this memory palace technique

721
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:14,733
is not necessary

722
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:17,533
to memorize familiar places.

723
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:19,533
It can also be used to remember

724
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:20,934
people you're familiar with.

725
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:22,253
People?

726
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:24,934
Tell me

727
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:26,214
which one you can't memorize.

728
00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:29,053
All of them.

729
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:32,374
Let's say the Qin dynasty.

730
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,333
It adopted the Three Lords
and Nine Ministers system.

731
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:35,813
You see.

732
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:37,214
I have three hair whorls on my crown.

733
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:38,614
Does the outline of my ear

734
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,253
look like the number nine?

735
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,654
Now, the Sui and Tang's
Three Departments and Six Ministries.

736
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:45,253
Among these ten fingers,

737
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:47,093
there are three straight fingers.

738
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,293
There are white crescents
on the six fingernails.

739
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:50,374
Look at my face.

740
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,773
In the Northern Song Dynasty,
there were three deputy prime ministers.

741
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,493
They were all handsome

742
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:55,374
like me

743
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:57,854
with three symmetrical proportions.

744
00:26:58,093 --> 00:26:59,134
Finally, the Yuan dynasty.

745
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,573
The highest administrative organization
of the Yuan dynasty

746
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:02,493
was the central province.

747
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:03,934
You see.

748
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,093
Do I have a high nose bridge,

749
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:08,694
and is it in the middle of my face?

750
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,293
You only need to remember me.

751
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:12,854
Then you can memorize

752
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,214
the central administrative system
of ancient China.

753
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:18,694
So

754
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:21,894
your nose is the central province.

755
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:25,773
The three deputy prime ministers
of the Northern Song dynasty

756
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:27,813
correspond

757
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,374
with your three symmetrical
facial proportions.

758
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:30,134
Time for some walnuts
to nourish your brains.

759
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,253
Stop it!

760
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:35,493
I thought you were studying.

761
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,614
Why are you touching his face

762
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:37,533
when you're studying?

763
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:38,454
Did she?

764
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:39,374
Ah, I think she did.

765
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:40,614
Yes, she did touch my face.

766
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:42,493
I mean, she didn't touch my face.

767
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,454
We were doing

768
00:27:43,654 --> 00:27:44,854
a memorization technique
from ancient Greek.

769
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:46,454
It is broad, profound, and varies.

770
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:47,654
What matters most

771
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:49,013
is the method.

772
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:50,253
Is that so?

773
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:54,093
Okay.

774
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:56,214
This memorization is pretty peculiar.

775
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:01,533
For your brains.

776
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:36,414
Jiayao,

777
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:44,134
why do you keep avoiding me lately?

778
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:45,654
I

779
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:46,573
wasn't.

780
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:47,894
You still want to deny it.

781
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,694
Do you see me as your friend?

782
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:54,214
Can't we just be frank?

783
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,614
I want to apologize to you.

784
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:04,974
When the results came out

785
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,214
the other day,

786
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:09,414
I was not in a good mood.

787
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:12,414
You don't have to apologize

788
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:13,733
because of this.

789
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:14,454
I know

790
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:16,053
your capabilities
are not reflected in your scores.

791
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,333
No.

792
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:19,654
It's not because of that.

793
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:24,134
Actually,

794
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:25,654
on the examination day,

795
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:28,854
I heard some delinquents plan

796
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:30,934
to paint something

797
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:31,854
behind their paintings

798
00:29:32,694 --> 00:29:33,894
to ruin other candidates' paintings.

799
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:36,533
When I was in the examination hall,

800
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:38,414
I noticed your seat

801
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:39,854
was next to theirs.

802
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:42,253
I was worried.

803
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:44,333
I was worried the teachers

804
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,253
would place your painting

805
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,013
under their paintings

806
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:47,733
when collecting the paintings.

807
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,374
I...

808
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,414
I wanted to tell you

809
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:53,854
at that time.

810
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:56,654
But...

811
00:29:58,533 --> 00:29:59,974
Okay, don't cry.

812
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:01,733
It didn't affect my results.

813
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:03,614
It's my fault.

814
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:08,214
When I heard Snape compliment you

815
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:09,533
about your huge progress

816
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,214
and catching up on me,

817
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,293
I got scared.

818
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:15,253
I was scared you would pass

819
00:30:15,493 --> 00:30:16,694
and I would fail.

820
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,454
But

821
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,093
I went to see the teacher after that.

822
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:24,093
Stop crying. I don't blame you.

823
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:25,813
I still need to thank you.

824
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:29,053
I...

825
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,134
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

826
00:30:33,454 --> 00:30:35,533
I hate myself for making a mistake

827
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,533
in a moment of weakness.

828
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:40,773
I hate...

829
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,293
I hated that I was jealous of you.

830
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:46,253
Wang Jiayao,

831
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,454
do you think you're the only one?

832
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,093
I'm also jealous of you.

833
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:51,053
You see.

834
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,093
I kept on thinking

835
00:30:53,414 --> 00:30:54,454
Wang Jiayao looked so pretty

836
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:55,854
and painted so well.

837
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,053
She's also good at her studies.

838
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,454
But you just learned for six months,

839
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:00,733
and Snape said

840
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:02,214
you'll surpass me.

841
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:04,654
I was already doubting

842
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:05,733
if I was talented at all.

843
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,854
Or if I shouldn't take this path.

844
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:09,614
Wang Jiayao.

845
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:12,013
Snape said so many things.

846
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,773
But why do you
only remember these things?

847
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:15,493
Didn't he also say

848
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:16,533
that the general examination
of fine arts

849
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,053
is for examination?

850
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,214
It's about techniques.

851
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:21,293
It's different from real art.

852
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:22,253
Besides,

853
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:23,654
he often gives examples

854
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:24,414
in our beginner's class.

855
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:25,694
He said

856
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:26,974
you're the most talented students
he has ever taught.

857
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:28,934
He said you have a bright future.

858
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:31,214
Did he really say that?

859
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:32,773
Yes, why would I lie to you?

860
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:34,093
I felt bad when I heard that.

861
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,333
I was so jealous

862
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,894
that my teeth were sore.

863
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,493
Then

864
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,493
I won't yield to you

865
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,654
in arts after this.

866
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,374
In general classes,

867
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:47,493
are you going to look down on me?

868
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:48,533
Just wait, I'll surpass you

869
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,533
in the final exam.

870
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:53,174
Are you still going to cry?

871
00:31:56,053 --> 00:31:56,974
I feel sorry.

872
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:57,934
There, there. Stop crying.

873
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,293
Come and have milk tea
at my place tonight.

874
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:02,414
Heavens.

875
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:03,813
You're such a crybaby.

876
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,290
(Final Examination)

877
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,130
(Final Examination)

878
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:41,053
Jingjing,

879
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:41,974
try my fried mushroom.

880
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:42,854
It's delicious.

881
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,813
I have no appetite.

882
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,894
Is it because of your exam result?

883
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:51,573
I'm dead.

884
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:52,654
It wasn't easy

885
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:53,934
to pass the professional course.

886
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,293
But my results for general courses
brought down my grades.

887
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:56,654
I can feel Fuxing University

888
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:57,974
drifting away from me again.

889
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:00,733
I saw your test paper.

890
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:01,694
Didn't you memorize

891
00:33:01,974 --> 00:33:02,573
the information
for several questions using

892
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,174
the memory palace technique?

893
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,454
Didn't you memorize
the Franco-Prussian War

894
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,333
at this cafeteria?

895
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,974
I mistook it for the canteen.

896
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:17,454
Kang Jiawei,

897
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:19,333
your hair...

898
00:33:20,773 --> 00:33:21,454
I washed it.

899
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:22,733
I did wash it.

900
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:25,974
I washed mine too.

901
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:27,573
That's not what I'm saying.

902
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,493
You have the same shampoo smell.

903
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:31,733
It smells exactly the same.

904
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:34,813
What shampoo are you using?

905
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:35,573
I used

906
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,813
the anti-hair fall
and anti-dandruff shampoo.

907
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:38,253
What about you?

908
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:38,694
Well,

909
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:39,573
I used

910
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:41,733
deep hair repair shampoo.

911
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:43,214
Uh.

912
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:45,293
I want to get another drumstick.

913
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:46,493
Me too. I'm still hungry.

914
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:47,813
Xu Jingjing,

915
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,614
are you hiding

916
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:51,813
something from us?

917
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,013
Kang Jiawei is staying
at your house now?

918
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:01,894
Keep it down.

919
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,214
We may be staying together.

920
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:06,854
But we sleep in different rooms.

921
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:08,414
Tell me.

922
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,334
How does it feel

923
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:10,053
staying in the same house with him?

924
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:12,774
It's not what you think.

925
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:13,854
We...

926
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,493
We don't feel anything.

927
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:16,653
That's impossible.

928
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,414
I'm sure you didn't feel it attentively.

929
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,734
Please, Jingjing.

930
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:25,934
You must tell me

931
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,974
all the details of you two
being together.

932
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:29,573
Details?

933
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:31,814
There was such a thing.

934
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:34,334
But...

935
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,213
Morning.

936
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:06,013
Good morning.

937
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,974
That's not romantic at all.

938
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,173
Boring.

939
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:26,774
Was there anything interesting?

940
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:29,653
I'll count to five.

941
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:32,334
If you can't think of a solution,

942
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:33,213
I'll have to question

943
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:34,613
your IQ, Xu Jingjing.

944
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,294
Don't count. I...

945
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:38,133
One,

946
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:39,053
two,

947
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:40,093
five!

948
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:41,894
Why did you skip three and four?

949
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:43,093
You cheated.

950
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,693
You have to give me another ten seconds.

951
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,520
(Honey Roasted Walnut)

952
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:56,294
What's the meaning of this?

953
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:57,173
For your brain.

954
00:35:58,013 --> 00:35:58,653
Eat some.

955
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:00,254
Kang Jiawei.

956
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:03,053
Xu Jingjing,

957
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:04,573
are you too shy

958
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:06,133
to tell us?

959
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:08,173
You were together all day and night.

960
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:09,173
How could there

961
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:10,334
be no heart-fluttering moment?

962
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:13,374
Don't tell me

963
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:17,653
you really see Kang Jiawei as a friend.

964
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,374
Well, not really.

965
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,414
If you put it that way...

966
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:47,573
What a letdown.

967
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:49,013
It's so disappointing.

968
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,693
You made me tell you.

969
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,213
When I tell you,
you're not happy about it.

970
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:55,573
I'm done. I'm going to class.

971
00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:58,814
The winter break starts tomorrow.

972
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,013
Do you two have any plans?

973
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:01,613
Jingjing, listen.

974
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,093
You have plenty of time
during winter break.

975
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:04,814
You must seize this opportunity.

976
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,350
(Overcome the challenges,
fight for the entrance exam!)

977
00:37:33,974 --> 00:37:34,573
Mr. Kang,

978
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,734
Kang Jiawei is eating
and sleeping well

979
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,533
at our house.

980
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:39,454
He's also studying hard for the exam.

981
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,013
You can undergo your treatment
without worries.

982
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:42,294
Don't worry about him.

983
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:44,334
Xu Jingjing,

984
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:46,173
thank you for telling me

985
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:47,334
how Kang Jiawei is doing.

986
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,133
The surgery will be anytime now.

987
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,653
His mom will return to the country
to keep me company.

988
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:54,573
So don't worry
about how I'm doing too.

989
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:06,374
Xu.

990
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:08,374
We have to extend business hours

991
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,814
on a day like tomorrow.

992
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:12,254
We need to step on it.

993
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:13,934
You're joking, right?

994
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:15,013
I have to host

995
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,294
a wedding all day tomorrow.

996
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:17,734
If I go and help you out at night,

997
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:19,013
I'll die from exhaustion.

998
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,414
Do you have to go that far?

999
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:22,454
Oh, I get it.

1000
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:23,493
You want to exhaust me to death

1001
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:24,693
so you can go out and have fun

1002
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,653
with your guy best friend
on Valentine's Day, right?

1003
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:29,774
May your wish come true.

1004
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:31,093
You've changed.

1005
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:33,533
Stop joking around. I'm serious here.

1006
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:34,414
Tell me.

1007
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:35,934
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.

1008
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,334
After those young couples

1009
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:38,573
had a nice dinner,

1010
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:40,734
the ladies would want
something sweet. right?

1011
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,294
They'll definitely buy milk tea, right?

1012
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:44,173
Those who watch midnight movies,

1013
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:45,734
they'll buy milk tea too, right?

1014
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:48,013
These are business opportunities.

1015
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:51,173
But if both of us are not home tomorrow,

1016
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,374
what about Jingjing and Kang Jiawei?

1017
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:54,533
What do you mean?

1018
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:57,013
Are you feigning ignorance?

1019
00:38:57,374 --> 00:38:59,053
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.

1020
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:01,093
If we leave those two alone at home...

1021
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:02,173
Kang Jiawei

1022
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:03,774
is a boy.

1023
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:04,533
Aren't you scared they'd...

1024
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:05,573
Jingjing told us

1025
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:06,454
that Kang Jiawei

1026
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:07,653
is her guy best friend.

1027
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,213
Hello, Xiaobai.

1028
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,814
There's no change
of plan tomorrow, right?

1029
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:11,974
Jiayao will join too, right?

1030
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:12,934
Okay.

1031
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,334
Then our study group

1032
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,493
is officially formed.

1033
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:17,093
Tomorrow, Master Kang

1034
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:19,613
will be responsible
for answering your questions.

1035
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:20,974
See you guys tomorrow.

1036
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:23,533
Dad. Mom.

1037
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:24,814
Tomorrow, Xiaobai and Jiayao

1038
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:26,013
will come for a study group here.

1039
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:27,894
They're most welcome.

1040
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,414
Do you feel guilty
for misunderstanding the kid?

1041
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:39,693
All she thinks

1042
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:40,854
about is studying now.

1043
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,653
She doesn't think about anything else.

1044
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:51,053
Are you still a kid?

1045
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:52,974
Why are you watching cartoons?

1046
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,374
It's interesting.

1047
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:55,254
Change the channel.

1048
00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:57,533
Master Kang, we're here.

1049
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:58,213
Master Kang,

1050
00:39:58,493 --> 00:39:59,093
I've prepared a lot of questions

1051
00:39:59,414 --> 00:39:59,734
to ask you.

1052
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,414
Me too.

1053
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:01,254
Are you sure

1054
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:02,854
the questions you prepared
are related to our studies?

1055
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:04,774
Of course.

1056
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:06,093
Get them some water.

1057
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:06,894
Please have a seat.

1058
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:07,894
We've been waiting for you guys all day.

1059
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:08,814
- Come on.
- He even asked to serve water.

1060
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:13,013
Have some fruit.

1061
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:14,653
We just bought them today,
so they're fresh.

1062
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,173
Make yourself at home.

1063
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:17,374
Okay.

1064
00:40:39,454 --> 00:40:41,173
She always watches this cartoon
whenever we come.

1065
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:42,294
I don't like

1066
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:43,173
that green superman.

1067
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:45,053
Have some water.

1068
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:48,254
Drink this one.

1069
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:53,414
Why did you give me juice?

1070
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:55,854
Did you add poison?

1071
00:40:56,374 --> 00:40:57,294
What are you saying?

1072
00:40:57,613 --> 00:40:58,573
This is all that's left at home.

1073
00:40:58,894 --> 00:41:00,573
You should be grateful
that I'm giving it to you.

1074
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:01,693
Why did you offer it to him?

1075
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:03,414
Jiayao and I are your guests here.

1076
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:04,173
That's right.

1077
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:05,334
I can't believe you two.

1078
00:41:05,374 --> 00:41:07,093
Master Kang has to sacrifice
his brain cells

1079
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,254
to help you with your studies.

1080
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:09,493
Shouldn't he replenish some vitamins

1081
00:41:09,774 --> 00:41:10,894
with some juice?

1082
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:14,454
The nature

1083
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,374
of chances is accidental.

1084
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:18,414
So the answer to this question is C.

1085
00:41:22,854 --> 00:41:24,213
I can't take it anymore. I need to rest.

1086
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:25,774
It feels like my head
is going to explode.

1087
00:41:26,814 --> 00:41:27,573
It's getting late too.

1088
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:28,533
I have to go home now.

1089
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:29,254
Oh, come on.

1090
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:30,493
I told my parents

1091
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:31,334
that the four of us

1092
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:32,093
would have dinner together.

1093
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:33,493
Yes, it'll be nice to eat together.

1094
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:34,133
I'll order some food.

1095
00:41:34,414 --> 00:41:35,213
You better don't order food.

1096
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:37,173
It's a big day today.

1097
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:38,814
I want to have dinner

1098
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:39,974
with Xiaoqi.

1099
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,013
What's the big day today?

1100
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:43,894
Are you for real, Wang Jiayao?

1101
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:44,774
I don't know what day is today.

1102
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:47,454
It's February 14th, Valentine's Day.

1103
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:52,814
Come on.

1104
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:55,013
Wang Jiayao.

1105
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:56,814
Xiaobai.

1106
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:58,173
- Hey.
- All the best.

1107
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:05,573
- How about...
- Why don't...

1108
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:07,173
You go first.

1109
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:16,374
Why don't we eat out?

1110
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:17,814
Okay.

1111
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:24,414
Well,

1112
00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:26,814
don't get this wrong.

1113
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:28,493
I just want

1114
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:29,533
to have a normal dinner.

1115
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:30,854
Just a normal meal.

1116
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:32,533
I'll go and get changed.
