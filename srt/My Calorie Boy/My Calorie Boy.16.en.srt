Here she comes!

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,040
Xu Jingjing is going
to give us a big one!

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
Great!

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
Great!

20
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,759
Jingjing!

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,039
Jingjing!

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,680
Are you all right?

23
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,759
Let's go!

24
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,240
Oh, no!

25
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,520
I think Xu Jingjing is hurt.

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,159
Oh, no! Come on! Hurry!

27
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,120
Let's go! Hurry!

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,639
Move!

00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,919
Where does it hurt? Can you move?

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
What was that, Xu Jingjing?

33
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,400
No...

34
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,439
I didn't mean to...

35
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,520
You did it on purpose!

36
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,240
You just want to see me

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,800
embarrass myself
in front of the entire school!

38

Everything about Alice and the whale

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,759
was all lies!

40
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,960
I didn't mean to do that, Jingjing!
You have to believe me!

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,840
I didn't mean to!

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,080
You did!

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,199
Do you know how hard it was

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,919
to convince my mom

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
to come and see my performance?

46
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,439
I...

47
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,080
Jingjing,

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
I followed the spikes.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,319
But I don't know why

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,240
I knocked into you...

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
The Cheerleading Team
had no obligation to perform

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,319
with you guys

53
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,639
for the Culture and Art Festival.

54
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,919
I convinced my teammates and the teacher

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,000
to do it.

56
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,000
I helped you!

57
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,840
Why did you do this to me?

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,319
There's no proof

59
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,479
that Xu Jingjing
did this on purpose right now.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Let's not jump to conclusions.

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,319
I can't listen to this anymore.

62
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,479
What gives you the right
to blame Jingjing?

63
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,039
Do you have persecution mania?

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,719
Maybe you're the one

65
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,039
who stood at the wrong place.

66
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,879
I have the most stage experience!

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,599
There's no way
I would've been in the wrong position!

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,199
Jingjing!

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,800
Jingjing!

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
How are you feeling?

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,240
Where did you hurt yourself?

72
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,240
Is it painful?

73
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,240
Your leg is swollen!

74
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,240
What are you waiting for?

75
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,599
We have to take her
to the hospital immediately!

76
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,080
Right!

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,319
Let's go! To the hospital!

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,439
Take everyone back inside.

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's go back inside.

80
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,700
(Outpatient)

81
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,120
On the surface,

82
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,360
it appears to be a sprain.

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,120
But

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,039
we'll need to do another MRI

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
to know the condition
of her ligaments for sure.

86
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,080
Doctor,

87
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,599
how long will it take

88
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,479
for her to fully recover?

89
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,839
Will it affect her dancing?

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,800
My daughter

91
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,959
is going to join the dance academy.

92
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,279
As I've said,

93
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,720
we'll only know

94
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
the exact situation of her ligaments

95
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,319
and if surgery
or normal treatment procedures

96
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,360
will be necessary

97
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,120
after we do another MRI.

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,439
I'll help you guys
make an MRI appointment

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,240
for tomorrow.

100
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,360
Thank you.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,120
Thank you, Doctor.

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,639
How are you feeling?

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,759
Does it still hurt?

104
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,439
Do you think

105
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,600
Xu Jingjing is fine?

106
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,800
She probably sprained her ankle.

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,199
What if she actually
can't continue to dance

108
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,040
because of me?

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
Don't scare yourself.

110
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,839
Kang Jiawei,

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,279
do you believe me?

112
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,639
Of course.

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,560
You didn't mean to do that.

114
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,480
But she doesn't believe me.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,720
Do you know

116
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,759
what I'm most upset about?

117
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,439
I helped her chase away those hooligans,

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
made her a headpiece,

119
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,319
helped her film the video
for her contest submission,

120
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,800
and I even sold

121
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,000
my dad's golden microphone.

122
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,920
I thought

123
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,279
we could finally be friends,

124
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,079
but she still thinks of me as an enemy.

125
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,199
Xu Jingjing,

126
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,079
was that move difficult

127
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,439
for you?

128
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,040
No.

129
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,439
But we only practised

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,319
that move

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
in the Taekwondo classrooms.

132
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,360
We've never practised it on stage.

133
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,720
That's why Gao Zhan

134
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,199
marked a spike on the stage for me.

135
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,600
But...

136
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,480
I don't know

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,519
why it went wrong today.

138
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,560
Liu Wan,

139
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:09,959
we'll cover

140
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,199
the medical expenses this time.

141
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,439
This isn't about money.

142
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,160
If something happens

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,319
to Jingjing's foot

144
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,439
and it affects
her college entrance examination,

145
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,279
are you guys going to be able
to take responsibility for that?

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,879
What does that mean,

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,199
Liu Wan?

148
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:23,920
Jingjing

149
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,079
didn't do that on purpose!

150
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,639
Enough.

151
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,399
Don't fight.

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,439
Jingjing's well-being is more important.

153
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,680
That's her.

154
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
Xu Jingjing from Grade 11 Class 3.

155
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,800
I didn't know she was so vicious.

156
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Coming up with such an evil scheme
to ruin Xu Jingjing.

157
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,399
That's why they say you can't judge
a person by their appearance.

158
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,199
Indeed.

159
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,439
But for you guys,

160
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,040
I can tell that you three
misrepresent facts

161
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
and distort the truth at first glance.

162
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,240
Let's go.

163
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,879
Doctor,

164
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,680
is everything all right?

165
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Her ligaments weren't injured.

166
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,240
So

167
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,879
she can continue to dance ballet, right?

168
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,720
Mom!

169
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,759
Is that the only thing you care about?

170
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,240
Listen to the doctor.

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,279
She's young. With proper care,

172
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,319
she'll be able to exercise and dance

173
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,519
without any problems.

174
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,480
I'll prescribe some medicine

175
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,519
that'll improve her blood circulation
and remove blood stasis

176
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
to help her get better sooner.

177
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
Thank you, Doctor.

178
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,720
Everything is fine.
You'll be all right in no time.

179
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,079
Jingjing,

180
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,000
your foot

181
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,519
is fine now.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Do you want to let
Xu Jingjing know about this?

183
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,160
You tell her if you want.

184
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,360
Jingjing...

185
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,319
Dad,

186
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,399
you saw what happened yesterday.

187
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Do you still think

188
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,080
she did it on purpose?

189
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,360
How about this?

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,039
Calm down

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,440
and think about it carefully

192
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,679
before you make a conclusion.

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,279
Okay?

194
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
Before we start,
I have two announcements.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,480
First, good news.

196
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,279
Xu Jingjing's foot

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
is fine.

198
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,559
She'll be able

199
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,600
to return to school soon.

200
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,720
The other matter

201
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,200
is the most anticipated

202
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,399
placement exam.

203
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,000
Placement exam?

204
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
What's there to be excited about
the placement exam?

205
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,600
I haven't even said anything yet.

206
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,759
Don't be so agitated.

207
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,799
Miss Chen,

208
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,080
which class will you be teaching?

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,000
Art stream? Science stream?

210
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,519
I'll go wherever you go.

211
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,240
This is

212
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,679
a preliminary placement interest form.

213
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Go back

214
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,360
and fill in the colleges and courses

215
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,120
you're interested in applying for.

216
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:43,679
Based

217
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,200
on what you wrote in the form

218
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,559
and your results,

219
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,440
I will give my suggestions and advice

220
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,720
on whether you should go into
the art stream or the science stream.

221
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,679
For those with better grades,

222
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,559
you can consider

223
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,399
if you want to join

224
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,399
the advanced classes.

225
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,799
Not hungry?

226
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,360
Maybe put some mayonnaise on it?

227
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,559
Finally made you laugh.

228
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,600
Jingjing is fine.

229
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,200
So don't torture yourself anymore.

230
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,279
Jingjing is upset

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,759
because she was wrongly accused.

232
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,919
You've heard
of fighting fire with fire, right?

233
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:30,879
You're upset

234
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,039
because Jingjing blames you
for something you didn't do.

235
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,519
So think about something worse.

236
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,200
For example, the placement exam

237
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,679
and applying for colleges.

238
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,480
Just use another pain

239
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
to cover

240
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,240
the current one.

241
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Kang Jiawei!

242
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,519
You made me lose my appetite.

243
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,240
This is all your fault.

244
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,720
Well, you have to face it eventually.

245
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,879
How about it?

246
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,840
Have you guys decided
which stream you'll be joining?

247
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,039
I plan on taking the college entrance
exam for art students,

248
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,240
so I'm going with art, of course.

249
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,320
But I want to join the advanced class.

250
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't mind either.

251
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm happy with any course

252
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,600
as long as

253
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,279
a university in Beijing accepts me.

254
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,919
Why Beijing?

255
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,159
It's more convenient for her
to pursue Qi.

256
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,200
What about you?

257
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm sure Jingjing will follow Gao Zhan.

258
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,519
But he'll join
the advanced class, right?

259
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,360
So

260
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,480
are you going
to join the advanced class too?

261
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm just thinking

262
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,480
about how glad I am that Jingjing's foot

263
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,600
is fine.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,679
If it was bad,

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,519
then does that mean

266
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,960
that I crushed her dreams?

267
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,919
How is she supposed

268
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,120
to fill that interest form, then?

269
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,960
Just thinking about that has me scared.

270
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,840
Gao Zhan.

271
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,879
Why are you here too?

272
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,559
I thought something was strange,

273
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,480
so I came to take a look

274
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,960
and see if I could find any clues.

275
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,159
That's my sentiment too.

276
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,480
Look here.

277
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,600
A spike.

278
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
This is the spike

279
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,360
I made for Xu Jingjing to jump.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,440
But look.

281
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,440
Someone moved it.

282
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,360
You mean someone

283
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,840
wanted Xu Jingjing
to make a fool of herself.

284
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,559
How is your leg?

285
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
It doesn't hurt as much anymore.

286
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,559
Actually, I'm here to...

287
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,639
You're here to explain

288
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,519
for Xu Jingjing, right?

289
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,000
No, I...

290
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:14,879
I didn't...

291
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,080
I just wanted to tell you...

292
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,879
You're

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,879
an awful liar.

294
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,440
Go on.

295
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,120
What do you want to say for her?

296
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,080
Actually,

297
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
you were upset and angry that day,

298
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,159
so you thought she did it on purpose.

299
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,159
I can understand that.

300
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:35,960
But look back

301
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,000
and think about it again.

302
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,200
If

303
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,480
she really didn't want you to do well,

304
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,120
why would she make
that headpiece for you

305
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,399
and help you record
the video for the contest?

306
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,240
Besides,

307
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,639
this performance matters a lot

308
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,639
to her too.

309
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,000
If she didn't perform well,

310
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,480
she would be embarrassed too.

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,879
Why would she do something

312
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,200
that would hurt others and herself?

313
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,100
(Yuming Radio)

314
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,399
The stage is too dark.

315
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,639
I can't see anything.

316
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Stop.

317
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,960
There are only a few seconds

318
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,639
between getting on stage
and the beginning of the performance.

319
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,720
If the suspect

320
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,759
made any obvious moves,

321
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,200
there's no way I wouldn't have noticed.

322
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,559
You mean

323
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,240
the suspect is likely

324
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
to be near where the original spike is.

325
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,559
Then we can basically rule out

326
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
all the Taekwondo members.

327
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,600
Did you notice anyone

328
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,559
acting strangely

329
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,840
on the stage?

330
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,440
Excuse me.

331
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,759
I would like to ask you something.

332
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,639
Do you remember

333
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,200
seeing anything strange

334
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,559
on the stage

335
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,879
during the performance?

336
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,200
No.

337
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,360
Thanks.

338
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,440
I think the Taekwondo Club...

339
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,279
Li Huiya!

340
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,200
I have something to ask you.

341
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,679
We'll be going first.

342
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,480
Bye.

343
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,120
See you.

344
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,720
See you.

345
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,679
What is it?

346
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,000
When you were on stage

347
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,399
before the performance began,

348
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,440
did you notice

349
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,360
any strange behaviours

350
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,679
from the people around you?

351
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,559
No.

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
What strange behaviour?

353
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
For instance,

354
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
bending down

355
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,679
or crouching down.

356
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,360
I remember

357
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,799
Wei Xue got down to tie her shoelaces.

358
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,600
But that's not exactly

359
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,799
anything strange, right?

360
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,440
Mom.

361
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:47,919
You startled me!

362
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,639
What are you doing?

363
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,720
That's right. What am I doing?

364
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,080
Why should I feel so guilty?

365
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,519
Come on.

366
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,240
Let's go and visit Jingjing.

367
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,960
No...

368
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,240
Jingjing probably hates me

369
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,320
right now.

370
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,480
We're the last people

371
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,919
they want to see.

372
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,759
Oh, but we're still neighbours.

373
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,879
I mean,

374
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,679
we can't exactly

375
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,919
just stop talking to each other
for the rest of our lives.

376
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,600
Let's go.

377
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,200
Well,

378
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,799
would you be mad

379
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,879
if Xu Jingjing injured me?

380
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,440
That's impossible.

381
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,480
You're as tough as a bear.

382
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,759
Who could injure you?

383
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,279
Are you going or not?

384
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
Hey! Are we going or not?

385
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,879
You heard it with your own ears?

386
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,080
Yes!

387
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,600
I was delivering the homework

388
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,519
to Miss Chen,

389
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,240
and I saw

390
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,519
Xu Jingjing's mother enter the office.

391
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,960
Well, what exactly did she say?

392
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,440
She said Xu Jingjing's condition

393
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
wasn't good.

394
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,799
Something about...

395
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,000
Achilles Tendon Ruptures.

396
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Achilles Tendon Ruptures!

397
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,080
Didn't they say she was fine?

398
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,120
I thought

399
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,200
that was the case too.

400
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,480
Her mother said

401
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,200
that Xu Jingjing

402
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,519
didn't want us

403
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,600
to worry,

404
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,399
so she made Miss Chen

405
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,519
tell us she was fine.

406
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,200
Mrs. Xu also said

407
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,600
that she needed to undergo surgery,

408
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
and it'll take a long time
for her to recover.

409
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,759
She won't be able to dance anymore.

410
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,680
Won't be able to...

411
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,720
Can she still walk?

412
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
The odds don't look good.

413
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

414
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,039
I've been so busy
with school and homework lately

415
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,599
that I only managed to visit you now.

416
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,559
Have a mandarin orange?

417
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,799
Jingjing, I heard.

418
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,359
Heard what?

419
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,200
That you need surgery...

420
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,440
How did you know?

421
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,680
Does everyone else at school know?

422
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:44,680
No, no, no...

423
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,160
I overheard Gao Zhan.

424
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,559
Gao Zhan overheard it

425
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
in Miss Chen's office.

426
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,839
The others don't know.

427
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,359
None of the others knows anything.

428
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,519
The doctor says

429
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,119
that I might not recover

430
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,440
even if I undergo surgery.

431
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,599
Forget about dancing.

432
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,039
We don't even know

433
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,359
if I'll be able to walk again

434
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,119
or how long it'll take me to recover.

435
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:12,960
I will never

436
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,039
forgive Xu Jingjing!

437
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Never!

438
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,880
Gao Zhan said

439
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,799
he found evidence

440
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,319
of Xu Jingjing doing this to hurt me.

441
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,759
This is aggravated assault.

442
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,279
It's a crime.

443
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,119
I'm sorry, Jingjing!

444
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,200
Jingjing!

445
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,720
I'm sorry...

446
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
It was me...

447
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,279
I did it...

448
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,519
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

449
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,400
The starting point
of your final flying kick

450
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,279
is crucial.

451
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,480
If you jump too early,

452
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,559
you won't be in the centre.

453
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,559
If you jump too late,

454
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,039
you might knock into someone.

455
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,039
Before we go on stage,

456
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,480
I'll make a spike

457
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,759
on the stage for you.

458
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,720
Follow the spike,

459
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,720
and you won't go wrong.

460
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
I just wanted to embarrass Xu Jingjing

461
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
on stage,

462
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,319
but I never thought

463
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,319
that she would injure you.

464
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,400
If I had known

465
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,880
that you would get injured,

466
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,519
I would have never done it!

467
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Honest. You have to believe me.

468
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,240
Why

469
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,839
would you do that to her?

470
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,400
I did it for you!

471
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,440
For me?

472
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,519
I don't want to make excuses for myself.

473
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,039
I moved the spike

474
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,640
and caused you to get hurt.

475
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,599
These are my faults.

476
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,480
I admit it.

477
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,119
But did you really not see

478
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,200
that after you gave the slot

479
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,039
to the Taekwondo Club,

480
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,160
not only did Xu Jingjing

481
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,680
not be grateful,

482
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,839
but she even tried

483
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,480
to get close to Gao Zhan
during practice?

484
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,519
You didn't see

485
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
how happy she was

486
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,319
getting to be on stage with him.

487
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,799
But I...

488
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,359
That's enough, Wei Xue!

489
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,599
Can you stop

490
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,960
worrying about me needlessly?

491
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,119
What does Gao Zhan being close to her,

492
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,440
have anything to do with me?

493
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,240
Your... Your leg...

494
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,039
My leg is fine.

495
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
I lied.

496
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,920
Then, Gao Zhan and Kang Jiawei...

497
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes.

498
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,599
They suspected you.

499
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,480
That's why

500
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,839
we came up with this plan together.

501
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
You guys tricked me...

502
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,599
Is that really the point, Wei Xue?

503
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,599
If it weren't for them

504
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,759
coming up with this plan,

505
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,839
how long were you going

506
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
to make Xu Jingjing
take the fall for you?

507
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:52,920
And me.

508
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,559
How long

509
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,079
were you going to keep this a secret
from me?

510
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

511
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,680
The person you should apologise to
the most right now

512
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,720
isn't me.

513
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,480
It's Xu Jingjing.

514
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,559
Here.

515
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,319
Have some fish.

516
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,440
It's good for your brain.

517
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,680
Jingjing,

518
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:22,960
are you still blaming yourself

519
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,799
for what happened to Jingjing?

520
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:28,880
Listen,

521
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,440
accidents are all too common

522
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,079
on the stage.

523
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,400
For instance,

524
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,200
a few days ago,
at a wedding I was emceeing,

525
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,319
the groom

526
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,440
was 150kg!

527
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,079
Guess what happened

528
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,119
the moment he got on stage?

529
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,039
The moment he stepped on stage,

530
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
the entire stage collapsed.

531
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,839
Collapsed?

532
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,440
Yes! It just fell apart.

533
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,440
But the bride was smart.

534
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,000
She lunged straight at me.

535
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,799
Didn't expect that, right?

536
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,119
What happened after that?

537
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,079
After that,

538
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,359
he was sent to the hospital.

539
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,119
It was quite a fall.

540
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,039
I meant the bride.

541
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,039
Oh, I didn't see it coming,

542
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,559
so I didn't move away in time.

543
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
You probably did that on purpose.

544
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,599
On purpose?

545
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,000
I stood...

546
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,480
Xu...

547
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,319
Dear,

548
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,240
it happened in a split second.

549
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,799
I couldn't have reacted that fast,

550
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,519
right?

551
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,400
I didn't move out of the way in time.

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,759
So, Jingjing,

553
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,599
there's no need to beat yourself up

554
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,799
over something like this.

555
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,519
It was an accident.

556
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,160
Besides,

557
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,039
Jingjing's fine,

558
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
isn't she?

559
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,799
That's right.

560
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,960
Come on. Eat more.

561
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,319
Oh, right.

562
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,759
The teacher asked us

563
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,680
to think about the stream
we wanted to join. Art or science.

564
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,200
Choose art. Listen to me.

565
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,079
What gives?

566
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,160
Listen to your heart.

567
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
No matter what you choose,
choose the one you want.

568
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,880
I've been through this.

569
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,599
I have experience. Go for art.

570
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,960
What does that mean?

571
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,359
Are you looking down on me
because I didn't go to college?

572
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh,

573
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
so what if I went to college?

574
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,440
You're the one who calls the shots.

575
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,000
Isn't that right?

576
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,160
What I meant

577
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,240
is that Jingjing

578
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,559
doesn't seem like
science stream material.

579
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,240
Look at her.

580
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,880
Who says?

581
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,799
Yes...

582
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
I'll support you

583
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,119
no matter what you choose.

584
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,079
I trust you.

585
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,759
I trust and support you too.

586
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,519
Who is here at this hour?

587
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,880
Don't tell me that bride of yours

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,480
is here.

589
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,720
Impossible. I told the bride

590
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,920
she was not allowed to come to my house.

591
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,640
The bride...

592
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,440
Jingjing,

593
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,400
listen to me.

594
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,440
Choose art.

595
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,319
Get an arts degree,

596
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,960
and we'll open

597
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:20,880
a matchmaking agency together.

598
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,279
You'll organise the events,
and I'll host.

599
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,039
Have you eaten?

600
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,440
Xu Jingjing,

601
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,799
a friend from school is here.

602
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,200
That is pretty much

603
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,920
what happened.

604
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,720
Sorry, Xu Jingjing.

605
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,039
You've gone too far, Wei Xue!

606
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,920
I know what I did wrong.

607
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,880
But can we please

608
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,480
keep this between us

609
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,799
and not let anyone else know?

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,559
So you're scared now?

611
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,960
Why didn't you think of the consequences

612
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,920
when you moved the spike?

613
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,279
You were right there

614
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,920
when I was being falsely accused!

615
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,160
I already apologised.

616
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,160
Besides, I only did it for Jingjing.

617
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:03,720
So...

618
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,960
You didn't do it for her!

619
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,440
Did she tell you to lie?

620
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,759
Did she make you move the spike?

621
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,480
No.

622
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,039
So you did everything

623
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,160
for yourself!

624
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,079
What are you saying?

625
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,240
I've always wanted to ask you this.

626
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,359
Why are you so concerned

627
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,279
about what goes on
between Xu Jingjing and Gao Zhan?

628
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,000
Is it because you also
have feelings for Gao Zhan,

629
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,200
and being around Xu Jingjing

630
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,400
is the only way

631
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,519
you have a chance to get close to him?

632
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,200
Don't spout nonsense, Xu Jingjing!

633
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,000
You know very well

634
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
whether what I'm saying is true.

635
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,480
Yes.

636
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,200
Xu Jingjing is a goddess to you

637
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,240
and nothing like a country bumpkin

638
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,000
like me.

639
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,000
So how could I get a chance

640
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,319
to perform with Gao Zhan?

641
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,880
But I did!

642
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:37,839
So you got jealous.

643
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,880
Am I right?

644
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,359
Can you stop using Jingjing

645
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,160
as an excuse?

646
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:42,799
When will you finally learn

647
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,160
to walk on your own?

648
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,559
Congratulations to Jingjing
on her return to Class 3!

649
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,839
Are you feeling better?

650
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:06,759
Much better.

651
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:07,720
Does it still hurt?

652
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,079
I'm fine.

653
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,559
That's good to hear.

654
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,079
For you.

655
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,920
As thanks.

656
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:23,960
It's sugar-free.

657
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,319
I did you such a big favour,

658
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,440
and this is all you're giving me?

659
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,759
You like sweets, don't you?

660
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,720
You can have this.

661
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,240
You can't brush me off with this.

662
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,000
Don't you...

663
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:44,920
Is... Is that all?

664
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,960
Was that not enough?

665
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,640
Yes...

666
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,079
Yes, this will do.

667
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,440
This will do.

668
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,319
I have this for you too.

669
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,400
This doesn't hold a candle
to my handsomeness.

670
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,240
What's with your drawing skills?

671
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,519
Couldn't you have tried harder?

672
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,519
Improve your skills?

673
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,839
Kang Jiawei,

674
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,960
I worked hard

675
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:20,759
to design this for you,

676
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,839
and that's all I get?

677
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,960
Give it back if you don't want it!

678
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:25,640
I want it!

679
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,000
I want it!

680
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,680
Did I say I didn't want it?

681
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,160
Master Kang,

682
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,039
thank you

683
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,160
for clearing my name.

684
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,559
If it weren't for you,

685
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,400
I might've never been able

686
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,480
to clear my name.

687
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:46,799
But when did you

688
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,400
investigate the case?
I didn't know anything about it.

689
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,720
Of course,

690
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,079
it had to be a secret operation.

691
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,359
Let me tell you something.

692
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,319
I questioned

693
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,720
a lot of people

694
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,599
and went through a lot of clues.

695
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,680
I dug deep and investigated thoroughly

696
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,599
before finally locking in Wei Xue
as the suspect.

697
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,920
All right, all right.

698
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,359
It's all thanks to you.

699
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:05,920
Right.

700
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,000
I will remember your kindness

701
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,319
forever.

702
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,880
I question the people together

703
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,960
with Kang Jiawei.

704
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,880
Gao! You startled me.

705
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,119
What did you say?

706
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,839
I said I questioned the people together

707
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,720
with Kang Jiawei.

708
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,000
That guy didn't mention me

709
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,119
at all, did he?

710
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,200
And I was the first one

711
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,759
to notice that someone
had moved the spike on the stage.

712
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,680
That was the key to solving the case.

713
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,319
So that's how it is.

714
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,480
Thank you then.

715
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,880
You really helped me out.

716
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,799
Oh, right.

717
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,720
For the placement exam,
are you going to choose

718
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,799
art or science?

719
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,440
I have to study art

720
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,400
for the course I want.

721
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,160
What course are you planning on taking?

722
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,759
What about you?

723
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,319
Art or science?

724
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,000
My dad wants me to pick art.

725
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,359
Good luck with the placement exam, then.

726
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,559
Xiong Shuai!

727
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,359
Give... Give that Cornetto back!

728
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,359
You...

729
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,880
I bought that for Yaoyao!

730
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,640
I licked it.

731
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,260
(Gao's Observation Notebook)

732
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:39,839
Here.

733
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,720
Thank you.

734
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,039
How is your leg?

735
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,839
Much better.

736
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,559
I have to thank you guys again,

737
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,160
Kang Jiawei.

738
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,240
Don't mention it.

739
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,519
Xu Jingjing kept going on

740
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,880
about how she was never going
to clear her name.

741
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,160
With her intellect,

742
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,000
there's no chance of her
finding the culprit herself.

743
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,359
It had to be up to Gao and me.

744
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,640
I still have to thank you two

745
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,720
for helping me realise
a friend's true colours.

746
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,160
Well,

747
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,680
maybe she wasn't really a friend.

748
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,559
Actually,

749
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,880
Xu Jingjing is quite upset

750
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,880
about what happened...

751
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:14,680
I know.

752
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,279
Everyone thinks she did it...

753
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,119
No, no, no.

754
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
More than what everyone else thinks,

755
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,559
your opinion matters more to her.

756
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,759
You have more friends

757
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
than Wei Xue.

758
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,680
Let's leave that aside for now.

759
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,279
What stream are you going to choose?

760
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
Science.

761
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,599
You have to join
the advanced class then.

762
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,240
I heard Mr. Tian from the Physics
Research and Teaching Group

763
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,839
is the one in charge
of the advanced class.

764
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:43,960
She is strict.

765
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,960
I know!

766
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,960
They say he is just like Madam Otose.

767
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,200
He is scary

768
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,160
when he collects papers.

769
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,079
Who is Madam Otose?

770
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,640
Gintama!

771
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,319
You posted that on Douban, didn't you?

772
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,240
Right.

773
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,079
I almost forgot about that.

774
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,319
(Grade 11 Class 3)
The use of these stylistic devices

775
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,039
made the article beautiful

776
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,119
and rhyme.

777
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,680
All right.

778
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,279
Jot down the key points.

779
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,839
We'll stop here today.

780
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:15,920
Class dismissed.

781
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,519
Xu Jingjing.

782
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,799
Why don't you take me home today?

783
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,680
Miss Chen knows about everything.

784
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,240
The others will stop talking about you.

785
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,319
I was wrong to blame you.

786
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,279
I'm sorry.

787
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,240
I just can't figure out

788
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,240
why you were so certain

789
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,039
that it was me.

790
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,279
I already

791
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,599
explained myself to you,

792
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,359
but you just won't believe me.

793
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,200
I thought

794
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,599
things were different

795
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,920
between us now.

796
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,039
I thought

797
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,319
we could be friends now.

798
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,519
I read a book before.

799
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,440
It said

800
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,880
that if two people

801
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,400
were to become friends,

802
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,400
they would need

803
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,039
to forgive each other's original sins.

804
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,359
Original sin?

805
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,240
If you want to become friends

806
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,599
with someone rich,

807
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,400
you'll need to forgive their wealth.

808
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,440
Isn't being rich a good thing?

809
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,519
But

810
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,440
if you're poor,

811
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,799
then their wealth

812
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,319
might sting.

813
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,160
So don't be jealous

814
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,720
of what someone else has.

815
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
If

816
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,079
you want

817
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:04,880
to be friends

818
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,039
with someone beautiful,

819
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,240
you'll need to forgive their beauty.

820
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:09,640
If you want

821
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,640
to be friends

822
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,720
with someone talented,

823
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,039
you'll need to forgive their talent.

824
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,119
Xu Jingjing,

825
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,400
do you know

826
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,440
what your original sin is?

827
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,880
Beauty

828
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,319
and talent?

829
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,559
Happiness.

830
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,119
Xu Jingjing, did you know?

831
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,079
Every night

832
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,519
after school,

833
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,799
when I'm practising ballet at home,

834
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,079
I can always hear laughter

835
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,119
coming from your house.

836
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,759
And every time I would wonder,

837
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,759
how your family had so many things

838
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,440
to laugh about.

839
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,759
Were there really

840
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:53,599
so many things

841
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,920
to be happy about in this world?

842
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,680
Well, it's because of my dad.

843
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,680
He can't stop

844
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,039
once he starts talking,

845
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,799
and my mom and I have to flatter him.

846
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,640
Your parents are always supportive

847
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,279
of your choices and decisions.

848
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,079
You wanted to learn Taekwondo,

849
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,440
so they let you go.

850
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,920
You wanted to draw,

851
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,279
so they let you draw.

852
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,200
You didn't do well on your exams,

853
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,759
but they always believe

854
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,200
that you'll do better next time.

855
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,200
Why does it sound like

856
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,079
you're throwing shade at me?

857
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,359
I'm envious.

858
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,000
Your parents

859
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,240
always have your back.

860
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,279
You always have the courage

861
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,599
to do what you want.

862
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,440
Sometimes, I'm not just envious.

863
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,279
Sometimes,

864
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,960
I even feel jealous of you.

865
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,559
I can never

866
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:40,839
figure out

867
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:41,519
how

868
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,319
to tell my mom I want to learn hip-hop.

869
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
If it weren't for Wei Xue,

870
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,559
I think your mom

871
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,359
would've accepted it already.

872
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,920
If it weren't for Wei Xue,

873
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,960
my leg might actually be broken.

874
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,440
Honestly,

875
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm not expecting her

876
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,920
just to be able to accept it.

877
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,960
But I have to tell her

878
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,000
how I feel.

879
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,440
The performance
at the Culture and Art Festival

880
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,719
was unlike

881
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
any other performance I've ever been in.

882
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,920
It was the one time

883
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,639
I really, really wanted to go on stage.

884
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,519
So

885
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,440
when I missed my chance

886
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,079
to be on stage,

887
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,760
I didn't know who else

888
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,719
I could blame.

889
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,920
My head was filled with thoughts

890
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,360
that it was all your fault

891
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,960
that I didn't get to perform on stage.

892
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,840
I was stuck

893
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:30,960
in that mindset.

894
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,119
I'm sorry.

895
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,239
Oh, I don't blame you.

896
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,840
You...

897
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:40,840
You really don't blame me?

898
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,880
Yes.

899
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Can we still be friends, then?

900
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,079

(Xu Jingjing posted this
in the Douban thread.)

904
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,679
(How could she not know)

905
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,079
(who Madam Otose is?)

906
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,360

looks exactly like Madam Otose)

Are you Give-up Virtuoso?

911
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,679
Do you use Douban?

912
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,440
No. I only use Weibo.

913
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,599
I was wondering how Xu Jingjing

914
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,920
didn't recognise the reference
where Chandler doesn't know anything

915
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,559
about football.

916
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,320
The time he did it
to get out of doing chores?

917
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,880
Even you know that?

918
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,639
What do you mean, "even I know that"?

919
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,480
I've been a fan of "Friends"

920

for ten years, okay?

921
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,440
It makes sense.

922
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,519
It all makes sense now.

923

so we can prepare ourselves
for what to expect.

Of course.

to get into the advanced class
for the art stream.

1004
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,400
I'll pass.

1005

If I make it,

1006
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:42,960
I'll have even less time

1007
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,119
to follow Qi.

1008
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,039
Wake up.

Are you guys headed to class too?

1018
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,480
I mean... What a coincidence.

1019
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,079

1021
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,559

to the canteen.

1022
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,239
Okay.

1023
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:16,880
We'll head on first.

1024
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:17,599
Bye.

1025
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,440
Have you had breakfast?

1026
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,599
Yes.

1027
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,880
What did you eat?

1028
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,800
Crepe.

1029
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,920
What crepe?

1030
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,280
Chinese crepe.

1031
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,639
I picked these up on the road.

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,920
Have at them.

1033
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,280
You need a favour from me?

1034
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,119
If you don't want it, fine.

1035
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,199
What has gotten into you

1036
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,440
and Gao Zhan today?

1037
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:16,360
What's the matter with you two?

1038
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,280
What did he do?

1039
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,519
What did he do?

1040
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,880
Why are you so worked up?

1041
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,239
Xu Jingjing,

1042
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,559
I have something to tell you.

1043
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,519
Go on.

1044
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,760
My online friend is actually...

1045
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,679
Listen up.

1046
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,199
There are a few of you

1047
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,960
who have yet to submit
the placement interest forms.

1048
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,280
I'll name them now.

1049
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,920
Ni Dapeng.

1050
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,320
Xiong Shuai.

1051
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,159
´╗┐Xiao Chunjie.

1052
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,159
Kang Jiawei.

1053
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,119
Xu Jingjing.

1054
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,719
Hurry up and submit them.

1055
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,119
Um, Miss Chen,

1056
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,159
I'll choose

1057
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,280
whatever Wang Jiayao chooses.

1058
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,039
She can get into the advanced class.

1059
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,880
Can you?

1060
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,400
I'll give my all
to get into the advanced class!

1061
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,079
Why haven't you decided yet?

1062
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:06,880
Don't tell me you're waiting

1063
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:07,639
for Xu Jingjing to decide

1064
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,840
so you can follow her.

1065
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,079
What does she have anything to do
with this?

1066
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,320
I...

1067
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,079
I... I just want
to think about it a little more.

1068
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,679
Oh, right.

1069
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,960
What was that about your online friend?

1070
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:18,679
What online friend?

1071
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,599
Did... Did I say online friend?

1072
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,159
You must've misheard.

1073
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,159
Have you decided?

1074
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,840
I don't know

1075
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
if I should choose science
that I'm good at

1076
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,559
or arts.

1077
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:42,800
I'm curious.

1078
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,559
Why would you want to choose
something you're not good at?

1079
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,800
Because...

1080
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,400
Because my best friend

1081
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,760
will be in the art stream.

1082
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,159
You have to know

1083
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,440
that true friends

1084
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:58,239
won't be separated

1085
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,199
by distance.

1086
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,000
Isn't there a saying

1087
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,360
that goes
distance makes the heart fonder?

1088
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,400
Kang Jiawei,

1089
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,000
this choice

1090
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,800
will decide not only
your college entrance exam

1091
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,800
but possibly even the direction
of your entire life.

1092
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:13,880
I cannot help you

1093
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,320
make your decision, but...

1094
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I hope you won't

1095
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:17,920
make a decision

1096
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,280
on impulse,

1097
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,440
all right?

1098
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,079
Kang Jiawei.

1099
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,039
You submitted
your placement interest form?

1100
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,280
You...

1101
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,639
- You...
- Is your leg any better?

1102
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,079
Much better.

1103
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,000
You...

1104
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,800
You still decided to go
with science, right?

1105
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,440
That's great!

1106
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,719
I chose science too.

1107
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:54,119
That means we can study

1108
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,440
and get into the advanced class
for the science stream together.

1109
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:56,400
But...

1110
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,239
I already promised Xu Jingjing

1111
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,119
that I would help her.

1112
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,280
She wants to get
into the advanced class for arts.

1113
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,679
Besides, I don't think there's much

1114
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,760
I can teach you.

1115
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,000
Xu Jingjing,

1116
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,039
I want to ask you something.

1117
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,760
Why are you imitating Xu Jingjing?

1118
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:23,559
Why are you copying

1119
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,880
what she posted on Weibo?

1120
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

1121
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,239
Xu Jingjing.

1122
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,719
There... There's nothing

1123
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,679
you can't tell me.

1124
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,719
You don't have to be embarrassed.

1125
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,800
You can tell me anything.

1126
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,239
I said I don't want to talk about this.

1127
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,559
But don't you think

1128
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,920
this is unfair to Xu Jingjing?

1129
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:44,719
Is Xu Jingjing

1130
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,639
the only one

1131
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,880
that matters to you?
