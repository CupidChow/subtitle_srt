Gao Zhan!

20
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,640
Gao Zhan, please...

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,480
Don't touch me!

22
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,120
Gao Zhan.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,519
Hear me out.

24
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,439
No need to explain.

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,519
Without my explanation,

26
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,679
you won't get the full picture.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,319
I don't want to know.

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,360
Gao Zhan, don't...

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,760
I'm talking to my mom!

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Stop yelling!

31
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:02,760
Can't I yell?

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,879
When did you know about this?

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
If you knew,

34
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,399
why didn't you tell me?

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,719
And I was wondering why
you're always around me

36
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:14,799
and why you get all chummy.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,279
I see now, Dapeng.

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,440
Gao Zhan.

39
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,360
I told him not to tell you.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,200
It's not his fault.

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:22,999
Mom.

42
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,440
Do you know Dapeng's father well?

43
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,119
Do you know

44
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:27,839
what kind of person he is?

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,640
Say that again.

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,360
Calm down.

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,399
Calm down.

50
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:31,920
Gao Zhan.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,959
You will not have my support.

52
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:34,360

Can you bring me to the theme park

this weekend?

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,160
Sure.

The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

65

during the midterm exam

67
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,279
so you're all getting cocky, aren't you?

68
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,279
Who's in charge of the morning reading
today?

69

Gao Zhan

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,399
but he's absent.

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
Xu Jingjing. Take the lead.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,519
(Humble and Adaptive, Virtues and Duty)
All right.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,159
Hi, Mrs. Gao.

74
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,399
I'm Ms. Chen.

75
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,880
Is Gao Zhan not coming today?

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,200
Gao Zhan is late

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
for more than 20 minutes.

78
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,359
He has never been this late.

79
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,519
Any of you called him?

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,599
I did.

81
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,399
He switched off his phone.

82
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,880
Is he sick?

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,760
You saw

84
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,640
Ms. Chen's reaction.

85
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,120
Clearly, she didn't receive
any prior notice.

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,479
But he never plays truant.

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,359
Something happened to him lately?

88
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:59,760
Please

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,399
stop conversing.

90
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,159
Aren't you concerned

91
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,359
about his whereabouts?

92
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,080
Of course, I am.

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,479
I think he won't come today.

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,240
What do you mean?

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,240
How do you know?

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,120
I...

97
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,599
Tell us

98
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,159
Tell us now.

99
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,080
Hurry up.

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,680
So...

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,760
My dad

102
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
is dating his mom.

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,640
that is hilarious.

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,440
That

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,359
certainly will be a meme here.

106
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,399
You can make something up

107
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
but not that ridiculous.

108
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:37,760
Dapeng.

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,359
You're hilarious.

110
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,359
It's not a joke.

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,839
My dad will marry his mom.

112
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,640
You're getting way into this, Dapeng.

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Wake up already.

114
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,959
I gave you an S rating

115
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,519
for your performance.

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,399
Is it that funny?

117
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,760
Is it?

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
So you're serious?

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Am I bored enough

120
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,479
to joke with this?

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
So you'll be Gao Zhan's

122
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,880
step brother?

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Gao Zhan doesn't like it.

124
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,640
Do you understand
these two gestalts now?

125
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,320
Repeat these two points

126
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,240
to me then.

127
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,000
Xu Jingjing.

128
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,440
What are you doing?

129
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,680
Spacing out?

130
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,000
If you don't want to study,

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,959
just let me know.

132
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,200
Don't waste my time.

133
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,080
Master Kang,

134
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,880
it just won't enter my brain.

135
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,279
What's the matter?

136
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,919
I'm worried about Gao Zhan.

137
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,719
He hasn't replied you?

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
Where do you think he is?

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,760
Maybe he just wants

140
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
to give his mom a scare.

141
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,320
Aren't you worried

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
that something bad might happen to him?

143
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,359
What should we do then?

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,959
I want to look for him.

145
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,320
Where to?

146
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,519
Remember my

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,719
Gao's Observation Notebook?

148
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,240
My notes about him

149
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
are more comprehensive

150
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,320
than his personal file.

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,200
His favorite restaurant,

152
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,399
his favorite bookstore,

153
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,000
and his favorite CD shop.

154
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,399
I have everything

155
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,000
about him.

156
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,880
What should we do now, Jin?

157
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,039
Gao Zhan has always been
a sensible child.

158
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,599
No need to rush things.

159
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,800
But

160
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,000
what if he does something reckless
this time?

161
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:44,120
Hui.

162
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,760
Relax. It'll be fine.

163
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,200
Pengpeng.

164
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,919
Did you say something

165
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,240
to Gao Zhan at school

166
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,000
that leads to

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
some sort of misunderstanding?

168
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,359
What

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
did I say?

170
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,159
He ran into you guys

171
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,919
when you were both in bed.

172
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
What in bed?

173
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:06,839
We were purchasing

174
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,800
pillows for you two.

175
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,240
The mattress was quite comfy

176
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,599
so we tested it out.

177
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
You could give the mattress a test

178
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,200
but why were you holding her hands then?

179
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,320
You...

180
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:17,800
Oh.

181
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,320
Do you know where

182
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
he frequents?

183
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,320
I have searched

184
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,320
everywhere I can.

185
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,479
Even his father's grave.

186
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,140
(Xinhua Bookstore, Sports Park,
Xtreme Swimming Pool, Salad Field)

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
Do you think Gao Zhan spiraled

188
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
and did something reckless?

189
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,759
Stop jinxing it.

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,839
Where can he be then?

191
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,280
Show me your stalker notebook.

192
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,560
You're a stalker.

193
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,119
His favorite place is

194
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,280
Phoenix Paintball Base?

195
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,959
He mentioned it once.

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,639
It's for...

197
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,759
Real-life Counter-Strike.

198
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,879
I visited the place often
when I was little.

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,639
Yes.

200
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:01,479
He said he would go there

201
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,520
every year.

202
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:03,999
So why aren't we there then?

203
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,879
I just checked.

204
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,359
It closed down half a year ago.

205
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,200
There are a lot of paintball fields

206
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:11,959
for real-life Counter-Strike.

207
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,560
What makes Phoenix Paintball Base

208
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,959
so special to him then?

209
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:45,520
Gao Zhan.

210
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,400
So you haven't eaten

211
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
until now?

212
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,080
I did eat.

213
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,879
But not as much as I do now.

214
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,839
How did you

215
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:18,719
find this place?

216
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:21,999
We...

217
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,520
Dapeng told us everything.

218
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,080
So everyone knows.

219
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,959
We are all worried about you.

220
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:38,920
Xu Jingjing said

221
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,680
you mentioned this place before.

222
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,280
So we came to try our luck here.

223
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:43,800
Gao Zhan.

224
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,119
Go home.

225
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,280
I agree.

226
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,320
Go home.

227
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,440
You can talk

228
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,719
everything out back home.

229
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,440
Did they send you

230
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,239
to persuade me?

231
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,839
No.

232
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,719
Not at all.

233
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,320
No one else knows

234
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,119
we found you.

235
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,239
Or perhaps

236
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,479
you can tell us

237
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,359
what you feel?

238
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,400
Maybe we can help you.

239
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,599
I don't want

240
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,479
a new father.

241
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,440
But this isn't about

242
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,239
whether you want

243
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,359
a new father or not.

244
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:20,999
I know.

245
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,479
It's about

246
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,479
my mother's free will.

247
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,080
Do you remember

248
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,239
Ms. Chen said

249
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,719
that everyone had the right

250
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,999
to choose how they wanted to live?

251
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,320
That applies

252
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,239
to your mom too.

253
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,359
Do you know why

254
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,160
I came here?

255
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:43,560
During Children's Day

256
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,560
every year,

257
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,239
my dad would bring me here for a game

258
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,280
of cop and robber.

259
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,040
We would have a match

260
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,759
to see who could win the most.

261
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,320
He said he would play with me

262
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,800
forever.

263
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:02,879
But...

264
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,080
Maybe I

265
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,040
am not ready.

266
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,359
I didn't expect my mom

267
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,639
to fall in love with someone else.

268
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,080
She remarries

269
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,879
and we'll have a new family.

270
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,639
Does that mean

271
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,560
we're abandoning my dad?

272
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,920
No.

273
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,639
You can't think that way.

274
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,080
Is it not the case?

275
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,520
I don't want to forget my dad.

276
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,359
You won't.

277
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,320
You mentioned

278
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,160
Children's Day.

279
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,680
Will you ever forget that it's on

280
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,440
the first of June?

281
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,359
No, you won't.

282
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,280
You will remember your father forever

283
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
just like how you know

284
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
the first of June is Children's Day.

285
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,759
Even if you don't

286
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,560
celebrate it,

287
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:08,680
it'll be there.

288
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,479
It's in the air.

289
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,040
It's in your blood.

290
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,759
It will follow you all your life.

291
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,639
Whose quote is that?

292
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,320
I came up with it myself.

293
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,639
Maybe you're right.

294
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,080
But I just can't accept

295
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:31,959
Dapeng's father.

296
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,440
I don't know

297
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,759
how to face my mother either.

298
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:41,200
If you don't know

299
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,920
how to face your mother...

300
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,320
Why are you looking at me?

301
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,239
Kang Jiawei,

302
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,520
don't you have a huge house?

303
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,479
Maybe...

304
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,080
Of course, I would love to.

305
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,440
Stay over at my place

306
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,479
until you have your answer.

307
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,719
You would help me?

308
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,800
But we have one condition.

309
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
You have to go back to school.

310
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,359
Everyone is worried about you.

311
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,520
It's okay, Mrs. Gao.

312
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,239
A change of environment

313
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,040
will help him.

314
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,719
Anytime.

315
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Sure. See you.

316
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,759
All right, your mom has been notified.

317
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,759
From now on,

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,239
make yourself at home.

319
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,800
You can stay here

320
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,719
for as long as you want.

321
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:43,759
Thanks, Mr. Kang.

322
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
Where should I sleep tonight?

323
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,959
On the couch.

324
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,639
No guest should sleep on the couch.

325
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,599
You can share a bed with Wei.

326
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,520
Dad!

327
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,520
It's not right.

328
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,999
Two guys share a bed.

329
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,879
What's wrong with that?

330
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,800
All right, that's all.

331
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll prepare supper for you.

332
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,680
Don't worry.

333
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,959
I don't snore.

334
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:11,839
Nevermind.

335
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,359
You're awake.

336
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,839
Where is my dad?

337
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,759
He made breakfast

338
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,639
and went to the office.

339
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:32,599
He said

340
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,719
he had a meeting.

341
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,599
Your family made such a big breakfast.

342
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,920
Xu Jingjing enforced this rule.

343
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
She wants to keep my weight in check.

344
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,879
And she said

345
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,759
we're supposed to have a big breakfast.

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,639
Here you go.

347
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,560
What?

348
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,160
You think my hands are dirty?

349
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,320
I washed them.

350
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,599
No, you're not dirty.

351
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,160
But

352
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,040
you can have it.

353
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,400
I'll crack one myself.

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,759
Kang Jiawei.

355
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,599
Why are you

356
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,639
avoiding me?

357
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,080
Avoiding you?

358
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,879
No.

359
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,160
If I want to avoid you,

360
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:27,999
why would I

361
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,160
invite you to my home?

362
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:31,599
Right?

363
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,160
True.

364
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,400
I suppose I'm overthinking.

365
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:37,520
Have it.

366
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,599
It's okay. I can do it myself.

367
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,800
Gao, you're back.

368
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,119
Morning.

369
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:45,400
Gao.

370
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,599
Are you all right?

371
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm good.

372
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,359
I have been messaging you

373
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,520
these few days

374
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,040
but you never replied.

375
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,400
My phone was switched off.

376
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:04,599
Gao Zhan.

377
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,159
The other Xu Jingjing

378
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,159
found you, didn't she?

379
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,960
Isn't she amazing?

380
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,919
Gao Zhan.

381
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,720
No more rebellion now.

382
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:14,359
The other Xu Jingjing and we

383
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,240
were very concerned.

384
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:16,919
Sorry

385
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,119
for making all of you worried.

386
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,040
Well done!

387
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,000
Xu Jingjing.

388
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,080
Morning, Master Kang.

389
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:32,639
I have something for you.

390
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,439
What's that?

391
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,359
My dad's design portfolio.

392
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:40,919
I told him to autograph it.

393
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,620
(Kang Minzhi)

394
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,720
Kang Minzhi.

395
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,040
Thank you, Mr. Kang Minzhi.

396
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,720
Shouldn't you thank me?

397
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,040
Extra meat for your lunch

398
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,919
and

399
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,240
10ml of mayonnaise.

400
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,359
Thank you.

401
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,199
I'll let you in on a secret.

402
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,159
Don't tell anyone.

403
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,080
What?

404
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,560
Gao Zhan

405
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,720
asked Jingjing out.

406
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,800
For real?

407
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,960
Say that again.

408
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,520
Am I wrong though?

409
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,599
Ni Dapeng?

410
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,119
Your dad

411
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,480
slept with someone from the school.

412
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,320
Did I say anything untrue?

413
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,000
You want to hit me.

414
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,040
Look here, everyone.

415
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,359
Someone from Class 3 is hitting me.

416
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,599
Take your phone out

417
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,040
and film this.

418
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,000
Hurry up.

419
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:32,839
Hurry.

420
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,000
Calm down, Dapeng.

421
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,199
Don't stoop to his level.

422
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,199
Don't stoop to my level.

423
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,839
If you have the time,

424
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,320
get your father

425
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,280
into that...

426
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,399
What is it called again?

427
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,119
If You Are The One.

428
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,199
Yes, that matchmaking reality show.

429
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,520
Childish.

430
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,080
How old are you again?

431
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,960
Wang Jiayao.

432
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,080
Who are you?

433
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,320
You think

434
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,520
your joke is funny?

435
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,960
It's either you lack a sense of humor

436
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,399
or you lack common sense.

437
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,679
The way I see it, you're single

438
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
and you're jealous of Dapeng's dad
because he found his true love.

439
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,960
Honestly,

440
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,280
no need to ask Dapeng's father
for dating tips.

441
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,879
Take the time to make yourself
look presentable first.

442
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,080
You...

443
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,119
You?

444
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,480
Do you know the female students

445
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,720
in your class say your feet stink?

446
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,679
And you fancy yourself the Yuyan Peng
of Yuming High.

447
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,000
Do you have no shame?

448
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,960
And you.

449
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,839
Do you have a mirror?

450
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,000
Put on some moisturizing cream.

451
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,280
Your cheek is peeling.

452
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,199
Is this funny?

453
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,800
How often do you wash your hair?

454
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,599
Don't act dumb. I'm talking to you.

455
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,919
A head full of dandruff.

456
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,240
If I were in your class,

457
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,800
I would rather die.

458
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:04,720
Let's go.

459
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Don't stoop to her level.

460
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,119
Let's go.

461
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,439
Don't leave.

462
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,639
I'm not done yet.

463
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,199
What are you staring at?

464
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,639
If you have the time to gawk,

465
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:19,839
do your homework instead.

466
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,159
Let's go.

467
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,639
Wang Jiayao.

468
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:24,800
I didn't expect

469
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,839
you have this side too.

470
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,240
You're a heroine.

471
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,280
And I thought

472
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,760
you were the scholar-type.

473
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,919
You have blown my mind today.

474
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:35,399
I can't

475
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,720
stand bullies.

476
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,879
Ignore them next time.

477
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:39,439
Let's go.

478
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,560
Wow.

479
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,199
What are you doing?

480
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,280
Are you still there?

481
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:55,879
Don't you think

482
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,839
Wang Jiayao is starting

483
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,839
to care about me?

484
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,359
No.

485
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,000
No?

486
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,080
No.

487
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,520
Wang Jiayao.

488
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:09,480
She...

489
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:10,280
We hardly

490
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
talk.

491
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,159
But today,

492
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,439
she helped me.

493
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,359
You know what this means?

494
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,760
What?

495
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:18,800
You're a blockhead.

496
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,480
She cares about me.

497
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,760
As expected from an artistic girl.

498
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,720
Her taste is

499
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:29,599
exquisite.

500
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,040
Sorry

501
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,679
for the long wait.

502
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,199
Dad?

503
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,280
Dad?

504
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,280
Xu Jingjing?

505
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:42,320
Why are you here?

506
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,399
Why are you here?

507
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,919
I work part-time here.

508
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,599
Is there

509
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,879
a position you're not part of?

510
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,679
I wish.

511
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,520
I have to earn more money

512
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
to feed you.

513
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,520
Quit?

514
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,359
Hi, this is my business card.

515
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,240
You...

516
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,399
Wait.

517
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,480
Who is he?

518
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,399
Why are you here?

519
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,879
Don't get us wrong, Mr. Xu.

520
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,800
Jingjing came with me so that I can
consult the matchmaking service.

521
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:07,960
She did?

522
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,240
Are you an adult?

523
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:10,839
No.

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,760
Sorry then.

525
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,280
We don't

526
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,520
entertain minors here.

527
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:14,480
Dad.

528
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,639
He's here on behalf of his mom.

529
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:17,119
Yes.

530
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,679
I'm here to find my mom a husband.

531
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,720
Wait.

532
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,480
I'm confused.

533
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,800
You came with him.

534
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,879
You came to find your mom a husband.

535
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:25,399
Such a wonderful son.

536
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,399
Wonderful.

537
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,599
Have a seat.

538
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,080
Talking to him

539
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,960
hurts my neck.

540
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:31,679
Come.

541
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:34,119
Tell me more about her.

542
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,599
She is 43 years old.

543
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:37,320
Widowed.

544
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,919
She's the editor-in-chief
of Jiangxin Publishing House.

545
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,240
She looks...

546
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
I take after my mom.

547
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,240
She must be gorgeous.

548
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,439
She graduated from Fudan University.
Chinese major.

549
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,639
She likes jazz music.

550
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,080
Her favorite author is

551
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,240
Garcia Marquez.

552
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:52,560
Gar...

553
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,359
Garcia Marquez.

554
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
A foreign author.

555
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,399
I know.

556
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,240
I know.

557
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
My mom

558
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,800
is quiet

559
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,919
and kind.

560
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,560
Her only shortcoming is that she's

561
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,000
gullible.

562
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,599
Okay.

563
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:09,560
I see.

564
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,080
So what kind

565
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,800
of men do you want

566
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
for your mother?

567
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,919
Do you have

568
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,320
nouveau riche here?

569
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,399
There is one.

570
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,639
Never give my mom a nouveau riche.

571
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,280
This won't do.

572
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,839
He's balding.

573
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,879
This is not good either.

574
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,439
He's too old.

575
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,919
He's

576
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:40,280
too fat.

577
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:46,960
You know what?

578
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:47,839
Stop browsing.

579
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:49,320
I

580
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:50,960
will do some research.

581
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,839
I'm sure I'll find a candidate soon.

582
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,560
However, for someone

583
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:55,560
like your mother,

584
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,560
a lecturer

585
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,919
will suit her.

586
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:00,720
Okay.

587
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
When can they meet?

588
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,199
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

589
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,760
Tomorrow...

590
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,919
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow...

591
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,919
There's no rush.

592
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,639
Romance only happens when it's

593
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,800
meant to happen.

594
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,679
Yes.

595
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,560
I'll do my best.

596
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,359
I'll do my best.

597
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:23,839
All right.

598
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,879
This is my mother's number.

599
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,199
You can call her directly

600
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:39,919
and tell my mother,

601
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
her son signed up for her.

602
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,919
Okay.

603
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,399
Make sure you let my mom see

604
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,599
how many good men

605
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,679
there are in this world.

606
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,839
They are better than a nouveau riche.

607
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,119
Understood.

608
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,119
I'll do my best.

609
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:52,040
I'll do my best.

610
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,919
(What is this?)

611
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,399
Do you think my mom

612
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,679
will get a call tomorrow?

613
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,000
Gao Zhan.

614
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,800
Why do you hate Dapeng's father

615
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,839
that much?

616
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,800
He's so different from my father.

617
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,280
Look at the gold chain

618
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,000
and the gold watch.

619
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
He cannot be more nouveau riche

620
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,679
than that.

621
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,000
But you shouldn't judge a book
by its cover.

622
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,879
I think his father is quite nice.

623
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,240
He even made our costumes for free

624
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,000
during Sports Days.

625
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,760
Don't bring this up.

626
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,080
It annoys me.

627
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,919
He was trying so hard to coddle me.

628
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,399
That means he cares about you.

629
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
He was pulling tricks

630
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:05,720
to bribe me.

631
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,320
When we were in the 11th Grade,

632
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,280
he sponsored

633
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,839
the cheerleading uniform
and the basketball jersey.

634
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,399
That's not bribery, is it?

635
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:12,879
I...

636
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:14,639
You have a prejudice

637
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,359
against him.

638
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,839
You refuse to know him.

639
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,199
I don't see the need to.

640
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,159
A nouveau riche like him

641
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,679
does not love my mom truly.

642
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,560
Gao Zhan.

643
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,439
I have always regarded you

644
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:30,080
as a rational individual.

645
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:32,280
You manage things with facts.

646
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
But today, you're being

647
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,679
impetuous.

648
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:35,599
I know

649
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,879
you're doing this for your mother.

650
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,520
But have you thought

651
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,599
that you're sending her

652
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,879
to meet a stranger

653
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,760
without her consent?

654
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,000
Also,

655
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,119
you're not the one who's dating

656
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:46,879
Dapeng's father.

657
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,839
How can you know

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,280
if your mother

659
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,080
is not happy

660
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,159
and is suffering?

661
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,220
(Best Dance Cover competition
is waiting for you!)

662
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,159
Xu Jingjing.

663
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,560
Are you free after school?

664
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,280
I want to show you a place.

665
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,560
Where?

666
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,119
You'll know when you're there.

667
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,720
Gao Zhan and Xu Jingjing
will be there too.

668
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,679
Sure.

669
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,000
Have a look.

670
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:33,359
I'm not sure if this

671
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,119
is what you're looking for.

672
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:38,960
It's amazing.

673
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,599
Better than any venue I searched.

674
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:41,560
Thank you, mister.

675
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,480
Don't mention it.

676
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,000
If there's nothing,

677
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,800
I'll head back now.

678
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,760
Stay safe.

679
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,399
Take care of your friends.

680
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,280
Don't worry, dad.

681
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,199
Bye, Mr. Kang.

682
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,800
Bye.

683
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,480
See you, Mr. Kang.

684
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,240
See you, Mr. Kang.

685
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,240
Let's check inside.

686
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,960
You look so cool.

687
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,879
You look like Alita.

688
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,199
Who?

689
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,560
Alita.

690
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:14,960
Battle Angel.

691
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,040
Cyberpunk.

692
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,679
She does look like it.

693
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,480
(So you're)

694
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,720
(Give-up Virtuoso.)

695
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:25,839
Oh.

696
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,119
What is

697
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,520
the theme of the competition?

698
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,560
It's not mentioned.

699
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,800
I suppose it's free for all.

700
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,839
So what do you

701
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
think of cyberpunk then?

702
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,280
I like cyberpunk.

703
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,399
It's very visual.

704
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:36,159
And it matches

705
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:36,919
with your outfit.

706
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,520
You'll be dancing.

707
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,679
Why do you need a helmet?

708
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,480
She doesn't want

709
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,679
her mom to see her.

710
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:47,560
You won't show your face?

711
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,240
What a pity.

712
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:51,839
Kang Jiawei.

713
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,280
How can you be this superficial?

714
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,560
The online voters

715
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,199
will be superficial.

716
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,639
I believe hiding my face

717
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,919
is more memorable

718
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,720
than showing my face.

719
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,560
Okay.

720
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:02,599
The costume

721
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,119
is done then.

722
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,159
Now, it's the background.

723
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,240
No need to be that fancy.

724
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,480
This place is already much better

725
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,919
than those unfinished buildings
out there.

726
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,960
When we do something,

727
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,439
we do it well.

728
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,119
You're there to compete.

729
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,240
Not to make others look good.

730
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,720
Right?

731
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,159
Then

732
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,520
I can try making the background.

733
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,520
That's what I've been waiting for.

734
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,119
I have never done one before.

735
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,040
But don't worry.

736
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,280
I'll give my best shot.

737
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,720
Let me know if you need

738
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,280
my help.

739
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay.

740
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:27,240
There's something.

741
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,000
For real.

742
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,119
Do my homework for me.

743
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:29,760
Bugger off.

744
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:31,960
You're scolding me again.

745
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,119
It's just a joke.

746
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,399
Jingjing.

747
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,960
Perhaps you can perform before us?

748
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,159
We three can get a clue of
what you're trying to convey.

749
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,520
I can record it.

750
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,599
I'll play some music.

751
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:48,359
Kang Jiawei.

752
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,439
Record it.

753
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,520
I just remember there are

754
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,439
several questions
that I don't understand.

755
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,280
I need your help.

756
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:00,800
Why?

757
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,879
Xu Jingjing is shy before Gao Zhan.

758
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,760
She won't be able to perform.

759
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:05,800
Shy, can you understand?

760
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,919
So she isn't shy

761
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,720
before me?

762
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,359
Don't you get it?

763
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,000
I already sent him the music.

764
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,040
Then...

765
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,159
Let's go.

766
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,520
We have time.

767
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:20,119
Let's leave after I watch it.

768
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:21,320
Go already.

769
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,439
It'll be dark soon.

770
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,159
Let's begin.

771
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,919
You got this, Jingjing.

772
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:39,439
You'll be the champion.

773
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,280
Far from it.

774
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,159
I haven't

775
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,439
finetuned many movements.

776
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,000
That is the least

777
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,639
of my worries.

778
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,599
We have three days left

779
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,399
till the voting deadline.

780
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,399
We have many things

781
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:50,919
to do.

782
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
We need to delegate tasks.

783
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:54,520
Speak.

784
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:56,919
Xu Jingjing will be in charge
of the background.

785
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,800
It has to be cyberpunk

786
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,839
and futuristic.

787
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,919
It's up to you how

788
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,639
you want to present it.

789
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,000
They are not worth much.

790
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,520
No.

791
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:19,839
I don't have hands. Do it yourself.

792
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,839
Kang Jiawei!

793
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,919
If you want a good video,

794
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,280
you need professional equipment.

795
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:27,480
The only thing I can think of

796
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,599
is our school broadcasting team.

797
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,240
Gao, Jingjing.

798
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,320
You're close to them.

799
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,359
I trust you two to get the equipment.

800
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:37,320
No worries.

801
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,240
No problem.

802
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,679
And lastly,

803
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,240
we will be busy

804
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,159
till late night during the shoot.

805
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,359
Do not make Xu Jingjing's mother

806
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,639
suspect anything.

807
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:53,879
You can count on me.

808
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,080
Mrs. Xu!

809
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,839
What a coincidence, Mrs. Xu.

810
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,960
Taking out the trash?

811
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,159
You too?

812
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,760
It's late

813
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,399
and both of them haven't returned.

814
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,520
Their English tutor

815
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,639
must be very diligent.

816
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,960
They have to study until so late.

817
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:15,760
Indeed.

818
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,199
They sure come back

819
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,399
later than before.

820
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,760
Oh, Mrs. Xu.

821
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,639
That day when we were
in the teacher's office...

822
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:26,080
Emotions

823
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,119
got the best of me.

824
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,439
It's okay.

825
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,359
It's for our daughter.

826
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,439
You understand, don't you?

827
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,399
Of course.

828
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,879
Your Jingjing always needs some help.

829
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,760
I'm sure you must be desperate.

830
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:39,159
Exactly.

831
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,080
Fortunately,

832
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,560
she has made some progress.

833
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,520
They have a responsible

834
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,399
English tutor.

835
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:45,919
I'm glad.

836
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:10,240
Voila!

837
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,720
You can open your eyes now.

838
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,000
This is so pretty.

839
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,679
Am I in a dream?

840
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,159
I think we can shoot

841
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,119
today.

842
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,480
Come.

843
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,159
Happy shooting!

844
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,240
Get ready right now.

845
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,040
Xu Jingjing.

846
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,080
Point the spotlight towards here.

847
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:35,439
Yes.

848
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,760
Here.

849
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,399
Gao.

850
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
All right. Ready.

Darling.

885
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,159
Have you seen

886
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,239
my golden microphones?

887
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:14,719
They are gone?

888
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:15,639
I told you.

889
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,159
We must have had a break-in.

890
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:17,599
What?

891
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
My rice cooker and my microwave

892
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,679
are gone too.

893
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,279
Gone?

894
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:20,960
Yes.

895
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,119
Our light strip is gone too.

896
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
The thief has good taste, I must say.

897
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:29,599
You...

898
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Dummy!

899
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,820
(Producer: Team Whale)

900
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,360
Bravo!

901
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,960
Team Whale?

902
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:19,880
Who?

903
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,319
Us.

904
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,679
What about the director, me?

905
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,639
Dude.

906
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,880
If I put your name on it,

907
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,920
everyone will know

908
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,679
that Xu Jingjing

909
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:27,360
is underneath the helmet.

910
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,679
You can put my artist name.

911
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Fatty Kang?

912
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
Then you're the prop artist,
Queen Kong Xu.

913
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,520
I'll kick you.

914
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:34,400
Try it then.

915
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:34,960
I'm not afraid of you.

916
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,840
I work out every day.

917
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,119
Work out?

918
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,480
It's more like physiotherapy.

919
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,239
It must be my order.

920
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,920
Thank you.

921
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,080
Thanks, Xu Jingjing.

922
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:45,639
Thank you for the meal.

923
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:46,199
Truly.

924
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,440
Don't eat that much.

925
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Thank you, everyone.

926
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,799
You have done me

927
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,560
a great service.

928
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,759
Come.

929
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,159
To my great debut

930
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
as a filmmaking prodigy.

931
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:57,880
That's a wrap!

932
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:58,679
Jingjing.

933
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,400
I wish you good grades.

934
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:02,840
Good luck.

935
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:12,679
Thanks, everyone.

936
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,840
Without your help,

937
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,560
I would have given up.

938
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,360
Don't say that.

939
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,400
With the help
of a genius filmmaker like me,

940
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,840
you'll be the champion.

941
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,159
Shut up already.

942
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:24,920
Jingjing.

943
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:25,840
You have

944
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,040
to persevere.

945
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,799
I

946
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,520
will comment and post

947
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,040
on the bullet screen.

948
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,639
And I will keep asking you to upload
more videos!

949
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,199
I'll do my best.

950
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,599
We should make a short film

951
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,520
and send it

952
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,440
to the Cannes Film Festival.

953
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,599
I might be the next

954
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,520
Nolan.

955
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
You?

956
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,639
The next Nolan?

957
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:44,799
Do you know how shaky

958
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,759
your hands were?

959
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm glad you didn't turn

960
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:47,880
the dance video

961
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,920
into a horror video.

962
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,920
Xu Jingjing.

963
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,080
You're one

964
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:51,759
to talk.

965
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,639
Do you know how heavy the camera is?

966
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,520
So you have no strength despite
eating that much?

967
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,880
Let's play a game.

968
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,239
Sure.

969
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,719
I Have But You Don't.

970
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,679
Have you played it?

971
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:07,920
It's simple.

972
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,159
Everyone says something

973
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,040
about him or herself.

974
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,159
Those who don't

975
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,040
have the same experience

976
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,319
will have to eat a slice of lemon.

977
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,840
How do we win then?

978
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,960
Tell us

979
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,119
the most unique experience you have

980
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,480
and make everyone eat the lemon.

981
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:21,440
You won't have to eat
that many lemon slices.

982
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,520
I'll go first.

983
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,920
I have gotten 9 out of 100
for my math exam.

984
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,799
Eat now.

985
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,560
Why are you staring at me?
Eat your lemon.

986
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:39,480
And you're proud of it?

987
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,679
Who next?

988
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,199
I have broken a chair with my weight.

989
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,400
I have starved

990
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,960
for two days straight.

991
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:00,880
I have done it.

992
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:02,319
I have starved for three days.

993
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,199
And you're proud of it?

994
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,679
Next one.

995
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,759
I have a mom who is dating
another classmate's

996
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,279
father.

997
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,360
Come.

998
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:24,960
Xu Jingjing. It's your turn.

999
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,880
I have a crush

1000
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,880
