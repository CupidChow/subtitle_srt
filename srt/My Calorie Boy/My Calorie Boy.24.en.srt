before the ordinal number.

You thought I would never
speak to you again.

this is a great opportunity for you!

149
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:50,041
If you do it,

150

you might become famous!

151
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,041

153
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,041

154
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:00,801

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,001
You think I can get into Fuxing now?

174
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:36,280
Don't you think you're being unfair?

175
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:37,560
Or do you just want

176
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
to put a rest on things

177
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
and get me out of your way?

178
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,040
Get you out of my way?

179
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,040
So you're saying

180
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:45,040
that my going back and forth,

181
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
changing the application
and putting together

182
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,121
the study materials

183
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,121
are all just to dismiss you?

184
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
Who knows what you really think?

185
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:50,841
Xu Jingjing,

186
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:52,400
don't you think that's hurtful?

187
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,280
What makes you think

188
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,241
that I'm not sincere?

189
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,160
If you were sincere,

190
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,800
you wouldn't have applied
for Nashan from the start.

191
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,441
I admit.

192
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,081
I was wrong.

193
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,001
I shouldn't have made the decision

194
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:02,961
for you.

195
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,441
But I know my mistakes.

196
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,321
If you do,

197
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:07,721
then why did you say those things

198
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,441
about me not being able

199
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,601
to get into Fuxing?

200
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,001
But I know I was wrong now.

201
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,081
I don't think that anymore.

202
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,760
I changed it back.

203
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,241
And now you say I'm not sincere.

204
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,001
What am I supposed to do

205
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:16,961
to show you that I'm sincere?

206
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,880
It was wrong of me to want to go
to the same university

207
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,321
as you.

208
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,361
It was wrong of me

209
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,601
not wanting
to see you together with Gao Zhan.

It's not about money.

343
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,241
It's about their future.

344
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Yes.

345
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,321
It is my dream to become a screenwriter.

346
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,920
But

347
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I can't be selfish right now.

348
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,601
They trust me.

349
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,880
So I have
to take responsibility for them.

350
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,560
Isn't that right?

351
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,920
Thank you for understanding.

352
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:00,361
Goodbye.

353
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:33,841
Do you regret it?

354
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,880
It's painful and happy at the same time.

355
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:45,721
Do you remember

356
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:46,520
when I confessed to you

357
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,241
on the rooftop?

358
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,841
Before I decided to do it,

359
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,520
I was scared

360
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:53,640
and had second thoughts too.

361
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:55,880
I was afraid you would reject me.

362
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,441
I was afraid

363
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,640
I wouldn't even have the courage

364
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,640
to stand up there.

365
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,640
But the moment

366
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:07,920
I shouted out those words,

367
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,361
it felt awesome.

368
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,361
I still remember

369
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,361
when you said to everyone
at the gathering

370
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,241
that everyone has the right

371
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
to choose their own future.

372
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:21,680
Miss Chen,

373
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,680
you

374
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,920
have that right too.

375
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,601
But I promised them

376
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:36,441
that I would send them off to college.

377
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
I can't go back on my word.

378
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,601
But what if

379
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,241
they want you
to go after your dream too?

380
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,280
Miss Chen,

381
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
go after your dreams!

382
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:01,601
We love you!

383
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:05,161
Miss Chen,

384
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,040
pursuing your dreams

385
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,641
isn't something only kids can do.

386
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,241
Adults

387
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,481
can chase their dreams too!

388
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,921
If you stay,

389
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,641
you're our best teacher.

390
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,760
If you leave,

391
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,520
you're our best role model.

392
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,080
You teach us the value of our dreams.

393
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,201
And

394
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,401
I don't want them

395
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,800
to ruin your work.

396
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:30,681
We're counting on you!

397
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,681
Miss Chen,

398
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,600
we promise

399
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,040
we'll study hard
even when you're not around.

400
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
We'll work hard!

401
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:37,280
Miss Chen,

402
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,360
you said

403
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,600
a 17-year-old's love

404
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,481
is precious.

405
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,241
A 27-year-old's love

406
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,401
is even more precious!

407
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:44,600
If you leave the school,

408
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,681
you can date Mr. Zhao

409
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,360
without worry!

Miss Chen, go ahead!
Don't worry about us!

Miss Chen,

432
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:37,401
don't worry

433
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,360
about the kids.

434
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,241
If you want to go,

435
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,921
go.

436
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm still here to look after the kids.

437
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,681
I'm a teacher of excellence.

438
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,441
Don't you trust me?

439
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,800
But, sir...

440
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,201
I understand.

441
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,760
But there are many ways for you

442
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:54,520
to be responsible.

443
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:56,520
Going after your dreams

444
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,840
and becoming their role model

445
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:59,520
is one of them too.

446
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:03,840
Sometimes,

447
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,881
we just need a push.

448
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,760
I didn't have the courage

449
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:09,600
to come back to school.

450
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,120
You encouraged me.

451
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,441
Now,

452
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:13,840
it's my turn to give you a push.

453
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:15,560
Also,

454
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,161
I've discussed this with Principal Shen.

455
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,641
You'll be on a leave of absence
without pay.

456
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,120
Whenever you want to come back,

457
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,881
the doors are always open to you!

458
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:22,721
Right?

459
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Yes!

460
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,161
Thank you, everyone.

461
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,600
Let's work hard together!

462
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:38,001
We can do it!

463
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,560
We can do it!

464
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:01,040
Come in.

465
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:04,360
Mr. Zhang,

466
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,721
yesterday's homework.

467
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:06,800
Oh, right.

468
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,001
How is the atmosphere
in the class lately?

469
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,080
Has the class been affected

470
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,360
after Miss Chen left?

471
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,481
You mean in terms of morale?

472
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,721
Has the class's morale been affected?

473
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:18,721
No, no.

474
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,080
It's in a good way.

475
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,320
We thought about it.

476
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,921
If Miss Chen does become famous,

477
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,161
as her students,

478
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,280
we can't embarrass her.

479
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:26,800
So everyone is working really hard.

480
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:29,280
Miss Chen worries about you guys.

481
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:30,800
She texts me every day.

482
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
She can rest assured now.

483
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,721
Today, we will conduct

484
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:36,441
a mock exam

485
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,360
following all the official protocols.

486
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,881
This is to give you guys a chance

487
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:40,721
to get used to it.

488
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:42,840
Don't be nervous.

489
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:43,840
Draw as you normally do.

490
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,481
All right.

491
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,681
Begin.

492
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,641
Wang Jiayao,

493
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,320
is... is my hand

494
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,120
shaking?

495
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:11,080
Relax.

496
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,481
Mr. Qin said it himself.

497
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:13,560
He said you were doing fine.

498
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:14,280
No.

499
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:16,040
I don't want "fine".

500
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:17,760
I want good. Very good.

501
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,600
Good enough

502
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,441
for Fuxing.

503
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,840
It's over. It's all over!

504
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,600
I screwed up my watercolour painting!

505
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,641
How could I have missed

506
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,120
that apple?

507
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:40,241
Wang Jiayao,

508
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,001
have I gone blind?

509
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,441
Indirect loss of vision!

510
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,360
Is that a thing?

511
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,721
Oh, calm down.

512
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,641
That's not the only thing

513
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,641
you'll be graded on.

514
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm so annoyed!

515
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,520
What is bothering you so much?

516
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:55,401
I just...

517
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,080
It's just a bunch of things
that are getting to me.

518
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,721
Well,

519
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,681
I think there's only one thing
that has been bothering you.

520
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,161
Xu Jingjing,

521
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:06,161
when are you

522
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:06,760
going to make up with Kang Jiawei?

523
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,441
I can't hear you!

524
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,040
If you don't make up with him soon,

525
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,280
he is going to annoy me to death.

526
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,681
Why?

527
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Kang Jiawei

528
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,881
asks Xiaobai and me

529
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,280
about you every day.

530
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,401
Our year in Grade 12 is short.

531
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,001
If you keep running away,

532
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,280
you'll actually
miss your chance forever.

533
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:27,681
I do want to talk to him.

534
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
But the longer I drag this out,

535
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,280
the more awkward things become,

536
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:32,840
and the harder it is to talk to him.

537
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,001
It's a vicious cycle. Do you get it?

538
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:34,881
No.

539
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,681
Is it that hard to talk to him first?

540
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:39,320
Then...

541
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,280
Why should I be the one
to make the first move?

542
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,641
Xu Jingjing,

543
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,161
Kang Jiawei was wrong

544
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,560
in that matter.

545
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:47,881
But did you do nothing wrong

546
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,641
at all?

547
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,881
How was your mock exam?

548
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,360
Oh, don't bring it up.

549
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,840
I hate apples.

550
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,681
I never want to see an apple ever again.

551
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:06,961
You've got to be kidding...

552
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,481
See?

553
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,641
I told you.

554
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,681
Gao Zhan will definitely catch it.

555
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:12,840
He has

556
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:13,961
perfect vision now.

557
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:14,641
Ni Dapeng!

558
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,201
Have an apple.

559
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:16,760
What's wrong with you?

560
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,001
What if

561
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,161
you hit his eyes?

562
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:20,800
No way.

563
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:23,360
Why are you guys here?

564
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,641
I heard you just got surgery.

565
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,641
So we came to check on you.

566
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,961
You did?

567
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:27,961
When?

568
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,881
Why didn't you tell me to go with you?

569
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:29,961
Why?

570
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,681
He has me now.

571
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:32,441
Right, Gao Zhan?

572
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:33,760
Two days ago,

573
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,840
my mom went on a business trip.

574
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:36,001
I got it done while she was away.

575
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,280
I paid for my brother's surgery.

576
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,520
Kang Jiawei.

577
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:46,441
Xiaobai, I need to use the bathroom.

578
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,320
Go ahead.

579
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,241
You don't need my permission.

580
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,881
Didn't you say
you wanted to go to the toilet too?

581
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,560
I did?

582
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,040
No?

583
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,481
Actually, I do.

584
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:55,961
Let's go.

585
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,280
It has been so long.

586
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,001
Haven't you guys made up yet?

587
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,681
Come with me to get some drinks.

588
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:26,441
When are you going to make up

589
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,481
with Xu Jingjing?

590
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,921
Oh, right.

591
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:32,001
Why don't we have

592
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,560
another basketball match with Class 6

593
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,600
before the midterms?

594
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,161
I think I've done all I'm supposed to.

595
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:47,401
But you didn't take the initiative

596
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,360
to talk to her.

597
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,320
Even I'm anxious

598
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:53,881
for you guys.

599
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:56,881
I can take the initiative
to talk to her.

600
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,161
But I'm worried that we'll end up

601
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,881
getting

602
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,320
into an argument again.

603
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:04,881
That's nice.

604
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:08,840
What's nice about that?

605
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,320
At least you guys fight.

606
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:15,840
She has never scolded me.

607
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:18,721
Every time she talks to me,

608
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,881
she is always so polite.

609
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,600
Who would like to try

610
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,360
and solve this question?

611
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:43,401
Xu Jingjing.

612
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,600
Not bad.

613
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,001
You managed to solve

614
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:24,800
such a difficult question.

615
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:26,441
Well done!

616
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:38,800
Make sure

617
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,681
to do three sets of practice papers
this weekend.

618
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:41,961
Oh, right.

619
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:44,600
The students who are applying

620
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,681
for Fuxing University

621
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,241
can be exempted.

622
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,681
Fuxing University is a good institution.

623
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,881
I wish all the applicants
the best of luck.

624
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,800
May all of you do well
and get good grades!

625
00:27:07,641 --> 00:27:09,040
(I hope you get good results)

626
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,441
(for your mock exam.)

627
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,161
(I hope you do well)

628
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,241
(in your entrance test tomorrow.)

629
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:15,441
(Don't worry.)

630
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,881
(I will do my best)

631
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,040
(in tomorrow's exam.)

632
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:19,441
(I'll aim to get full marks.)

633
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,280
(After the exam...)

634
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,520
(Exams)

635
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:26,760
(are mentally taxing,)

636
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:29,201
(and we need sustenance,)

637
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,881
(right?)

638
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:31,721
(Do you want
to go out for a meal together?)

639
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,800
What am I doing?

640
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:38,721
No.

641
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,001
What if he turns me down?

642
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:43,481
What if she doesn't reply?

643
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,840
I would lose pride.

644
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,401
The one who makes the first move loses!

645
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
What smells so good?

646
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:58,641
Almonds and peanuts

647
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,201
baked

648
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,881
with hazelnuts and oats.

649
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,800
Nourishing and filling.

650
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,320
Perfect for examinees.

651
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,681
I'm smart enough without this.

652
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,840
I know.

653
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:12,360
Try one.

654
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:15,201
No.

655
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:16,280
Open up.

656
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:17,161
No.

657
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,641
Hurry up.

658
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:22,600
How is it?

659
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,001
Not bad.

660
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:28,641
I need to talk to you about something.

661
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,161
I need to go on a business trip

662
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,161
for a project.

663
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:35,721
How long?

664
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:38,241
It won't be short.

665
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,520
A month?

666
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,681
More than that.

667
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,201
It's fine.

668
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
I'm used to this.

669
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,161
Yes.

670
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,120
But

671
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,800
you'll be taking
the college entrance exam soon.

672
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,161
What are you going
to do about your meals?

673
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,481
I'm not a kid.

674
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,600
I can order takeout and delivery.

675
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,520
That won't do.

676
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,320
Those don't guarantee
nutritionally balanced meals.

677
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:01,481
How about this?

678
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,280
I'll ask your mom to come back.

679
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:08,560
Her?

680
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:09,080
You might as well

681
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,840
lock me up

682
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,401
with 1,000 mosquitoes.

683
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,320
At least I can concentrate better.

684
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:14,800
I just don't want you...

685
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:16,481
Dad, just go.

686
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,921
I can take care of myself.

687
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:20,080
Don't worry.

688
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,881
Where are you going?

689
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:24,401
Going to get something for my classmate.

690
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:25,040
I'll be back in a bit.

691
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,241
Be safe.

692
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:51,920
(Fuxing University)

693
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,161
The exam starts now.

694
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,441
70...

695
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:42,040
Please just give me 70.

696
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,641
That's all I ask.

697
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,441
The results are out.

698
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,401
Take a good look.

699
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,080
It's an important reference

700
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,481
for the official exam.

701
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,881
Some of you
have made significant progress.

702
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:57,921
Some

703
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,360
who usually perform well

704
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,560
have let me down this time.

705
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,681
If you don't pull yourself together,

706
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
you can forget
about taking the exam this year.

707
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:15,760
Wang Jiayao,

708
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:18,520
83!

709
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,441
My marks are in the 80s!

710
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,080
That's good.

711
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:23,320
You improved fast.

712
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,481
What about you?
You must've gotten 90 and above.

713
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,800
Don't let it get to your head.

714
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:33,840
Conceited students

715
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
tend to fall back easily.

716
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,600
Mr. Qin,

717
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,961
what do you think of my progress?

718
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,201
There's still room for improvement.

719
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,881
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

720
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:47,840
Pay attention to your general classes.

721
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,721
Fuxing has high requirements

722
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,441
for general subjects.

723
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,921
What do you want to eat today?

724
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:06,560
My treat.

725
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,280
I'm not hungry.

726
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,040
Do you think this means

727
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:12,921
I should have no problem

728
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
getting into Fuxing now?

729
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,600
You're making quick progress.

730
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,681
What's the matter?

731
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:20,961
Something on your mind?

732
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,961
No. I think I might be coming down
with something.

733
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:28,040
I almost forgot.

734
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,241
Here.

735
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:30,840
Kang Jiawei told me to give this to you.

736
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,600
Kang Jiawei?

737
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:37,161
He came to my house

738
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:38,040
late last night

739
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,600
and told me I had to give this to you.

740
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:42,520
I have something I need to do.

741
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,441
I'll be leaving first.

762
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:11,240
Did it go well?

763
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:13,600
It was easy.

764
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,401
It should be fine.

765
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,080
What about you?

766
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,720
Did you get your results
for the mock exam?

767
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,761
Thanks to your card,

768
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,720
I got a pretty good grade.

769
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,040
That's good.

Here's hoping

772
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,600
both of us get into Fuxing.

more layers?

Xu Jingjing,

787
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:31,841
I know

788
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,560
nothing I say now

789
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,200
will make up

790
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:34,560
for the mistakes I made.

791
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,441
But I sincerely...

792
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,761
I know.

793
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,640
I read the slides.

794
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,321
You did?

795
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,841
I should apologise to you.

796
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,200
I wanted to get into Fuxing too much.

797
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,761
So I was really sensitive.

798
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
I wasn't mad at you
for filling in Nashan.

799
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,520
I was angry at myself.

800
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:59,001
I was worried I wouldn't be able

801
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,921
to get into Fuxing.

802
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,640
You... You don't have
to say that to make me feel better.

803
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,321
I know

804
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:06,001
I was in the wrong.

805
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,520
There were

806
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
many things

807
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,080
I didn't discuss with you...

808
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:11,921
Not at all.

809
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,921
It's my bad.

810
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:14,640
I shouldn't have ignored you

811
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:15,640
for so long.

812
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:19,281
Well, I didn't talk to you
for a long time too.

813
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:21,801
Either way, it's my fault.

814
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,481
I was wrong.

815
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:25,240
I said it was my fault.

816
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,600
It's my fault!

817
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,001
No...

818
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,640
I...

819
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:29,160
You're wrong,

820
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:29,921
and you're wrong.

821
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,961
Both of you are wrong.

822
00:36:31,761 --> 00:36:32,801
(Do not cross the line)
Look at where you're standing.

823
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,560
It's you again.

824
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:38,321
(Road Escort)
You've lost a lot of weight.

825
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,921
I recognise you.

826
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,441
Here, for you two.

827
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:47,441
Happy birthday.

828
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,120
My birthday was so long ago,

829
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:52,881
and you're only wishing me now?

830
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,120
I missed your 18th birthday.

831
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,761
Well, I didn't do much for my birthday.

832
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:06,680
Keep smiling...

833
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:07,921
Smile...

834
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,801
You smiling...

835
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,361
I'll show you...

836
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:15,841
Kang Jiawei, how dare you still smile!

837
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:17,720
You're heartless!

838
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,881
After all I did

839
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,001
for you on your birthday!

840
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,080
Where are you

841
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,801
on my birthday?

842
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,441
I'll show you...

843
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,640
Jingjing, stop.

844
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:24,841
You're going to destroy it.

845
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,200
Calm down.

846
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:26,841
It's fine.

847
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,921
Here, have some cake.

848
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:34,801
Kang Jiawei,

849
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,481
you like cake, don't you?

850
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,240
I'll let you have all the cake you want!

851
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:44,921
I just shared a cake

852
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,401
with Xiaobai and Jiayao.

853
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
It was a simple celebration.

854
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:53,881
Come on.

855
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:55,281
What present do you want
for your birthday?

856
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:56,321
I'll make it up to you.

857
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,720
Oh, it's fine.

858
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,080
Right.

859
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,441
You don't like my presents anyway.

860
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,720
What are you getting me?

861
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,040
Let me ask you something.

862
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,200
Why did you put

863
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:09,761
Gao Zhan

864
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:10,640
and Xu Jingjing's gifts

865
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,961
on your bag but not the dog

866
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,600
I gave you?

867
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,240
Well, it's too big.

868
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:15,361
It's too much

869
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,040
if I hang it on my bag.

870
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:18,080
Well, isn't the bag you gave me

871
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,881
even more dramatic?

872
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,160
But I still use it every day, don't I?

873
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,080
You're jealous.

874
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:23,001
I'm jealous?

875
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,481
Yes, I'm jealous every day.

876
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,160
Every day.

877
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:25,841
I have nothing better to do.

878
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:26,520
I'm just jealous every day.

879
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:26,881
I'm fine.

880
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:27,240
Okay.

881
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:28,560
I'll put it on my bag.

882
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:31,560
And another thing.

883
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,040
Why does Gao Zhan

884
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,881
get a return gift
for the Coming-of-age Ceremony,

885
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:35,801
but I don't?

886
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:36,841
What?

887
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,921
Was my pencil sharpener worth nothing?

888
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,680
Return gift
for the Coming-of-age Ceremony?

889
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,881
You need to wait a bit longer for that.

890
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,200
What? Why?

891
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,140
Come here!

892
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:51,841
Stand here.

893
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,160
What was that?

894
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,240
Don't you know
that you crossed the line?

895
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:54,841
Where do you think you're going?

896
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,120
Obey traffic rules at all times.

897
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,801
Don't your teachers teach you that?

898
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:57,441
Always check
the colour of the traffic lights.

899
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,441
Be good.

900
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,441
That way, when you grow up,

901
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,441
you won't turn out like her.

902
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,001
Got it?

903
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,801
Hold this flag.

904
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:02,720
Hold it.

905
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:04,361
Kang Jiawei!

906
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,481
What did you mean by that, Kang Jiawei?

907
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,120
Get over here!

908
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:15,841
Your Fouette turns improved.

909
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:16,680
Here.

910
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,080
Have some water and take a break.

911
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:19,680
We'll practise your ﻿Passe Releve later.

912
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,040
It's okay, Mom.

913
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm not tired. Let's continue.

914
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:27,200
Okay.

915
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:27,841
Let's go.

916
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:33,120
Relax your shoulders.

917
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,321
Keep your back straight.

918
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:38,560
Hold.

919
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,520
Jingjing,

920
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:47,441
I'm really happy

921
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,481
that you could fall in love
with ballet again.

922
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:51,001
I know

923
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,120
we failed three years ago,

924
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:54,160
and that had a huge impact on you.

925
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,160
You were rebellious and disobedient

926
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,080
because you didn't get
into an affiliated school.

927
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,921
It's okay, Jingjing.

928
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:02,961
We can rectify

929
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,240
our mistakes now.

930
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,761
Everything is back on track again.

931
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,640
Are you all right, Jingjing?

932
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Come on. Let's stop.

933
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:11,761
Let's take a break.

934
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,441
Mom,

935
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:16,080
did you hear anything

936
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,560
from the management companies?

937
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,001
That's okay.

938
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:25,841
Let's go again.

939
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:30,200
Okay.

940
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,881
I'll be here with you.

941
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,200
Use force in your calves.

942
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,841
Straighten your legs.

943
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:43,600
Use force in your calves.

944
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,160
Maintain it.

945
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,040
Tighten your inner thighs.

946
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:57,160
Dad, you're leaving?

947
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,520
Let me introduce you.

948
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,481
Madam Gu.

949
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,720
From now on,

950
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:05,761
she'll cook for you

951
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,600
and clean the house.

952
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:08,961
She is an experienced nanny.

953
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,921
Here, eat the food while it's not.

954
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,801
I just prepared these.

955
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:13,240
Dad,

956
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:14,640
I told you

957
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,001
I could take care of myself.

958
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:20,120
Your dad is just worried about you.

959
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,640
You'll be sitting
for the college entrance exam soon.

960
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,560
Ensuring that you're well fed

961
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,441
and cared for

962
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,560
is my responsibility.

963
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:32,680
Also,

964
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,801
I don't want to come home

965
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,881
to

966
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,120
a rat's nest.

967
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,361
You won't be away for that long.

968
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,281
Is this necessary?

969
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:46,401
Yes.

970
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,080
Hurry up and eat your breakfast.

971
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,600
Don't be late for school.

972
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,120
I'm heading out.

973
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,600
Bye.

974
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,120
Give me a hug.

975
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,281
What?

976
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,560
Why are you making this so mushy?

977
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,801
It's not as if this is goodbye forever.

978
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:16,640
Oh, shut up.

979
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,160
Give me a hug.

980
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:26,961
Stay safe and take care.

981
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:35,680
When did you grow so tall?

982
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:39,321
A long time ago.

983
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,441
I'm off.

984
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,040
Madam Gu,

985
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:45,281
I'll leave the rest to you.

986
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,120
Rest assured.

987
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,520
I'm off.

988
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,720
Your dad

989
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:55,761
really loves you.

990
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,640
Of course. I'm his biological son.

991
00:42:57,961 --> 00:42:58,881
Eat.

992
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:01,200
How does it taste?

993
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:04,361
What's the matter?

994
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,481
Ma'am,

995
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,401
what's inside these?

996
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,001
Mapo Tofu.

997
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:11,361
What's the matter?

998
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,560
Can you not handle spicy food?

999
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:13,961
I can,

1000
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,321
but this is way too spicy.

1001
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,040
Spicy food

1002
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,921
gives me breakouts.

1003
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,761
Oh, I'm sorry.

1004
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,160
I'm from Zigong.

1005
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,801
We tend to go heavy on the spice.

1006
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,160
Next time,

1007
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:27,160
I'll make it less spicy.

1008
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,801
Ma'am, can you not

1009
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:30,720
use any chilli peppers?

1010
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,321
No chilli peppers?

1011
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,600
I can't cook without chilli peppers.

1012
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:37,520
Just use less.

1013
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,080
Less.

1014
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,441
All right.

1015
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,080
Here, try this. This isn't spicy.

1016
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,001
Eat this.
