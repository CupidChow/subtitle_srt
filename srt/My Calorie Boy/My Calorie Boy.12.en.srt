16
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:46,941
I like someone

17
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,781
in our class.

18
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,221
I don't.

19
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,222
These taste fine.

20
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:20,542
Is it sour?

21
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:22,901
No.

22
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,102
Not sour.

23
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,141
Is it sour?

24
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:26,181
No.

25
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:27,342
Not sour.

26
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:28,542
Continue.

27
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:39,382
- Actually, I...
- You...

28
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:41,181
You first.

29
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:44,262
I wanted to say

30
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:45,741
that you should

31
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,102
win first prize

32
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,461
unless the contest was rigged.

33
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:50,581
Actually,

34
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,982
I wanted to thank you just now

35
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,982
but I was embarrassed to say it.

36
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,502
Don't thank me.

37
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:57,982
Were the scenes

38
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:58,942
I created okay?

39
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,301
Thank you for the whale headgear.

40
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,262
I felt

41
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,021
energetic whenever I looked at it.

42
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,181
I felt that what you had earlier

43
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,581
was a bit dull.

44
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,262
Thank you for helping me this time.

45
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:13,942
I didn't expect

46
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,741
Kang Jiawei to be attentive

47
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:16,822
too.

48
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,141
He doesn't

49
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,181
do that

50
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:21,301
for everybody.

51
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,062
Did you notice that?

52
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:22,982
Xu Jingjing.

53
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,342
In our class,

54
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,382
who do you like?

55
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:30,662
I...

56
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,701
haven't eaten yet.

57
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,301
I like...

58
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,342
I like...

59
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,222
I like Xiaobai.

60
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:42,782
Lu Xiaobai.

61
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:43,782
Is it Gao Zhan?

62
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:49,502
Well,

63
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:51,741
it's getting late.

64
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:52,942
Let's go home.

65
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,662
Your mum will look for you soon.

66
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:57,301
Xu Jingjing,

67
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:00,782
I have given up.

68
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:08,701
Really.

69
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,701
Go get him!

70
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,462
There is a better solution

71
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:24,941
for yesterday's question.

72
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:26,941
I used

73
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,381
the best solution.

74
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:29,542
What

75
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,102
is the best solution?

76
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,381
There is none.

77
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:36,542
Yours is the best.

78
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:37,902
I have to buy something.

79
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,102
You go ahead.

80
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:40,301
Okay.

81
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,621
Why are you alone?

82
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,342
Time for class.

83
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:49,941
I'm not in the mood.

84
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:53,702
Take a look

85
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:56,261
at Gao Zhan's candid photos.

86
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,501
I don't want. Boring.

87
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:02,301
What's wrong?

88
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,861
Xu Jingjing gave up.

89
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:07,621
So,

90
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:09,582
you can do it.

91
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:10,861
Wow, this game is great!

92
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:13,222
If I ask

93
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:14,181
the question,

94
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:15,902
do I owe an apology

95
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:17,102
to Xu Jingjing?

96
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,902
No.

97
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,381
Actually,

98
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,582
it's good for her.

99
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:22,821
Think about it.

100
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:24,501
Rather than

101
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:25,621
wait for someone

102
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:26,741
who doesn't like her,

103
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,741
she should give up soon.

104
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:31,381
Moreover,

105
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,982
someone more handsome

106
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:35,902
and better than Gao Zhan

107
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,741
is waiting for her.

108
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:42,462
Where is he?

109
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:43,902
Where?

110
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:44,501
Who...

111
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:45,381
Xu Jingjing,

112
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:46,861
Don't forget.

113
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:48,022
We are in the same team.

114
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:48,902
Alright.

115
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,022
I know.

116
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:57,222
Do you think

117
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,501
we stand a chance?

118
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,902
Definitely yes.

119
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:05,582
Here.

120
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:14,662
Good morning, my Savior.

121
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:16,621
Yesterday, my savior said

122
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:17,702
you hate Chinese pancakes.

123
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:18,861
Today, I brought

124
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:20,061
French pancakes.

125
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,061
Try them.

126
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:22,542
They are...

127
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:24,261
Don't you understand what I mean?

128
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:26,501
What do you mean?

129
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,542
Don't

130
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,861
bring me breakfasts.

131
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:30,222
It's okay, Jiayao.

132
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,582
I'm not doing it for money.

133
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:32,582
I want to do it.

134
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:33,782
What?

135
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:35,501
What's going on?

136
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:36,741
What about Xu Jingjing?

137
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:37,621
I got over her.

138
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:39,861
I discovered

139
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,621
that Xu Jingjing is a distant Goddess,

140
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,022
but Jiayao

141
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,301
is the Angel by my side.

142
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:47,181
Dapeng.

143
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:47,941
Here, Angel.

144
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:49,782
I mean, Jiayao. Go ahead.

145
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,342
I want to tell you

146
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,102
that I

147
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:53,181
eat breakfast at home.

148
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:53,621
So...

149
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:54,662
So, you mean

150
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,222
deliver to your home?

151
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:57,941
No problem. You can count on me.

152
00:06:58,902 --> 00:06:59,542
Dapeng,

153
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:01,582
shake your head.

154
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:05,941
Do you hear

155
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:07,902
the sound of water?

156
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:08,861
Lu Xiaobai,

157
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:09,982
you got water in your brain.

158
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:10,782
Dapeng.

159
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,061
Don't bring me breakfasts.

160
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:13,861
That day,

161
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:15,022
those people went too far.

162
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:15,861
Our classmates

163
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:16,702
would have helped you.

164
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:17,462
I understand.

165
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,061
I'm

166
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,662
returning

167
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:21,861
the favour.

168
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:24,741
how are

169
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:26,462
you and Gao Zhan?

170
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:29,582
Forget it.

171
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,421
Don't worry, Dapeng.

172
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,621
We are on your side.

173
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,222
Xiaobai, you're terrific.

174
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:35,702
Isn't she?

175
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,261
That's what it should be.

176
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,301
During the sports day,

177
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,582
your dad was very helpful.

178
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,061
Why did Gao Zhan belittle him?

179
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:41,662
Yes.

180
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:42,501
Moreover,

181
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:43,542
the candidates

182
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:44,861
at a dating agency aren't always better.

183
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:48,061
What dating agency?

184
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,621
Xiaobai means...

185
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:51,582
You mean Gao Zhan

186
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:52,181
took his mum

187
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:53,222
to a dating agency.

188
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,261
Don't get worked up.

189
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:56,102
He went to enquire.

190
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,181
He overdid it.

191
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,102
Ms. Chen,

192
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,741
please set things straight for me.

193
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:13,941
I...

194
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,222
Tell me.

195
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:17,902
What happened?

196
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:18,902
He started it.

197
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,342
It was self-defence.

198
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,342
Why are you getting

199
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,102
your mum a boyfriend?

200
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:22,662
It is a family matter.

201
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:23,662
Butt out.

202
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:24,342
Gao Zhan,

203
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,022
did you misunderstand

204
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:25,902
my dad?

205
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:26,421
Was he a murderer

206
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:27,381
or arsonist?

207
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:28,142
Who knows?

208
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,022
- You...
- Quiet!

209
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:30,702
Stop it!

210
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,062
Dapeng,

211
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,541
no matter what,

212
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:36,702
it is wrong to hit people.

213
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:37,541
Understand?

214
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:38,661
Ms. Chen,

215
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,062
who hit who?

216
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,741
Can't you see?

217
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:46,302
Is this funny?

218
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,781
Did you fight back?

219
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,501
Both of you will be punished.

220
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:52,741
Ms. Chen, tell me.

221
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:54,222
I'm okay with self-criticism

222
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,182
or calling my parent.

223
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,942
Me too.

224
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:04,261
I can't stand this.

225
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:05,661
Shut up.

226
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,661
Can you stop being so serious?

227
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:10,582
Ms. Chen said

228
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,342
that if we let go
we get 10 minutes more.

229
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,062
No.

230
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:17,302
Not so tight. It's painful.

231
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,021
Why are you staring?

232
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:24,582
Mind your business.

233
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,222
Haven't seen handsome guys before?

234
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,462
I recently drew a Pipi.

235
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,741
Looks good. Nice.

236
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,261
Why did you tell others

237
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:34,982
that we went to the dating agency?

238
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:38,942
I trust you

239
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:40,021
and asked you along

240
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,621
but you told others.

241
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:42,621
Did you treat me

242
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,582
as gossip material?

243
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:44,462
No.

244
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:45,302
I didn't.

245
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,261
Don't explain.

246
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,501
Sorry, Jingjing.

247
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,222
I blurted it out.

248
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,582
Xu Jingjing.

249
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,261
Your supreme combo

250
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,661
with extra sausage and two eggs

251
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:20,462
I specially added

252
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,261
your favourite fermented bean curd.

253
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:23,462
Thanks, Master Kang.

254
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:27,982
Don't feel sad.

255
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,182
I was thinking the whole night

256
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:32,501
that you and Gao Zhan

257
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,541
can still reconcile.

258
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:38,901
Don't you want me to be better?

259
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:39,822
One more time on that side.

260
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,381
My birthday is Sunday.

261
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:43,302
Everyone is invited.

262
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:44,021
Really?

263
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:44,822
Especially you two.

264
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:45,381
You must come.

265
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:46,462
- No problem.
- You must come.

266
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:47,621
Get delicious food.

267
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:48,302
Okay.

268
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:48,901
What do you want?

269
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:49,822
Order now.

270
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:51,342
I'll tell my dad

271
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:52,741
to get what you order.

272
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:53,741
I want crayfish.

273
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:54,781
I want sushi.

274
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:56,822
I love sushi too.

275
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:57,822
No.

276
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:58,381
You like

277
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,781
gimbap.

278
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:01,582
I want a strawberry cake.

279
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,222
Master Kang.

280
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:11,062
Did you hear that?

281
00:11:12,102 --> 00:11:13,342
Yes. Strawberry cake.

282
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,182
Roommate,

283
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:15,102
let's work together

284
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:15,822
and help out.

285
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:16,621
No problem.

286
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,342
I created the opportunity.

287
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:22,702
It is

288
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:23,861
up to you to seize it.

289
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,861
Yes.

290
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,302
Thanks.

291
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,822
Is Sunday really your birthday?

292
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,342
Definitely.

293
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:38,861
What's the gift

294
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:40,342
to repay the favour?

295
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:44,302
It's a secret.

296
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:08,462
Hello.

297
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:09,901
May I know

298
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,261
do you still have the bag

299
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:12,021
over there?

300
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:12,822
Sorry.

301
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,942
It's a limited edition.

302
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:14,661
We sold

303
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:15,861
the last one.

304
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:18,901
How about other things?

305
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,342
Okay.

306

307

Faster. Faster

308
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,062
No way.

309
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,261
Do I have to win

310
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,861
my own birthday gift?

311
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:05,541
The bag was sold out.

312
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,102
Go quickly.

313
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:06,901
Forget it.

314
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:07,822
Our friendship

315
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,222
is more than this.

316
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:09,942
Forget it.

317
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:10,822
Let's eat.

318
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:11,462
No.

319
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:12,422
If we are late,

320
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:13,621
others will win it.

321
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,781
Okay. Okay.

The best couple challenge.

324
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:27,501
We are senior year students.

325
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:28,661
Isn't this inappropriate?

326
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:30,702
I'm not embarrassed.

327
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:31,901
No one will know.

328
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,861
Heaven knows, you know, and I know.

329
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:34,741
No one else

330
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:35,501
will know.

339
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,381
He knows us.

340
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,102
It's easier to win the prize.

341
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,822
I'll explain it to him at home.

342
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:58,342
Good. Good. Good.

343
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:00,781
The air is filled

344
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:01,942

353
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:21,062
my question is

354
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,222
are you sure about taking part

355
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,822
in the Best Couple Contest?

356
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:27,261
Yes.

357
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,861
That was a quick answer.

358
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:31,781
I'll explain when I go home.

359
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:33,381
Okay.

360
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:34,261
Let me

361
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,982
ask the male contestant.

362
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:38,901
How do you feel

363
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,261
now?

364
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,302
I would rather die.

365
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:48,741
If so,

366
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:49,501
leave quickly.

367
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:50,021
Okay.

368
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,062
Wait.

369
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:54,422
What he meant was

370
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,462
that he is confident of winning.

371
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:57,422
He is too nervous.

372
00:14:58,182 --> 00:14:59,062
Xu Jingjing.

373
00:14:59,182 --> 00:14:59,661
Mr. Xu,

374
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,021
what's going on?

375
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,982
Wait till you get home!

376
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,741
Young people fear nothing.

377
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:08,861
Good answer.

378
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:10,702
Let's start.

379
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:11,422
Today,

380
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:12,861
we will test

381
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,462
your compatibility

382
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:15,541
and choose

383
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:17,501
the best couple in the show today.

384
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:18,541
Next,

385
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,621
give

386
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:22,141
the warmest applause

387
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:23,541
to encourage the contestants.

388
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,062
Alright?

389
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,901
Yes.

390
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,942
Wow!

391
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:45,342
Monkey.

392
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,541
Gorilla.

393
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,222
King Kong. King Kong.

394
00:15:58,302 --> 00:15:58,982
Tractor.

395
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:03,342
Cobra.

396
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:06,062
It's 007!

397
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,261
Michael Jackson.

398
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:16,741
Spider-Man.

399
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:22,741
Quick.

400
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:24,541
Movie. Movie.

401
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:25,462
Then...

402
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:27,861
European.

403
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:30,901
Titanic.

404
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,901
Great!

405
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:47,222
The contest is very intense.

406
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,942
The following games

407
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,462
will be even more exciting.

408
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,982
The contestants will

409
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,102
find their partners through scent.

410
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,102
Not this.

411
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:06,101
You didn't bathe.

412
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,781
I'll give you one more chance.

413
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,182
Are you sure?

414
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:32,261
Alright.

415
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,182
Please take off your blindfold.

416
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,222
Alright. Alright.

417
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:41,902
Okay.

418
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:43,741
I declare that this pair

419
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:45,581
will go into the finals.

420
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,902
Congratulations to the three couples.

421
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:57,222
No. Two.

422
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:00,182
That's wrong.

423
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:00,902
Mr. Xu,

424
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,261
do you want to quit?

425
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:05,982
Okay.

426
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:08,702
Congratulations to the three pairs

427
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,662
for getting into the finals.

428
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:15,462
Great.

429
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:16,501
Okay.

430
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:18,541
The finals.

431
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:22,061
For the finals, the game is...

432
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,222
The game is...

433
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:27,902
What?

434
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,101
Tell us. Tell us.

435
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,382
What is it?

436
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:31,982
Say it.

437
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:33,341
The Ultimate Kiss!

438
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:43,142
Well,

439
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:45,662
I used mayonnaise for

440
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:46,382
the scent.

441
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:47,741
Was I witty?

442
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:49,942
Okay.

443
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:53,942
Don't be depressed.

444
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,462
It's just a school bag.

445
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,142
I am happy with whatever you give me.

446
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,781
I can't accept this.

447
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,422
We're just one level away.

448
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:08,821
What's so funny?

449
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:11,702
Tell me.

450
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:13,942
If your dad wasn't there,

451
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:15,541
will you kiss me?

452
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,982
In your dream. That's my first kiss.

453
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:19,261
Anyone but you.

454
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:20,501
I thought so too.

455
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:22,982
First Kiss.

456
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:25,301
Anyone but you.

457
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,862
Thanks for your kindness.

458
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:27,581
What do you mean?

459
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:28,382
I don't deserve you?

460
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,301
I didn't say that.

461
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:30,101
You did.

462
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:31,781
Kang Jiawei!

463
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:45,142
Tell me.

464
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:46,061
What happened?

465
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:47,781
What's going on?

466
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,182
What do you mean?

467
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,821
Don't pretend

468
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:55,222
and play dumb.

469
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,341
Are you talking about the contest?

470
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,261
I wanted to give Kang Jiawei

471
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,301
a birthday present

472
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,142
but the schoolbag was sold out

473
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:07,662
in the store.

474
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:08,982
By chance, I noticed

475
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:10,741
that the prize was the bag.

476
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:11,662
So, I took part.

477
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:15,061
Didn't I say

478
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,821
that they are not dating?

479
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,021
You don't believe me.

480
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,182
Your dad doesn't trust you at all.

481
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:21,741
Anything else?

482
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:23,061
If not, I'll go.

483
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,021
Go. Go.

484
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:26,781
Okay!

485
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,462
Good point.

486
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,462
I almost believed you.

487
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:32,341
However,

488
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,781
I am a careful

489
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,702
and observant father.

490
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,142
Confess or I'll punish you.

491
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:39,021
How long have

492
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:40,261
you been together?

493
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,702
Dad, stop teasing me.

494
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:43,422
We are not

495
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:44,222
an item.

496
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:45,982
He is my

497
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:50,702
bestie.

498
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,942
A male bestie. Do you understand?

499
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:54,862
Male bestie?

500
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:55,862
Hey.

501
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:57,501
Is there such a thing?

502
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:58,382
So?

503
00:20:58,581 --> 00:20:59,501
You don't believe me.

504
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,622
I did it for the bag.

505
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:02,341
Look.

506
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:03,662
Let me see.

507
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:07,222
This bag is not strong.

508
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:07,902
Girl,

509
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:09,581
you don't have an eye for things.

510
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,541
It's not ready yet. Wait and see.

511
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,982
Male bestie.

512
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,142
So what?

513
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,702
It's normal.

514
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:25,581
Is it so?

515
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:26,581
Yes.

516
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:28,622
Do you have one?

517
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:33,261
Is it next door's Xu?

518
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:35,741
Are you crazy?

519
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,061
Am I right?

520
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:40,462
Do you feel guilty?

521
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:42,021
Wang Jiaren, let me tell you,

522
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:43,541
I will go to Liu Wan.

523
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:44,942
Male bestie!

524
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,581
Xu Bing, what did you just say?

525
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:49,702
Can you repeat that?

526
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:52,702
I said that I will wash the dishes.

527
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,021
What's wrong with your ears?

528
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:00,541
Go to Liu Wan.

529
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,261
You're only fit to wash dishes.

530
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,982
Have you made up your mind?

531
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:06,862
When is the wedding?

532
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:07,178
(Zhang Wei)

533
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:07,741
Soon.

534
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,061
in half a month.

535
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,142
Yes.

536
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:11,301
David is a nice guy.

537
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,862
He is supportive of your work.

538
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:13,781
Am I right?

539
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,182
The proposal for the library design

540
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:17,341
that you sent me

541
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,422
feels great.

542
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:19,541
Great progress.

543
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:20,581
Thanks.

544
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,261
I wish you

545
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:23,222
a happy wedding.

546
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:25,862
In fact, I think you should

547
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:27,222
get married a few years ago.

548
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:28,581
I have to

549
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:30,021
get his daughter's

550
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:30,902
blessings first.

551
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:32,182
You stayed abroad

552
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:33,541
for so many years.

553
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:34,581
You shouldn't

554
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:35,541
think like our people.

555
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,142
Foreign children

556
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:38,942
don't care at all.

557
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:40,382
Really.

558
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:42,902
The two little girls are so cute.

559
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:43,741
Every day, they begged me

560
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:45,422
to make fried spring rolls

561
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,222
and dumplings.

562
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:48,382
They're close to me.

563
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,222
From what you said,

564
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:50,982
Zhang Wei,

565
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:52,982
I'm happy for you.

566
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,182
Oh,

567
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:55,862
have you prepared

568
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,061
our son's birthday party?

569
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,341
Yes.

570
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,142
A tableful.

571
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,422
The food is getting burned.

572
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:04,702
Talk later.

573
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:05,564
(End Chat)

574
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:25,382
Is she marrying

575
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:26,101
her boyfriend?

576
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:30,982
Forget I asked.

577
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:39,501
Legally, do I

578
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:40,581
have two more sisters?

579
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:44,821
Never mind.

580
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:45,781
Not my business.

581
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:50,182
Can you let me talk?

582
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:52,862
Son,

583
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,702
it's good for your mum.

584
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,021
I know.

585
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:05,982
No comments.

586
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:09,142
She left for so many years.

587
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,862
Let's drop the topic.

588
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:15,942
I have a meeting next morning.

589
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,862
I will try to rush home.

590
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:19,942
Okay.

591
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:22,382
Will you be super happy

592
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,422
if I come home late

593
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:24,662
so that you

594
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:25,662
and your classmates

595
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,902
can do as you pleased?

596
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,501
You read my mind.

597
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,541
Listen.

598
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:32,581
The dishes

599
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:33,781
you want are ready.

600
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,422
There are more in the fridge

601
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,261
but tell your classmates

602
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:38,061
they are pre-cooked.

603
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,541
They won't taste as good.

604
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:40,741
They don't reflect

605
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:42,142
my standard.

606
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,382
Thanks, dad.

607
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,622
I am happy that you want

608
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:47,982
a birthday party.

609
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:51,462
Is the strawberry cake

610
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:52,942
ready?

611
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:56,622
Of course.

612
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:01,622
Okay.

613
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:02,462
Do you know

614
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:03,541
what this is for?

615
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,702
How could you cut it?

616
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:38,422
Now I know Mr. Kang

617
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:39,142
can cook.

618
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:40,702
These are convenient to cook.

619
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:43,581
My dad can cook more complicated dishes.

620
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,021
We have many people.

621
00:25:46,182 --> 00:25:47,021
I'll open the door.

622
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:52,982
Welcome.

623
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:53,902
Where is Gao Zhan?

624
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:54,541
Inside.

625
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:03,821
Your birthday

626
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:05,222
is first rate.

627
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,142
I didn't notice this last time.

628
00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:09,982
Your home decoration is beautiful.

629
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:11,182
This furniture accessory

630
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:12,662
is amazing.

631
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:14,101
Mr. Kang Minzhi's

632
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:15,222
masterpieces.

633
00:26:15,462 --> 00:26:16,622
No.

634
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:18,581
This is a second-hand unit.

635
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:19,301
He dislikes

636
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,382
the old renovation.

637
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,581
It's too common.

638
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:22,741
He wants to redo it.

639
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:27,341
That's true.

640
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:28,982
Many people

641
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:29,982
have this decoration.

642
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:30,902
It's not unique.

643
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:31,982
Mr. Kang Minzhi is right.

644
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:32,902
Xu Jingjing.

645
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:34,982
Get down to business.

646
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:37,541
Hey,

647
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:38,662
my game console

648
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:39,341
is upstairs.

649
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:41,142
I'll bring it down.

650
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:44,301
You can do it.

651
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:50,581
Gao Zhan, let me help you.

652
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:51,902
I'm okay.

653
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:57,382
Actually,

654
00:26:58,142 --> 00:26:58,781
I want to say

655
00:26:58,942 --> 00:26:59,942
that you misunderstood.

656
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:03,501
Really.

657
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:04,182
I didn't gossip

658
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:05,702
about your private matter.

659
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,061
Kang Jiawei

660
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:10,902
has conveyed that.

661
00:27:12,902 --> 00:27:14,341
Don't you have something

662
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:15,741
to say to me?

663
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:24,142
The cake will be here.

664
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:25,142
I'll get it.

665
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:40,702
Show me

666
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:41,622
your ultimate skill.

667
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:42,341
Quick, quick.

668
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:43,781
See my knife?

669
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:46,021
See it?

670
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,061
What game is this?

671
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:47,942
You only screamed.

672
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:49,581
Can you play?

673
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:51,821
You chose the wrong person.

674
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:52,462
What?

675
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:53,581
I am full.

676
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:54,462
Kang Jiawei.

677
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:55,382
Happy Birthday.

678
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,942
Welcome, welcome, come in.

679
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:58,301
Here.

680
00:27:58,581 --> 00:27:59,982
This is your birthday present.

681
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:01,662
Open it and see if you like it.

682
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:02,821
It's so big.

683
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:04,021
Thank you.

684
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:07,942
Do you like it?

685
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:13,142
Yes.

686
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:14,182
Good.

687
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:15,422
I fought hard

688
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:16,301
to get it.

689
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:19,182
Okay, please sit down. Sit down first.

690
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:26,781
Xu Jingjing.

691
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,101
Where are you going?

692
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:34,341
Something happened at home.

693
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:35,301
I have to go.

694
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:35,902
I'll be back.

695
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:37,662
Isn't this my present?

696
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:39,422
I got the wrong one.

697
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:40,581
I'll change it.

698
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:42,462
Okay.

699
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:44,021
Hurry back.

700
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,021
Kang Jiawei!

701
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:58,622
Is it funny?

702
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:01,501
You drew this.

703
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:03,222
Is it funny?

704
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:04,501
Jingjing gave you

705
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:05,182
a genuine one.

706
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,541
This is pirated.

707
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,781
Says who?

708
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,222
This is a worldwide limited edition

709
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,581
customised and handmade

710
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:15,862
only copy.

711
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,501
I like it.

712
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:29,021
See? I like it so much.

713
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:30,702
Give it to me.

714
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:31,741
Please.

715
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:35,781
Please.

716
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,862
Okay?

717
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:37,821
Okay.

718
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,702
If you like it so much,

719
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,462
I'll part with it reluctantly.

720
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,142
Okay, let's go.

721
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:47,382
Master Kang,

722
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:49,021
your dad can cook.

723
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:50,021
Restaurant style.

724
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:50,702
Isn't it?

725
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:52,382
Gao Zhan, stop that

726
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:53,101
and come here.

727
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:53,702
Yes.

728
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:54,741
Coming.

729
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:56,501
Jingjing.

730
00:29:56,702 --> 00:29:57,142
Thank you.

731
00:29:57,382 --> 00:29:58,301
Pass me the tissue.

732
00:29:58,741 --> 00:29:59,382
There is some here.

733
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:00,622
Here.

734
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:01,781
Thank you. Thank you.

735
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,222
Xiong Shuai.

736
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,422
Sit here.

737
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:12,702
We are so happy today.

738
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,301
Let me say something.

739
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,902
Today's dishes

740
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,702
are delicious.

741
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:24,501
Great.

742
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,261
Great.

743
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:27,382
Sit down, sit down.

744
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:30,101
Let me say something.

745
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:38,902
Are you in pain?

746
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:39,622
Where?

747
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:40,821
I'm not in form today.

748
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:42,422
Go ahead.

749
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:43,862
Let me say something.

750
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:45,902
Today,

751
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,021
we gather

752
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:48,182
although we are busy.

753
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:49,142
This isn't easy.

754
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:50,622
We thank Kang Jiawei

755
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:52,182
for giving us this opportunity.

756
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,061
Kang Jiawei.

757
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:54,581
Happy birthday!

758
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:55,101
Thank you.

759
00:30:55,702 --> 00:30:56,501
Happy birthday.

760
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:57,702
Happy birthday.

761
00:30:57,902 --> 00:30:59,222
I wish Master Kang good looks.

762
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:01,821
Kang Jiawei,

763
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:03,902
you were fat because heaven

764
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,101
is jealous of your perfect

765
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:05,862
slim look.

766
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,581
Now that you're slim,

767
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:08,821
may you eat

768
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:09,862
but stay slim.

769
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,581
Listen to how good this is.

770
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:12,501
My turn.

771
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,541
I wish Master Kang

772
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:17,741
auspiciousness,

773
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,142
eternal youth,

774
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,301
boundless happiness,

775
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,462
and prosperity and health.

776
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,741
From your grandson.

777
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:26,261
You're welcome.

778
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:27,581
What rubbish

779
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:28,101
did you give me?

780
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:29,382
Your problem.

781
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:30,382
You...

782
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:32,541
I hope

783
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:33,422
after we graduate,

784
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,101
we can often

785
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:36,101
get together.

786
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:40,021
After this semester,

787
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:42,021
we'll go to different classes.

788
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:43,261
Yes.

789
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:45,702
Do we still have a chance

790
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,182
to gather like this?

791
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:48,862
Don't be so sad.

792
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:49,902
Of course, we do.

793
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:50,741
Why not?

794
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:53,101
How about we make a pact

795
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:54,581
to dine together here on this day

796
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:55,462
every year?

797
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:56,341
My treat.

798
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:57,142
I agree.

799
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,222
- Yes.
- Yes.

800
00:31:58,222 --> 00:31:58,781
Here.

801
00:31:58,821 --> 00:32:00,462
I wish Class 3 will be together forever.

802
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:01,462
Yes! Cheers!

803
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,662
Cheers!

804
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,021
Get the cake.

805
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:08,142
I'll get it.

806
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:10,261
Make room.

807
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:14,422
Kang Jiawei.

808
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,462
♪Happy birthday to you♪

809
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:56,942
Kang Jiawei!

810
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:58,501
He...

811
00:32:59,261 --> 00:32:59,902
What's wrong with him?

812
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,982
It's just a cake.

813
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:03,541
What's the fuss?

814
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:09,261
Hello, Xiaobai.

815
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,741
Have you found him?

816
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,182
I haven't.

817
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:13,341
His phone is off.

818
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,261
Okay.

819
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:16,341
Search some more.

820
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:19,222
Talk later.

821
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:25,541
Kang Jiawei.

822
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:27,501
Kang Jiawei, what are you doing?

823
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:31,182
What's wrong?

824
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:35,622
No.

825
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:36,942
Stop eating.

826
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:37,982
Stop it, Kang Jiawei.

827
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,222
Leave me alone.

828
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,702
You'll get sick.

829
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,182
It's my fault.

830
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,182
Sorry.

831
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:44,261
It's not you.

832
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:58,741
After I turned nine,

833
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:01,422
I never had a birthday.

834
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,741
(On my ninth birthday,)

835
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:06,301
(my parents divorced.)

836
00:34:07,182 --> 00:34:07,702
Kang Jiawei,

837
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:09,221
Come play games at my house.

838
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:09,942
No.

839
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:10,822
I want to

840
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:12,101
celebrate with my parents.

841
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,101
Okay. Bye.

842
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:13,581
Goodbye.

843
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:14,141
Goodbye.

844
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:15,661
Let's get a divorce.

845
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:17,742
Can we postpone this?

846
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:19,782
Postpone?

847
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:21,541
For how long?

848
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:23,021
One day?

849
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:24,701
Two days?

850
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:28,862
Today is our son's birthday.

851
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:30,462
Must you discuss this now?

852
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:31,382
Don't worry.

853
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:33,621
Jiawei is my son too.

854
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:35,061
I will

855
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:36,501
celebrate with him.

856
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:39,462
I have already received

857
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:40,382
the offer from school.

858
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:42,501
I'm definitely leaving.

859
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,621
You can study

860
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:46,742
abroad

861
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:47,302
but why

862
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,422
must we divorce?

863
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:49,701
We can stay married

864
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:50,621
and take Jiawei

865
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:51,661
to the United States.

866
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:53,822
Can we be realistic?

867
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:54,701
I still have

868
00:34:54,902 --> 00:34:56,141
many projects in progress.

869
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:57,541
I can't just walk away.

870
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:58,581
So,

871
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:01,541
you stay in the country
and prosper

872
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,141
but I have no future here.

873
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:06,422
What was

874
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,822
our plan?

875
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:09,862
We won't have kids for

876
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:10,782
five years.

877
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,581
We'll build

878
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:13,902
our careers.

879
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:15,541
When I was in college,

880
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,541
my grades are as good as yours.

881
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:18,661
I also want to be

882
00:35:18,862 --> 00:35:20,742
the best interior designer
in our country.

883
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,141
What do I have now?

884
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:27,942
I know.

885
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:28,661
I understand.

886
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:29,742
Do you?

887
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:31,701
You don't know anything at all.

888
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:33,181
You don't know
what the last three years

889
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,061
meant.

890
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:37,262
When I return

891
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,902
to work,

892
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:40,382
what's left for me

893
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,422
was being a designer assistant

894
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:45,782
and stand-in designer.

895
00:35:51,302 --> 00:35:52,382
Can you wait some more?

896
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,101
Give me two more years.

897
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:55,262
We will open

898
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:56,141
a new studio

899
00:35:56,302 --> 00:35:56,661
with you in charge.

900
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,021
Kang Minzhi!

901
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:02,181
You still don't understand.

902
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:03,942
My Life

903
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:05,942
has been disrupted by you all.

904
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:09,302
If I stay,

905
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:12,462
you all will hold me hostage.

906
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:28,581
After she left,

907
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:30,342
there were only my dad and me at home.

908
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:33,782
Maybe my dad

909
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:34,661
felt he owed me.

910
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:37,021
Even if he was busy,

911
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,742
he would cook delicious food for me.

912
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:40,302
Steamed pork ribs,

913
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:42,501
braised pork with preserved vegetables,

914
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,221
fried steak,
braised pork in sauce,

915
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:46,061
and hot chocolate.

916
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:50,181
The

917
00:36:50,262 --> 00:36:50,902
food comforted me

918
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:52,462
during the hardest days.

919
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,221
I ate more and more.

920
00:36:56,862 --> 00:36:58,021
I didn't feel full

921
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:00,742
or hungry.

922
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,462
One day,

923
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:09,302
I discovered

924
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:11,342
mayonnaise.

925
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:14,581
When I was anxious,

926
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:15,422
I ate mayonnaise

927
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:16,822
to calm down.

928
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:20,782
At the worst moment,

929
00:37:23,262 --> 00:37:24,621
I always carried a bottle

930
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,822
like a placebo.

931
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:30,061
Sorry.

932
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:32,501
Actually,

933
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:34,302
you don't have to

934
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:35,262
host the party for me.

935
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:38,061
It's actually not entirely for you.

936
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:45,982
My mum is getting married.

937
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,581
The man has two daughters.

938
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,942
My mum said she would cook

939
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,221
delicious food for them.

940
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:10,382
She can get along

941
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,822
with children

942
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:19,262
who are unrelated by blood

943
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,382
but I was an accident.

944
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:26,581
I am the sinner

945
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,742
who ruined her life.

946
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:29,541
No, Kang Jiawei.

947
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,342
You're wrong.

948
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,141
You're wrong.

949
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:33,302
I am.

950
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,382
I am unnecessary.

951
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:35,302
I shouldn't be born.

952
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:37,061
Say that again and I'll be mad.

953
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:39,221
You are outstanding.

954
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:41,021
You are the pride of your dad.

955
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,061
Look how great you are now.

956
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:43,942
If your mum knows,

957
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:45,302
she will regret it.

958
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:46,382
So,

959
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,342
make yourself better.

960
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,462
Show her

961
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:50,621
that without her,

962
00:38:50,782 --> 00:38:52,141
you two can live happily.

963
00:38:57,262 --> 00:38:57,982
Wei.

964
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:02,581
Mr. Kang.

965
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,221
Come here.

966
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:19,982
Dad.

967
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:22,422
I'm fine.

968
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,342
I know you're fine.

969
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:26,342
Do you want the gift?

970
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:31,262
Thanks, dad.

971
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:33,501
Come.

972
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:40,101
Alright.

973
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:45,101
Go.

974
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:20,221
Are you okay?

975
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,302
Sorry.

976
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:24,862
I made everyone worry.

977
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:26,621
You're okay.

978
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:29,342
Here.

979
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:31,661
It's nothing fancy.

980
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,581
Happy birthday to you.

981
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:46,262
Thank you.

(Yuming Senior High School)

983
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,080
(Grade 11 Class 3)

984
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:11,942
Is that it?

985
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:13,541
I feel so proud.

986
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,862
You don't carry the schoolbag
from the Goddess.

987
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,302
Yours is dirt resistant.

988
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:19,782
I retract the gift.

989
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:20,701
Why?

990
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:21,342
I retract it.

991
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,621
You already gave it to me.

992
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:23,701
Classmates,

993
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:28,822
by now, you must have heard

994
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,141

996
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:32,342
Are we learning to farm?

997
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:33,862
Yes.

998
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:36,462
Learn to farm.

999
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:37,701
Learn to farm.

1000
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:39,221
