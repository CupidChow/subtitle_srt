we shouldn't bring up this subject.

in the illusion.

One fried pancake, as usual.

Two eggs and two hams, please.

Maybe you can order something else?

127
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,241
Then

128
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,921
a bun will do.

Are you sure you can finish all of them?

We ran into each other here

(Fried Pancake, Traditionally Made)
Fried pancakes

179
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:56,520
(Fried Pancake, Traditionally Made)
have a lifespan too.

180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,241
Ten minutes after it's done

181
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,081
is when

182
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,800
it's in its prime.

183
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,040
It's crispy

184
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,481
but fluffy.

185
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,321
Coupled with the sweet bean sauce
and ham slices?

186
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:07,481
It's a match made in heaven.

187
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,081
Enough.

188
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,321
Which school are you in?

189
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,400
I haven't seen you before.

190
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,160
Yuming Senior High School

191
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,120
has more than 1,400 pupils.

192
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,760
You have met every student?

193
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,880
You memorized all their faces?

194
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,400
You...

195
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,481
Stop it already.

196
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:42,280
No need to hide your face.

197
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,481
The pancake

198
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
isn't big enough to cover your face
anyway.

199
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,841
He's gone already.

200
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,561
There should be some extra uniforms

201
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,321
in the school's supply room.

202
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,201
Get changed

203
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:54,961
there.

204
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh, no.

205
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,040
Oh, no.

206
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,800
You're a jinx.

207
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,361
Walk, please.

208
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,400
Who did you call a jinx?

209
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm a jinx.

210
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,400
Are you happy now?

211
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,460
(Supply Room)

212
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,880
Careful.

213
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,601
Look.

214
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,160
A board stuck to them.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,400
Come in.

216
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,940
(Fried Pancake, Traditionally Made)

217
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,241
What is that look?

218
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Why haven't you come in?

219
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:32,841
Sir.

220
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:35,961
We're stuck.

221
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,160
Impressive.

222
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,400
I have been teaching
for more than three decades

223
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,400
and this is my first time seeing

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
someone get stuck by the doorway.

225
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,361
Sir.

226
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,721
We would like to borrow
a new pair of pants.

227
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,400
We have your size.

228
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:57,160
What

229
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,081
is your usual size?

230
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,920
XXXX...

231
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,400
Why are you stuttering?

232
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:05,920
XXXXL!

233
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,241
That's a special size.

234
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:10,481
You usually need to pre-order that size.

235
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,241
We don't have it here at the moment.

236
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:14,160
Come in.

237
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:14,920
Hi, mister.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,321
Mister.

239
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm here to collect
the cheerleading uniforms.

240
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,040
Okay.

241
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:20,160
Hang on.

242
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Sir.

243
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,760
Can you check if you have

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,880
a pair of XXXXL size pants?

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,081
I don't have them.

246
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,520
Xu Jingjing?

247
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,120
You're...

248
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,160
Ask him.

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
We're here to borrow school pants.

250
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,961
They don't have XXXXL size here.

251
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,721
I can't fit into XXXL size.

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,601
Maybe I can ask the basketball team

253
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,321
for you?

254
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,201
They should have

255
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
a pair of large-size shorts.

256
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:49,241
Oh...

257
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,120
Thank you so much.

258
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,201
It fits me quite well.

259
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,081
Thank you.

260
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:56,640
Anytime.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,961
The cheerleading team needs me.

262
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,601
I have to go now.

263
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,400
Excuse me.

264
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:01,441
What is your name?

265
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:01,961
Xu Jingjing.

266
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:07,361
Xu Jingjing.

267
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,361
Her name is Xu Jingjing

268
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:10,280
and you're Xu Jingjing too.

269
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:10,961
Is she your...

270
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,920
Do not talk to me.

271
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:13,000
From now on,

272
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
we don't know each other.

273
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,500
(Grade 11 Class 3)

274
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,681
One fried pancake, please.

275
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:22,481
Shut it.

276
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,040
You're jeopardizing our friendship.

277
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:26,561
That was a hilarious morning.

278
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,441
Which class is that guy from?

279
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,841
I don't care.

280
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:31,160
I just don't want

281
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,520
to see him again.

282
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,841
Do you know

283
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:35,000
how awkward I felt?

284
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:36,120
I ran into Xu Jingjing

285
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,601
when I was out there.

286
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,441
I can never catch a break.

287
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,000
Think positively.

288
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,721
Gao Zhan and you are classmates
for a year

289
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,841
and you finally left him

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,361
a memorable impression.

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,520
Go to him

292
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,081
and thank him for his suggestion.

293
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:56,760
Exactly.

294
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
Didn't you always complain

295
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,561
that you're too far

296
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,561
and you didn't have a chance
to talk to him?

297
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,160
From the tenth Grade until now,

298
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,201
he talked to you

299
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,120
ten times.

300
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,601
Eight of which were

301
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,721
"Did you

302
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,561
forget your homework again?"

303
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,841
And the other two times were

304
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:10,120
"Excuse me.

305
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:11,201
Thank you."

306
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,081
Stop it already you two.

307
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,400
I will prove

308
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,361
you wrong now.

309
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:16,800
Sure.

310
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,681
I...

311
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,721
I...

312
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Are you talking to me?

313
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:46,280
Thank you

314
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,321
for letting me know the supply room
has school pants.

315
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,561
You got changed?

316
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,441
I...

317
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,481
I...

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,561
The class will begin soon.

319
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:05,160
14 lines in total then.

320
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:05,841
Bugger off.

321
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,700
(Freedom and Fairness,
Intelligent and Innovative)

322
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,241
I have two announcements
before the class.

323
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,321
First thing first.

324
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:16,201
From now on,

325
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:16,920
a new transfer student

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,800
will join us.

327
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,520
Come in.

328
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,081
Introduce yourself.

329
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,681
That's him.

330
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,040
Hi, I'm Kang Jiawei.

331
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,321
I'm very happy to be here
at Yuming Senior High School.

332
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,760
I hope we can be

333
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,441
good friends.

334
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,241
A transfer when a good portion
of the semester is over?

335
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,241
I know, right?

336
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:44,880
You have problems?

337
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,601
Let's welcome Kang Jiawei.

338
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
(Humble and Adaptive,
Virtues and Duty)

339
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,920
And now, the second matter.

340
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,040
Where do I sit, miss?

341
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:01,841
Hold on.

342
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,601
Stop laughing.

343
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,760
Line up outside.

344
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,721
I will rearrange your seats.

345
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:14,721
Where do you want to sit this time?

346
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,880
I want to sit next to the window,
in the row before the last one.

347
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:17,880
It's quieter.

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,040
I should be in the last row.

349
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:22,880
We won't take each other seats.

350
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:34,520
They will definitely sit
next to each other again.

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,361
Xu Jingjing.

352
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,081
Let me keep you company.

353
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:38,681
Save me the seat.

354
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:41,321
But I want to sit next to Wei Xue.

355
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,321
Right, Wei Xue?

356
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,601
Yes. She wants to sit next to me.

357
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:46,400
Okay.

358
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm cool.

359
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,441
Gao Zhan.

360
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Gao Zhan is still

361
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,081
in the same spot.

362
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,481
Because he's a loyal man.

363
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:04,800
You're hopelessly smitten.

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,601
Xu Jingjing.

365
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,601
Come.

366
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Who will she sit with?

367
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,520
She's so close to Gao Zhan, as usual.

368
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,920
Who made this into a rule?

369
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,920
(Zhang Peng, Su Hao)

370
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,721
Doofus Xu.

371
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,081
I'll sit with you this time.

372
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,520
I won't raise any complaints.

373
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,280
Who wants to sit with you?

374
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,280
I'm telling you.

375
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,000
She'll be calling my name next.

376
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:38,961
Ni Dapeng.

377
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:41,601
You heard that?

378
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,400
The Iron Throne is calling for Khaleesi.

379
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,961
Dodge!

380
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:47,721
Bye, my friend.

381
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,800
Bye, my friend.

382
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
Bye, my friend.

383
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,880
Why are you laughing?

384
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,400
Why can't I?

385
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,321
You fatty!

386
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,321
Who are you calling a fatty?

387
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,880
Xu Jingjing.

388
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:01,400
I wouldn't have the time to play
if I had grades like yours.

389
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:04,960
(Exciting Youth)

390
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:05,840
(Exciting Youth)
Here she comes.

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,520
(Exciting Youth)
She's here!

392
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,040
(Exciting Youth)
The Useless Queen born from the storm.

393
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:09,721
Xu...

394
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:10,641
Khaleesi!

395
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:11,441
Doofus Xu!

396
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:12,760
Jingjing!

397
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:14,560
Quiet down.

398
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,961
Don't go overboard.

399
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,881
Kang Jiawei.

400
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,721
I looked at your grades

401
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,721
from your previous school.

402
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:21,481
Not bad.

403
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,721
Top five, aren't you?

404
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,000
I got first place.

405
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,000
Then you...

406
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:34,921
You think it's not right too, don't you?

407
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:36,721
The top student sits next

408
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:37,760
to the worst...

409
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,241
Excuse me?

410
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:41,201
Finish your sentence.

411
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,000
Enough.

412
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
You two should learn to get along.

413
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,520
After half a semester

414
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
when you will have your end-of-term
exam, you can change your seats.

415
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,241
All right?

416
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,320
I'll try.

417
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,121
I wouldn't be smiling

418
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,241
if I see the exam papers here.

419
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,320
During this midterm exam,

420
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,000
our class didn't do so well.

421
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,401
Our class average

422
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,201
is ranked eighth.

423
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:03,000
It's mainly because some of us

424
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:04,760
scored really horribly

425
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,161
and it weighed the average down.

426
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,080
Especially math.

427
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:08,161
Half a semester of work

428
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,760
and you only got 48.

429
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,840
I don't know how you studied at all.

430
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,441
I won't say who.

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,080
Why are you looking at me?

432
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,641
How do you know it's me?

433
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,600
Jingjing.

434
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,560
You're good.

435
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,121
Even I got 52.

436
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:24,681
And you're proud of it?

437
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,641
Continue to work hard for those

438
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,360
who didn't score too well.

439
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,840
Ask if you have questions.

440
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,020
(Grade 11, Semester 1 Midterm Exam,
Math, Total: 48)

441
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,481
So it's you.

442
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,121
You're the worst student here.

443
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,121
You're crazy.

444
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,040
Look.

445
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,641
You did quite well for English.

446
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,681
It's just ten points away
from the passing grade.

447
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,161
Stop looking at my result.

448
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,401
You got it right here.

449
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,201
"My hands are tied" is not wrong.

450
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,121
It's correct.

451
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,800
"My hands are tied"
is a common expression

452
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
to describe inevitability.

453
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,000
A common expression?

454
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,080
How do you know this phrase?

455
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,641
It's in the TOEFL vocabulary.

456
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,201
I memorized them.

457
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,280
You already began memorizing

458
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,161
TOEFL vocabulary?

459
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,681
I was

460
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,881
bored.

461
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,780
(Baidu: my hands are tied)

462
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,681
This expression exists.

463
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,760
So Xu Jingjing

464
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,520
didn't make a mistake here.

465
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,940
(Grade 11, Semester 1 Midterm Exam,
English, Total: 80+2)

466
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:31,760
Let me rectify something.

467
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,201
The last place in this midterm exam

468
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,121
isn't Xu Jingjing

469
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:36,121
but Ni Dapeng.

470
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:37,641
Yes!

471
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,080
The throne is all yours.

472
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,641
Xu Jingjing! You...

473
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
Mr. Zhang asked me to tell you

474
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,881
that those who failed the math exam

475
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:48,961
have to attend

476
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,681
his tuition class.

477
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,921
It starts today after school.

478
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:53,401
No way.

479
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:53,961
Xu Jingjing.

480
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,600
You can change your seat if you want.

481
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,161
It's okay, Ms. Chen.

482
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,481
I want to sit here.

483
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,560
It's closer to the teacher's desk

484
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
and it helps my studies.

485
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:02,401
Are you sure?

486
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,721
Let's start now.

487
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Turn to page 37.

488
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:12,721
Genius.

489
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,961
Prodigy.

490
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,160
(Chinese)

491
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,520
(Chinese)
Thank you

492
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:18,560
for your intervention today.

493
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,721
I might have disrespected you

494
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:20,921
earlier.

495
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,121
For that, I apologize.

496
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,121
So...

497
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:26,201
Prodigy Kang.

498
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:27,681
Where do you live?

499
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,481
Do you live close to the school?

500
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:31,201
When do you come to school every day?

501
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:34,760
What do you want?

502
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:37,320
No.

503
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,000
I...

504
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:39,881
Can you come earlier?

505
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:42,201
I want to copy your homework.

506
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,800
Not for free.

507
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,080
I can give you this.

508
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,481
What is this?

509
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:53,840
My masterpiece.

510
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:55,921
Pipi stickers.

511
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,000
Only one copy in the world.

512
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:58,961
You know what?

513
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,040
I

514
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:02,520
will autograph here.

515
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,800
If one day

516
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:09,641
I become famous,

517
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,040
this will be worth a lot.

518
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:13,481
So?

519
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,000
XJJ?

520
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,280
You can study.

521
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,280
I'll leave you be.

522
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,540
(Gao's Observation Notebook)

523
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,800
Xu Jingjing.

524
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,641
Let's go.

525
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,201
Let's go.

526
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:49,280
Yes?

527
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,121
I didn't have time to thank you
this morning.

528
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,040
This is for you.

529
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,560
I've never opened it.

530
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,121
It's okay.

531
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,241
You can have it.

532
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:00,681
No need.

533
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm serious.

534
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,320
It's you.

535
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:06,441
What should we do

536
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,080
for the basketball match tomorrow?

537
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,921
I asked Zhang Chang'an for a leave

538
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,721
but he

539
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,641
turned me down right away.

540
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:12,320
I'll play then.

541
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,201
You?

542
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,320
Our class only has you as a substitute

543
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:16,560
but Class 6 has four.

544
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,481
They can sub them in in turns

545
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:18,320
and we will be exhausted to death.

546
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,520
Think this through.

547
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,520
You said it was me just now.

548
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:22,481
What do you mean?

549
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,560
Nothing.

550
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:26,441
I was mistaken.

551
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,481
I'll get something to eat then.

552
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,481
Wait.

553
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,760
You'll be there for the basketball match

554
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:32,681
tomorrow?

555
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:33,921
Of course.

556
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:34,681
The cheerleading team

557
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:35,921
has to attend the basketball match.

558
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:38,360
The final tomorrow is between

559
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:39,441
our class and Class 6?

560
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:41,401
In the tenth Grade,

561
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:42,800
our class lost to Class 6

562
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,840
in the final.

563
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,800
This is our comeback.

564
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,721
You like guys

565
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,201
who play basketball?

566
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
Everyone does.

567
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:51,161
I have to go now.

568
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:51,800
Bye.

569
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,600
B...

570
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,520
Bye.

571
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,961
I want to watch the match.

572
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,320
Xiaobai, are you okay?

573
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,800
Focus, Xiaobai.

574
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,760
My bum.

575
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,201
My bum hurts!

576
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,320
Didn't I tell you

577
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,201
to carry kick pads?

578
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,241
But you're too strong, President.

579
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,201
I want to quit.

580
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,040
Otherwise, I'll be kicked to death here.

581
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:33,760
If you quit,

582
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:34,600
our club will be

583
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,800
disbanded.

584
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,641
Disband it is.

585
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:40,360
It's fine anyway.

586
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:44,241
Jingjing.

587
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,401
I was joking just now.

588
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,320
It doesn't hurt that much.

589
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,721
It's fine.

590
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,681
I don't care about this.

591
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,681
I'm trying

592
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,520
to find a way to sneak into
the basketball match.

593
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,881
I don't think it's wise to skip

594
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,481
Zhang Chang'an's tuition class.

595
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,641
But I can't let him

596
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:00,721
ruin my plan.

597
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,481
What plan?

598
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,201
Are you sure you're not sick?

599
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,161
Who gave you the courage?

600
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:12,560
Your dream?

601
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:13,961
It's just a letter.

602
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,560
I know Gao Zhan well.

603
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:17,840
He's a Scorpio

604
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,040
and he has A-type blood.

605
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,320
He loves

606
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,441
an old-school, shy confession.

607
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,641
Fortunately,

608
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,961
my mom imported some

609
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Japanese matcha powder.

610
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:27,201
I'll make him

611
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:28,121
his favorite

612
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,481
matcha red bean milk tea.

613
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,161
Right.

614
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,241
Once the match is over,

615
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,441
I'll show it to him.

616
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,921
But what do you want, Jingjing?

617
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,000
Gao Zhan

618
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,600
sends Xu Jingjing home every day

619
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,520
suddenly this semester.

620
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,080
They will be together sooner or later.

621
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:46,441
But Gao Zhan

622
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:47,520
didn't sit with her

623
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,201
today.

624
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:48,921
Also,

625
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,241
I didn't see anything going on

626
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,121
between them in school.

627
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:52,360
You dummy.

628
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:53,641
They are discreet.

629
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:54,441
I think

630
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,040
you should study harder

631
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,481
and improve your grades.

632
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,921
In the next semester,

633
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,241
you can select another seat

634
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,721
closer to Gao Zhan.

635
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:04,441
That's more realistic.

636
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,161
Asking Jingjing to improve her grades

637
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,800
is almost impossible.

638
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,040
I think she can do it.

639
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,641
I wrote this letter

640
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,441
to Gao Zhan but I wasn't
expecting anything.

641
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:16,401
I just...

642
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:18,840
Yes?

643
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:23,721
I just want him to remember me.

644
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,600
Not as an

645
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,721
ordinary female classmate.

646
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,040
So you'll be another

647
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,921
fan girl then.

648
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:34,520
Are you two

649
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:35,760
my friends or not?

650
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:39,760
Whatever.

651
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,441
Either way,

652
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
I will be there

653
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,000
for the basketball match.

654
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,800
I know many of you are afraid of me.

655
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,080
Some even say

656
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,280
that my tuition class

657
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,961
is like a concentration camp.

658
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,000
Please

659
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,040
do not buy

660
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:02,320
into those baseless rumors.

661
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
My tuition class is very simple.

662
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,121
Solve math problems.

663
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
Whoever solves ten questions

664
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,161
can go back home.

665
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,121
Do not fall asleep.

666
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,641
Let's go.

667
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,401
Where are you going?

668
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,401
We...

669
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,080
We aren't going anywhere.

670
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:46,840
Your shoes are dirty.

671
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Let me shine them.

672
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,600
Happy new year in advance!

673
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:50,441
May you have a prosperous year!

674
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:50,961
Go back now.

675
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,241
You're staring at me.

676
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:58,840
Do I have the answers on my face?

677
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,401
Xu Jingjing.

678
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:02,760
If you think this is too difficult,

679
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,161
I can lower the requirement for you.

680
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,161
Or I can make it easier.

681
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,600
Junior high math
or elementary school math?

682
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:10,961
I can do elementary

683
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,201
school math.

684
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,320
Of course, you can.

685
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,401
If you can't solve the questions,

686
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,881
you won't be allowed back.

No need.

No need.

697

698
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:51,241

You're here, Mayonnaise.

705
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:49,161
It's Mayonnaise with Rice.

706
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,201
It's the same.

707
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,000
So,

708
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:52,280
how's your new school?

709
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,961
There are a lot of surprises.

710
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:56,921
I see.

711
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,401
A lot of cute girls?

712
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:01,760
There's one.

713
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,280
Tell me more.

714
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:05,721
She

715
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,360
is very pretty

716
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:11,080
and kind.

717
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,800
She's different

718
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:14,560
from other girls.

719
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,080
Oh.

720
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,881
Where did you get your Stranger Things

721
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:24,881
bracelet?

722
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:28,600
I didn't buy it.

723
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:29,840
I made it.

724
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:31,681
So it's one of a kind?

725
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:37,000
I guess?

726
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:40,641
I'm actually curious

727
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:42,560
as to why

728
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,121
you joined this group.

729
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,401
Because

730
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,000
I like the name.

731
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:49,881
"Why am I useless?"

732
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,000
is also a question I ask myself.

733
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:54,360
But you're not

734
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,161
useless.

735
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:56,881
Also,

736
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,681
you don't look like

737
00:30:58,881 --> 00:30:59,961
you give up easily.

738
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
How do you know?

739
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,201
You have never met me.

740
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:08,721
We've been talking for a long time

741
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:09,681
on the internet.

742
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,600
Have you thought about meeting up?

743
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:14,320
I have.

744
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,800
But I don't

745
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,961
want to scar you

746
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:20,320
with my ugliness.

747
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,641
If...

748
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:27,000
I mean, if,

749
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,000
I say I'm

750
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
a 100kg fatty,

751
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
will it bother you?

752
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,441
Then together,

753
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,080
we'll be

754
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,280
200kg!

755
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't worry, Mayonnaise.

756
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,721
Even if you're 100kg,

757
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,360
you can achieve something
with your talent.

758
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Is this a white lie?

759
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,520
No, I'm serious.

760
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,800
I always believe

761
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,760
that good looking people are everywhere

762
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,721
but good humor is hard to come by.

763
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,740
(If I say I'm a 100kg fatty, will it bother you?
Then together, we'll be 200kg!)

764
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,241

(Special Buns)
Xu Jingjing.

769
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,840
(Special Buns)
Morning, Jingjing.

770
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,340
(Special Buns)

771
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,441
With eggs and hams.

772
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:32,560
You need

773
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
a favor from me.

774
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:35,961
And you look a gift horse

775
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:37,040
in the mouth.

776
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:39,721
I feel bad for you
because you had tuition

777
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,760
until late at night

778
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:41,760
so I bought you breakfast.

779
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,320
And you're that generous?

780
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:45,360
Did you poison it?

781
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,961
Xu Jingjing.

782
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,280
You're paranoid.

783
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:49,840
Aren't you?

784
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:50,881
If you won't have it,

785
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,560
I will.

786
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:52,921
I'll eat it.

787
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,080
Why are you looking at me?

788
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:08,961
Something's on my teeth?

789
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:09,560
Nothing.

790
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,481
They are white and bright.

791
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,921
You can be

792
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,881
in a toothpaste ad.

793
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,681
Although the toothpaste factory

794
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:16,681
will go into bankruptcy.

795
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,520
Shut up if you have nothing good to say.

796
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,681
Didn't you

797
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:26,641
want to copy my homework?

798
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:32,560
This is yesterday's.

799
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,600
This is not right.

800
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:37,401
You're so kind out of a sudden.

801
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:38,401
You're plotting

802
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,241
something.

803
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:39,961
Madam.

804
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,600
Who gave you the confidence?

805
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:42,121
I...

806
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,000
You...

807
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,800
You drew Pipi?

808
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,320
How?

809
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:52,560
With an iPad and Photoshop.

810
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:53,961
I knew it.

811
00:33:58,441 --> 00:33:59,161
You know

812
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Photoshop very well then?

813
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,320
So so.

814
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,080
Just so you know,

815
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,201
I can't

816
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,960
make you look thin.

817
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:12,161
I didn't say I want you
to make me look thin.

818
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,081
Then what do you want?

819
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,280
I know

820
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,081
without me, our basketball team

821
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:23,521
is in shamble.

822
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Not necessarily.

823
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,480
I...

824
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,001
I will fight

825
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,161
Zhang Chang'an

826
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,121
to be here today.

827
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,001
Don't do anything reckless.

828
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,320
Otherwise, Mr. Zhang will think

829
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,561
I gave you the idea.

830
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,001
Just attend your tuition class.

831
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:36,960
We have Xiong.

832
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,400
He is an athlete

833
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,241
so I'm sure he has the stamina.

834
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,241
I'm just a hurdler.

835
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
I don't know if I'll be of much help.

836
00:34:43,721 --> 00:34:44,480
I can help.

837
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,081
Sorry.

838
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,561
The Sumo club is not here.

839
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,360
I heard Dapeng

840
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,001
has to attend the tuition class

841
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,081
and the basketball team needs someone.

842
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,520
(Personal Info)

843
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:53,480
(Personal Info)
Therefore, I came.

844
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:56,641
You see.

845
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:58,601
I was on my junior high basketball team.

846
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,800
How should I put this?

847
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,721
18 points on average per round.

848
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:02,601
Ten assists.

849
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:03,681
15 shots.

850
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:04,920
I also heard

851
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:06,081
that my juniors

852
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,041
worship me as a legend.

853
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:07,920
In addition,

854
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,521
I have analyzed the strengths
of those main players

855
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,601
in Class 6.

856
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,121
We can strike

857
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,001
at their weaknesses.

858
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:14,360
Although I'm new here,

859
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,121
I want to contribute

860
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:16,641
to our class too.

861
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:17,960
This is worthless.

862
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,280
Whoever scores five times will win.

863
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,800
Kang Jiawei is quite decent.

864
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,041
Rookie's luck.

865
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,840
He's just lucky.

866
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:42,521
Nice shot.

867
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:54,480
Dapeng.

868
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,840
Just attend your tuition class.

869
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,280
Are you abandoning me now?

870
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,960
It's okay, Dapeng.

871
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:02,081
You're the MVP

872
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:02,721
in my heart.

873
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,001
Captain.

874
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,880
Don't worry.

875
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:06,681
I won't let you down.

876
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,700
(Grade 11 Class 3)

877
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:13,121
Why are the questions getting tougher?

878
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:14,360
Tough?

879
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll give you something even tougher
next time.

880
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:18,041
No, please.

881
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:20,360
Why?

882
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:23,360
Do you want to wish me
a happy new year again today?

883
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,280
When the five star athletes
of Class 6 play,

884
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,081
Class 3 can only pray.

885
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,840
Gao Zhan the one-man army,

886
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,480
Gao Zhan the ruler of the field!

887
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:38,880
Make sure we maintain

888
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:39,521
our defense formation,

889
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,960
the 3-2 Zone Defense.

890
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,041
Pay attention to their forward,
Niu Junfeng.

891
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
Make sure he can't attack as often.

892
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,480
One, two, three.

893
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,320
All the best!

894
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:10,681
Hurry up.

895
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,081
It's time for you to return the favor.

896
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,960
I can only leave after I solve
ten questions.

897
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:52,721
Done?

898
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,440
Lend me the answer.

899
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:56,081
Good luck.

900
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,440
Xu Jingjing.

901
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,041
You still

902
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:12,840
have hopes, it seems.

903
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,041
With a little bit of pressure,

904
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
you can answer them correctly.

905
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,001
Can I leave then, Mr. Zhang?

906
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,280
Come back.

907
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:29,480
Yes?

908
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:31,521
You don't want your bag?

909
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:34,760
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

910
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:41,601
Sir!

911
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,641
Yes?

912
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:43,601
Mr. Zhang.

913
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,121
I want to go to the toilet.

914
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:49,800
I'll go with you.

915
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,001
It's okay.

916
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,201
I can hold it in.

917
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,641
Mom.

918
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,521
Can you lend me the milk tea machine?

919
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,681
Man the shop for me.

920
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:03,521
I had some dietary fiber supplement

921
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:04,400
and now my stomach hurts.

922
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,521
Hurry up then.

923
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:06,641
I have to go back to school later.

924
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:07,760
Yes.

925
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,641
Matcha.

926
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,001
Matcha.

927
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,081
Matcha.

928
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,360
Found you.

929
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,280
All the best!

930
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,840
You can do it!

931
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:27,561
All the best!

932
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Go! Class 3! Class 3 will win!

933
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,880
So?

934
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:34,480
Come. Sit here.

935
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,440
It just started.

936
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,400
It just started.

937
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:40,681
Jingjing.

938
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:41,880
You have

939
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:42,840
a rival today.

940
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:43,840
Who?

941
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:47,800
Someone is more eager than you.

942
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,161
Head down there

943
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:52,201
during intermission.

944
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,840
Shoot.

945
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,280
Quick, now.

946
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,880
Pass!

947
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,400
Stop him.

948
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,280
Pass it to me.

949
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,081
Well done!

950
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,920
Yes!

951
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,960
Yes!

952
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,161
Yes!

953
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,641
Defend!

954
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,041
Why are you so slow? Didn't eat enough?

955
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,521
What did I tell you?

956
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:50,840
Yes!

957
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,721
Gao Zhan the unparalleled.

958
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,400
Gao Zhan the Ace!

959
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,840
Yes!

960
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,280
It's intermission now.

961
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,121
Go down now.

962
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:05,920
Hurry up.

963
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,641
Go.

964
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,800
Your milk tea.

965
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,280
Here.

966
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,360
Don't forget it.

967
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:11,920
You got this!

968
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:13,280
Continue defending for the next half.

969
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,960
Gao Zhan.

970
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,681
Were you the one shouting

971
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,241
up there?

972
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,241
Sorry.

973
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,360
I was too excited.

974
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:25,041
So I...

975
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,601
It's okay.

976
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,721
You were right.

977
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,201
It rekindled our fighting spirit.

978
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,760
I...

979
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:32,440
Gao Zhan.

980
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:32,760
This is...

981
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:36,840
Your buzzer beater

982
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,840
was beautiful.

983
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,001
This Oolong tea is for you.

984
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:47,880
And this is?

985
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,681
Matcha red bean milk tea.

986
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,081
Thank you.

987
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,681
I'll have this.

988
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:12,081
Great!

989
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,400
Yes!

990
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,121
Gao Zhan is looking at you.

991
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,001
He is.

992
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,521
What should I do?

993
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:34,201
Make a love sign.

994
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:35,360
A love sign?

995
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,121
Hurry up.

996
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,360
No one can see this

997
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,601
tiny sign.

998
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,681
Make it more obvious.

999
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:54,920
Gao Zhan doesn't look all right.

1000
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,521
Is he sick?

1001
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,161
What happened to Gao Zhan?

1002
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:57,800
Xu Jingjing.

1003
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,081
What did you make me drink?

1004
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:04,161
Why did he ask for a break?

1005
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:05,880
What's going on?

1006
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:08,121
You're up.

1007
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,041
He was fine just now.

1008
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,360
Let's go!

1009
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:27,920
Sit back down!

1010
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,001
Don't joke around, buddy.

1011
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:30,760
Go!

1012
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,041
Oh, no.

1013
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,041
They subbed in Fatty Kang.

1014
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,840
Move! They have no more time.

1015
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:27,800
Defend and we'll win!

1016
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,280
Here.

1017
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,320
Here.

1018
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:31,760
Here.

1019
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,721
(You like guys)

1020
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,001
(who play basketball?)

1021
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,601
(Everyone does.)

1022
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,241
(Even if you're 100kg,)

1023
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,360
(you can achieve something
with your talent.)

1024
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:51,840
Time is running out. Shoot!

1025
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:52,880
Go!

1026
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:55,880
Shoot!

1027
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:00,280
