00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,359
Yes. Straighten your back.

17
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:43,759
Beautiful.

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Very good.

19
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:47,720
Okay, kids.

20
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,320
Let's rest for a while.

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Are you thinking
about your daughter again?

22
00:01:59,399 --> 00:01:59,999
There's nothing

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,800
that can't be solved between
a mother and her daughter.

24
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,119
Stop fighting with her.

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,479
Your child is going
to enter the university soon.

26
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,160
Then, you won't be able
to see her anymore

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,079
even if you want to.

Hello. Who are you looking for?

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,519
I have an appointment
with Manager Huang.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,639
Okay. This way, please.

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,759
Here.

33
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,120
Manager Huang.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,199
Come in.

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,679
You have a guest.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Hello.

37
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,359
You are Jingjing's mother, right?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,799
Come. Please take a seat.

39
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,160
Have a seat.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,199
Please drink some water.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,679
Thank you. I've brought my own water.

42
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,239
Okay.

43
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,280
Why are you here?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,679
I just want to learn more

45
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,679
about your company.

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,519
I'm sure you understand.

47
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,040
All mothers are the same.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,679
We don't want our children

49
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,519
to sign a contract
with an improper company.

50
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm not saying that you are
an improper company.

51
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,359
Please don't misunderstand me.

52
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,400
I understand.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
I have my own children too.

54
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,040
I understand how you feel.

55
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,040
Hurry up and introduce

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
the company to me.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,519
For example,

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,880
after she signs a contract
with your company,

59
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,759
will it affect her studies

60
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,040
or her life?

61
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,079
Hasn't Jingjing

62
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,199
told you yet?

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,880
What is it?

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,880
Jingjing told us

65
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,720
that she'll only consider

66
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,759
our offer

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,560
after the college entrance examination.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,959
We were very happy

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,479
when she said that.

70
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,120
Of course.

71
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:34,799
We also hope

72
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:35,720
that the artist

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,880
from our company

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
has a higher cultural literacy.

75
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,720
So, we are willing to wait for her.

76
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,880
Jingjing.

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,199
Your grade 12 motivation camp

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,759
will be here in two days' time.

79
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,079
Are you really not going
to tell your mum about it?

80
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,479
I don't have to tell her.

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,239
She must have seen it

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,040
in the parents' chat group already.

83
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,079
Are you really

84
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,519
going to ignore each other

85
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,359
for the rest of your life?

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,280
Tell me.

87
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,439
Do you really think

88
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,600
that your mum is that bad?

89
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:32,879
Let me tell you.

90
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,879
Actually, your mum

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,559
is just

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,760
a little bit impatient.

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,280
She has a sharp tongue.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,760
She's all bark and no bite.

95
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Although she looks

96
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,879
so fierce when she fights with you,

97
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,239
she has cried a lot

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,600
for you behind your back.

99
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,799
If your mum was really that bad,

100
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:54,999
do you think

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
that I would be able to spend
most of my life with her?

102
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
But comes to think of it,

103
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,239
you colluded with your friends last time

104
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,119
to deceive her about the examination.

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,879
That was

106
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,999
really your fault.

107
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,999
I know, dad.

108
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,359
That examination

109
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,720
was my fault.

110
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,439
Okay.

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,359
Let me ask you a question then.

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,919
If your mum

113
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,239
agrees to let you learn street dance

114
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,520
and allows you

115
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:26,040
to sign a contract with the company,

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
will you reconcile with her?

117
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,760
Dad.

118
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,640
She won't agree.

119
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
What if she does?

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,119
Can you apologise

121
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,200
to your mum first?

122
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,040
Good girl.

123
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,280
Okay now.

124
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,520
Come in.

125
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,119
Jingjing.

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,119
Mum.

127
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,679
Enough.

128
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:11,600
This is a good thing.

129
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,280
Don't get all emotional.

130
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,720
Right?

131
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,239
Come.

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,479
Sit here.

133
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,960
Have a nice chat with your daughter.

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,919
I'll check on the food.

135
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:27,799
Jingjing.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,359
Lately, I've been

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,160
thinking a lot by myself.

138
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:35,799
You are right.

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,080
I haven't been paying you
enough attention.

140
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:40,760
I...

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,239
I never thought

142
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,400
that you would

143
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,760
suffer so much from ballet.

144
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:51,520
Mum.

145
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,080
That examination was my fault.

146
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,720
Stop crying.

147
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,720
It was my fault.

148
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
I was too selfish.

149
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,439
Mum.

150
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,479
Actually,

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,879
I've been remembering the time

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,439
when I always saw you

153
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,600
by the barre or on the spectator seat

154
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,280
when I was learning ballet.

155
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,200
It makes me feel sure of myself.

156
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,600
Although

157
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,799
I've changed to a new platform,

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,119
I still hope

159
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,799
that I can see you
on the spectator seat.

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,280
For me,

161
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,559
if I have your support,

162
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,439
no matter what obstacles I face,

163
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,879
I won't be afraid.

164
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,720
Although I don't know

165
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,239
much about street dance,

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm willing to learn more about it.

167
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,439
I've watched a lot

168
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,600
of street dance videos lately.

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,720
It's quite cool.

170
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,720
Really?

171
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:01,799
Excuse me.

172
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,040
It's time to eat.

173
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,359
It's time to eat.

174
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,520
Let's go and eat.

175
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:07,840
The food is ready.

176
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,679
Today, it'll be a feast of meat.

177
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,720
No vegetables at all.

178
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:11,720
Mum.

179
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:14,119
Can I eat meat today?

180
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Eat as much as you want.

181
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,760
Okay now.

182
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,600
Come and eat now.

183
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,319
Come. Let's eat.

184
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,479
I want to sit with my mum.

185
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:21,919
Come.

186
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,439
Okay.

187
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,990
(Jiangsu Province: 2014 Student-Athlete
Recruitment Test Result)

188
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,520
Wait.

189
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,839
Xiong Shuai really took
his bag and left?

190
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,919
When I was
in the teacher's office just now,

191
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,360
I heard a call from his parents.

192
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,319
Xiong Shuai didn't pass
the Student-Athlete Recruitment Test.

193
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,839
So, he's going to quit school.

194
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,679
But he still has
the college entrance examination.

195
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,360
Maybe he feels
that it's pointless for him.

196
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,400
For him,
the college entrance examination

197
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,319
requires

198
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,240
even more cultural achievements.

199
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
What should we do now?

200
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,679
We can't

201
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,040
just do nothing while Xiong Shuai

202
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,439
sells vegetables with his parents.

203
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,719
Dapeng.

204
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:09,360
You are the closest to Xiong Shuai.

205
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,240
How about you talk to him first?

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,240
Okay.

207
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,520
Leave it to me.

208
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,319
I'll find a way

209
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,199
to bring Xiong Shuai back.

210
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,799
Young man.

211
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
What do you want to buy?

212
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,760
Come.

213
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,400
Our vegetables are really fresh.

214
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,880
I'm not here to buy vegetables.

215
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm here to look for someone.

216
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,160
You are here to look for someone?

217
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,599
Xiong Shuai.

218
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:38,640
Dapeng.

219
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,439
Xiong.

220
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Do you know how worried

221
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,160
everyone is when you don't go back

222
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,959
to school?

223
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,880
Help me thank them.

224
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,839
Are you just going

225
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,040
to sell vegetables with your parents?

226
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
Selling vegetables is not that bad.

227
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,839
I don't have to think.

228
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,199
And I don't have to run
under 15 seconds.

229
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,919
I already know about
the Student-Athlete Recruitment Test.

230
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,480
If you can't make it this year,

231
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,319
you can repeat the year.

232
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,799
Maybe I'll be repeating a year too.

233
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,280
Right?

234
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,719
Then,

235
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,919
we can be in the same class again.

236
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,959
Repeat a year?

237
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,640
Do you think I'm cut out for it?

238
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:17,839
If you train for another year,

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,319
it'll be easy for you
to get faster by one second.

240
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,880
The sports industry is different.

241
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,480
Even one second is very hard to achieve.

242
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
It requires strict training

243
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,719
and strict diet.

244
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,000
These things take money.

245
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,360
Repeating a year takes money too.

246
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,280
It hasn't been easy for my parents

247
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,599
to raise me until now.

248
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,120
I don't want

249
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,839
to burden them anymore.

250
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,000
What are you talking about?

251
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,280
You have me.

252
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,799
Am I not your best friend?

253
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll pay for

254
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,439
your training fees

255
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,480
and school fees.

256
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,160
You can pay me back when you've become

257
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:49,719
the next Liu Xiang.

258
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,959
Or you don't have to pay me back.

259
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,599
What are you laughing at?

260
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,640
I just think that since
I don't have the talent,

261
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,599
I shouldn't waste my youth on it.

262
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,640
Are you going

263
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,199
to sacrifice your youth
on the farmers' market?

264
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,760
Are you looking down on greengrocers?

265
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,640
No.

266
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,480
That's not what I meant.

267
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:09,640
Every occupation is noble.

268
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,760
Be proud of your own hard work.

269
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,679
What I meant is,

270
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,199
you can be so much more than this.

271
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,760
Thank you, Dapeng.

272
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,599
I've already made up my mind.

273
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,520
Tell the other students

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,679
to study hard.

275
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,240
No.

276
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,240
It's late already.

277
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,400
You should go back now.

278
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,240
I can't ask you to stay for dinner.

279
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,799
I need to help my mum
to close the store.

280
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,000
Xiong Shuai.

281
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,679
He's really a greengrocer now?

282
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,719
I tried my best to change his mind.

283
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,040
But he refused to listen to me.

284
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,079
Even if he failed
the Student-Athlete Recruitment Test,

285
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,040
there's still
the college entrance examination.

286
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:56,679
That's right.

287
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,240
He has put so much effort into it.

288
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,839
He can't just give up.

289
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,480
That's right.

290
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:01,839
If he quits right now,

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,160
he can't even get
the High School Diploma.

292
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,280
It'll be hard for him in the future

293
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,839
with just
a secondary school certificate.

294
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,719
Ni Dapeng.

295
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,599
Did you

296
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,559
talk properly to him?

297
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:10,799
I...

298
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,559
Of course I did.

299
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,000
I was one step away from showing him

300
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,919
my heart.

301
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,079
We can't let this be.

302
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,919
We have to make him come back

303
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:17,839
to take
the college entrance examination.

304
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,480
Is there

305
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,559
anything that we can do?

306
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,520
I have an idea.

307
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:45,240
Boss.

308
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,679
Are you here to sell things
or play with your phone?

309
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:47,520
Xu Jingjing?

310
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,919
Don't be nervous.

311
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,719
I'm not here to ask you to go back.

312
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,679
I'm just passing back.

313
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,959
So, I want to buy some vegetables.

314
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,280
I want to support your business.

315
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,799
Stop joking with me.

316
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,040
I'm not joking with you.

317
00:12:58,199 --> 00:12:59,559
I think being a greengrocer is not bad.

318
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,559
It's true.

319
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:01,760
I want to be a greengrocer too.

320
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:02,839
Does your family need another helper?

321
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:03,640
Stop joking around.

322
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,240
What do you want?

323
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,040
I'll give them to you for free.

324
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,919
You can't do that.

325
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
Business is business.

326
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,640
If you don't let your friends pay,

327
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,559
your business will suffer a great loss.

328
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,599
I have to pay you.

329
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:13,520
Then...

330
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,640
Then, let me give you a discount then.

331
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,839
If you say that,
I'll buy from another store then.

332
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay then.

333
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,959
Take a look at what you want.

334
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,079
I think

335
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
your tomatoes are quite fresh.

336
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,400
I want

337
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:35,280
all of them.

338
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:37,480
What's wrong?

339
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,799
I want them all.

340
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,120
I love tomatoes.

341
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,439
Tomatoes are my life.

342
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:48,319
Give all the potatoes to me.

343
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,240
I want the potatoes.

344
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,199
What's wrong?

345
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,360
Are you unwilling to sell them to me?

346
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,439
Who am I?

347
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,799
I am a customer.

348
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The customer is always right.

349
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,000
You need to serve me with a smile, okay?

350
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,959
Smile.

351
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,040
Cauliflower.

352
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,559
I love cauliflower the most.

353
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,520
Can you give me more?

354
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,679
I'll pay you.

355
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,599
I want them all.

356
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:06,919
Dapeng wants potatoes.

357
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
So, I'll take the green bell peppers.

358
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,199
I want lettuce, zucchini

359
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,319
and this chilli.

360
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,120
As for the rest,

361
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,959
all in!

362
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,880
Miss Chen.

363
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,400
Miss Chen.

364
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
We did it

365
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,160
because we really want him

366
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,839
to come back to school.

367
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,040
I understand how you feel.

368
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:47,880
But I hope

369
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,480
that you better focus on your studies

370
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,839
at this critical time.

371
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,360
Now is not the time

372
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,520
for you to step in.

373
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,000
Miss Chen.

374
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,360
Xiong Shuai is already like this.

375
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,480
We can't leave him alone.

376
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,839
The school is talking

377
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,079
to his parents about this now.

378
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,520
I think

379
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,000
you should believe in the school

380
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
and the teachers.

381
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
We'll do our best.

382
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,799
Don't worry about him.

383
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:18,120
Xiong Shuai has told me this

384
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,000
when he called me.

385
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,319
He doesn't hope that your studies

386
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,959
will be affected because of him.

387
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,919
If that happens,

388
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,199
he'll feel so guilty.

389
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,240
Right?

390
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,919
I think

391
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,559
we should believe that Xiong Shuai

392
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,240
can make the right choice.

393
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,480
You should learn from him.

394
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,040
Especially those of you

395
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,360
who failed the first mock exam.

396
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,679
You can't fail

397
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,880
the second mock exam again.

398
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:42,559
Understand?

399
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,360
♪I see the stars are inseparable♪

400
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,800
♪I see the dawn is nearing♪

401
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,080
♪Whenever I'm helpless and quiet,

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,640

403

♪Be brave and step forward.

404
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,280

♪Don't be fear.

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,799
Pine, plum blossom, bamboo and
chrysanthemum are the symbol of virtue

407
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,799
that don't fear evil.

408
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
Ancient people often use
these four images

409
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,319
to represent nobility and virtue.

410
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:57,880
To...

411
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,000
Why is the electricity suddenly cut off?

412
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,159
Okay now, students.

413
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,200
That's it for today.

414
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,720
Pack your things and go home.

415
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,559
Miss Chen.

416
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,559
Will this work?

417
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,760
Miss Chen, continue with the lesson.

418
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,040
We can see the blackboard now.

419
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,280
That's right, Miss Chen.

420
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,079
Continue with the lesson.

421
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,159
We don't want to go home.

422
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,440
That's right, Miss Chen.

423
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,040
That's right.

424
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,359
Continue with the lesson.

425
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,920
We don't want to go home.

426
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:54,720
Continue with the lesson.

427
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,079
Okay. Let's continue then.

428
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,159
We use the moon
as a symbol of homesickness.

429
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,680
When the moon is high in the air,

430
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,559
it'll often

431
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,760
cause a feeling of homesickness.

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,079
For instance, Du Fu's

433
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
"Missing My Brother
under the Moonlight".

434
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,879
The lunisolar will start today.

435
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,720
But the moon shines the brightest
in my home town.

436
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:12,599
And another example is

437
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,520
Su Shi.

438
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,040
Separation is inevitable.

439
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,920
Just like the moon
with different phases.

440
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,760
They are all describing
the poets' homesickness

441
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,200
and how they miss
their family and friends.

442
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,200
When Miss Chen

443
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,920
talked about missing a friend,

444
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,079
I straight away
thought about Xiong Shuai.

445
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,599
Me too.

446
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,480
I don't know what he's doing now.

447
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,680
Let's get through this year

448
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,760
and live without regrets!

449
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
Great!

450
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,639
This is a path that we have to walk on.

451
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,839
We will not stop until
we've achieved what we want!

452
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,440
Good!

453
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,920
We'll only go through Grade 12 once.

454
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,119
I'll always remember

455
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,559
Grade 12 Class 7!

456
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,520
Amazing!

457
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,440
All of our hard work
until now is for this!

458
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,639
Let's do our best
in our coming examination!

459
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,960
Nice!

460
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,280
Conic section,

461
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,599
die!

462
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,520
Yes!

463
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,920
Wang Jiayao,

464
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,440
may you do well
in your college examination

465
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,760
and your second mock test!

466
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,000
Awesome!

467
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
(Kang Jiawei)

468
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:49,920
Master Kang.

469
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,920
Are you still trying to brainwash me?

470
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:53,799
I hope

471
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,799
that our friend

472
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,440
can change his mind

473
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,119
and fight together with us!

474
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,079
Nice!

475
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
Xiong Shuai!

476
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,280
Come back now!

477
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,200
It's just
a college entrance examination!

478
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,520
We'll fight with you until the end!

479
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,839
Xiong, come back!

480
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,680
No one understands my humour!

481
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,879
I feel lonely without you!

482
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,599
Xiong Shuai!

483
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,159
If you don't come back,

484
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,879
Dapeng is going to be lovesick!

485
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,960
Xiong Shuai!

486
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,280
Come back!

487
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,319
Let's do our best

488
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,159
and conquer the examination!

489
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,599
No matter how hard it is, hang on!

490
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,879
Leave no regrets!

491
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,079
Although we start from small,

492
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,119
we'll end with a bang!

493
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,040
The arts stream wishes
the science stream

494
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,599
all the best and get
into the top universities!

495
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,520
The science stream wishes

497
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,760
All the best in
the college entrance examination!

498
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,359

(63 Days to
the College Entrance Examination)

503
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:47,839
Something has happened!

504
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,799
Something has happened!

505
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,040
What happened?

506
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:50,839
Xiong Shuai...

507
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,280
What happened to Xiong Shuai? Tell us.

508
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
He's back!

509
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:03,960
I was very foolish, right?

510
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,599
It happens to everyone.

511
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,599
Look at Dapeng.

512
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,280
He's acting foolish all the time.

513
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,079
Jiayao.

514
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,920
This is not how you comfort someone.

Don't leave again after this.

That's right.

518
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:16,960
We missed you so much

519
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,119
when you were not here.

520
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,200
Because of you,

521
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,839
Dapeng and I ate stir-fry potato
with green bell pepper

Are we competing about who had it worse?

524
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,079
I ate stir-fry tomato with egg

for half a month.

526

Thank you, everyone.

Thank you for not giving up on me.

As usual.

541
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,319
Is this for real?

542
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,079
Am I really that lucky?

543
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:01,599
No.

544
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
Did you do something to the cards?

545
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:02,879
Show them to me.

546
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,520
I wouldn't do that.

547

I was too positive before this.

552

I had talked to the doctor
in the past two days.

553
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,559
I don't understand.

554
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:30,760
Why didn't he tell me about it

555
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,559
sooner?

556
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,559
If he had told me about it,

557
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,559
I could spend more time with him.

558
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,200
Maybe he wanted to tell you

559
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,680
about it after the examination.

560
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:40,399
What if

561
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,399
something bad happened to him?

562
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:42,760
Are the cancer cells

563
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,599
under his command?

564
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm sorry.

565
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,720

Go back to your studies.

687
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,480
Okay, Miss Chen.

688
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,639
I got it.

689
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,920
Thank you.

690
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
Wei!

691
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,000
Where were you?

692
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,799
I was so worried about you.

693
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,200
How is

694
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,399
my dad now?

695
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,200
Wei.

696
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,559
You have to hang in there.

697
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:07,839
The doctor

698
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,079
has given us the notice
of critical illness.

699
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,879
Stop it.

700
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:16,520
Wei.

701
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,639
I just called Miss Chen

702
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,399
on the phone.

703
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,839
The classes are still ongoing.

704
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,359
You should go back to school first.

705
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,399
I have asked Xu Jingjing

706
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,359
to apply for a leave of absence
from school.

707
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:25,639
Xu Jingjing?

708
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,440
Xu Jingjing is a nice kid.

709
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:32,000
Before I came back,

710
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,680
she took care of your dad

711
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,960
when he was not feeling well.

712
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,760
She took care of my dad?

713
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
What do you mean?

714
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,799
Wei.

715
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,799
You haven't slept
the whole night, right?

716
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,920
How about you go home first?

717
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,480
No. What did you

718
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,680
say just now?

719
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,879
Xu Jingjing took care of my dad?

720
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,480
Wei!

721
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,359
Jingjing.

722
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
You should eat something.

723
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,720
You can't starve yourself.

724
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,559
I don't have the appetite.

725
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,440
You can eat mine.

726
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,920
Do you want to eat instant noodles?

727
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,520
I'll buy it for you.

728
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,119
I don't want to eat.

729
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,200
Kang Jiawei, why are you here?

730
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,280
Has your dad gotten better?

731
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,040
What happened to your dad?

732
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,440
Don't scare me, Kang Jiawei.

733
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:43,680
Say something.

734
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,680
Why did you keep it a secret from me?

735
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:50,200
You knew it a long time ago.

736
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,200
Why didn't you tell me?

737
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,040
Why didn't you tell me

738
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,559
that my dad is sick?

739
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,280
Why?

740
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:03,639
I...

741
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,119
Your dad asked me to keep it
a secret from you.

742
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,239
Kang Jiawei.

743
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:12,920
Let go of me!

744
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,000
I have nothing to say to you now.

745
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,400
Do you understand?

746
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,599
I have something to say to you.

747
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm sorry.

748
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,199
I didn't do it on purpose.

749
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,440
I wanted to tell you about it.

750
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,360
But he told me

751
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,079
that he didn't want
to affect your studies.

752
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:22,920
Two months.

753
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,040
Two months.

754
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,880
I lost two months because of you.

755
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,719
I could've spent two more months

756
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
with my dad.

757
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,840
Yes.

758
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,679
My dad asked you not to tell me.

759
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Of course he would say that.

760
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,040
But what about you?

761
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,520
Couldn't you make

762
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,480
your own decision?

763
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,520
If you had used your brain,

764
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,840
you would've told me about it!

765
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm sorry.

766
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm sorry.

767
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,599
Stop apologising to me!

768
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
Unless you can give me back

769
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,639
those two months.

770
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,360
Can you do that?

771
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,679
I...

772
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm sorry.

773
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,199
I'm sorry.

774
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm sorry.

775
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,040
Kang Jiawei.

776
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,719
Actually, I still have a lot of things

777
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,639
to tell you.

778
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,440
But I know

779
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
that no matter what I say,

780
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,279
you won't forgive me.

781
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,079
But whether you forgive me or not,

782
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,520
I still have to wish your dad

783
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,000
all the best.

784
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,079
I still have to wish you

785
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,360
all the best
for your college entrance examination.

786
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,199
Kang Jiawei.

787
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,679
I'm sorry.

788
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,199
Wei.

789
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,719
I'm back.

790
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,119
Where is he?

791
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:04,000
Wei.

792
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,840
Wei.

793
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,239
Wei, what's wrong?

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,599
I'm fine.

795
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,360
No. Are you sick?

796
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,199
As I said, I'm fine.

797
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,440
You are not fine.

798
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,960
Can you leave me alone?

799
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,040
No!

800
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Because I'm your mum!

801
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,719
Are you my mum?

802
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,040
Why didn't you say that you are my mum

803
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,320
when you left me and my dad?

804
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,400
Wei.

805
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,480
I admit

806
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,960
that back then,

807
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,320
I was too selfish.

808
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,279
All these years,

809
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
I've been

810
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,960
regretting it in every moment
of my life for leaving you.

811
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
In the past ten years,

812
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,880
you refused to talk to me.

813
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,079
I know

814
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,040
that you hate me.

815
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,320
But

816
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,920
your dad

817
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:16,960
is in the ICU now.

818
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,840
We have to stick together

819
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,320
to solve

820
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,639
all future obstacles that come our way.

821
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,079
Solve?

822
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,599
How can we solve this?

823
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,040
Can you make my dad

824
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:39,840
come out

825
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
from the ICU in the pink of health?

826
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,719
Can you make Xu Jingjing

827
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:43,279
tell me about the truth

828
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,199
two months ago?

829
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,159
Can you not file a divorce with my dad

830
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,279
and relive the past 10 years and more?

831
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,480
Wei.

832
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:02,880
Do you think

833
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,639
I wanted your gifts?

834
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:05,759
Do you know

835
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,639
what I wanted?

836
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,559
After you left,

837
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,719
I kept thinking

838
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,520
that you might come back

839
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,320
to us one day.

840
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,360
But you didn't.

841
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,279
Every year,

842
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
my only connection with you

843
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,880
were these cold and unfeeling gifts.

844
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,000
You say that I hate you.

845
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,000
Do I really hate you?

846
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,000
You kept asking my dad

847
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,279
about how I felt about you.

848
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,000
This is the answer.

849
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:17,960
(Mum.)

850
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:19,639
(Long time no see.)

851
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,079
(I am Kang Jiawei.)

852
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,599
(What do you think?)

853
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:27,759
(I look quite handsome)

854
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:28,840
(after I slim down, right?)

855
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:32,320
(I'm recording this video)

856
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,920
(because David contacted me.)

857
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,559
(He wants me)

858
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,800
(to give you my blessings
for your marriage.)

859
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,279
(Maybe he thinks)

860
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,480
(that you'll be surprised)

861
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,159
(to see a video from me.)

862
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,960
(Actually,)

863
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,159
(I want to ask you a question.)

864
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,639
(After leaving us,)

865
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,719
(have you found your happiness?)

866
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,279
(Have you found the life you want?)

867
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,920
(If you have,)

868
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,719
(why do you want to come back)

869
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:00,400
(to look for me)

870
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
(who is a thief and a sinner?)

871
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:57,599
Wei.

872
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,559
I know

873
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,880
that it's pointless for me
to say anything now.

874
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:07,159
But

875
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,360
I still want

876
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:12,040
to apologise to you.

877
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,920
I love you.

878
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,320
I really love you.

879
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,639
It's true.

880
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:24,440
I filed for a divorce

881
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,000
with your dad

882
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,480
and left the country

883
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,040
not because I hated you.

884
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,159
But it's because

885
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
I couldn't handle

886
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,960
that marriage anymore.

887
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,360
But

888
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,360
I didn't want

889
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,719
to be just a mother
for the rest of my life.

890
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,360
Of course.

891
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,040
It has nothing to do with you.

892
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,000
You are not a thief.

893
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,520
For the first few years
after I went abroad,

894
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,320
I could see

895
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,040
your face every night

896
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
when I closed

897
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,759
my eyes.

898
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,679
And you would call me "mum".

899
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,279
I'm sorry, Wei.

900
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,800
I was too selfish.

901
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:32,360
If I could turn back the time
to 10 years ago,

902
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,719
I wouldn't have chosen

903
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,800
to leave you behind.

904
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,719
I'm not a good mother.

905
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:53,119
I'm sorry.

907
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,159
Mum.

908
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:24,719
Let's wait for our dad
to come back to us.

909
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,679
Let's wait for him to come back to us.
