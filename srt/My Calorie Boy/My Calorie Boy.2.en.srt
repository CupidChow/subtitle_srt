Alright!

23
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,370
We won!

24
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,889
Nice.

25
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,449
Nice!

26
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:38,250
Jingjing.

27
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,050
Jingjing.

28
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,569
Are you alright?

29
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,129
Of course not.

30
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:49,930
Anyway,

31
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,009
do you think Gao Zhan is okay?

32
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,169
He's fine.

33
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,449
He just has diarrhea.

34
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,370
What did you give him?

35
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,050
I didn't give him anything.

36
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:01,490
It was his favorite

37
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,090
Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea.

38
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:04,889
Have you given the letter

39
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:05,689
you wrote to him?

40
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,129
Forget it.

41
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,770
Our class lost in the match.

42
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:09,849
And I got whacked

43
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,970
by Fatty Kang.

44
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,289
So much for spending
the whole night writing it.

45
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,090
It's all over.

46
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:21,970
Where's my letter?

47
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:22,849
What's wrong?

48
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,289
The letter is gone.

49
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:36,689
What's the matter?

50
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,050
Why all the sighing?

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,009
Here, have the chicken thigh.

52
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,530
I don't have appetite.

53
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,330
What's wrong?

54
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:48,370
Did you fail a test again?

55
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:49,889
What do you mean "again"?

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,409
When has Jingjing ever passed?

57
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,090
Dad!

58
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,609
This is reverse encouragement.

59
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,409
I'm encouraging you.

60
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,449
So if it's not about your studies,

61
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,970
then did some boy

62
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:03,810
go after you?

63
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,370
What are you babbling about, Mom?

64
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:09,289
As

65
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,090
an experienced wedding host,

66
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,609
you can ask me any questions

67
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:13,689
on relationships.

68
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,729
Come, miss.

69
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:15,609
What is bothering you?

70
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,570
What are you worried about?

71
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,049
Feel free to tell me.

72
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,169
Save it, Dad.

73
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,929
It's not that.
Don't go running off on a tangent.

74
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:21,690
See? It's not that.

75
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,809
It's not.

76
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:24,049
No need to worry.

77
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,770
Eat then.

78
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,289
So,

79
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,169
how do you feel

80
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:30,090
after taking that?

81
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,570
Is it smooth?

82
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:32,450
What?

83
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,369
The dietary fiber powder.

84
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:35,970
I saw you opening

85
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,970
the can.

86
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,609
Jingjing,

87
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,130
if you have constipation,

88
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,890
take some every day.

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,289
Alright, alright.

90
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,849
It works wonders.

91
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:44,770
Can you not talk

92
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,249
about constipation in front of food?

93
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,929
How are we supposed to eat?

94
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:48,650
Come.

95
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:49,010
What's wrong with it?

96
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:49,890
Eat the juicy shrimp.

97
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,849
Mom!

98
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,570
I'm invisible, I'm invisible...

99
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,489
I'm invisible, I'm invisible...

100
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,169
I'm invisible...

101
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,970
I'm invisible, I'm invisible.

102
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:13,729
Please!

103
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,809
Just leave.

104
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,970
Xu Jingjing.

105
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,169
Haven't you left?

106
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:22,929
Are you avoiding me?

107
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,450
I thought you'd be upset

108
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,090
to see me.

109
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,729
Upset to see you?

110
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:29,489
Why?

111
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,450
I caused you

112
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:32,609
to have diarrhea yesterday.

113
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,130
And our class lost the match
because of it.

114
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,130
We can win the next match.

115
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,289
I know you didn't mean it.

116
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,369
Don't worry about it.

117
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:42,729
Really?

118
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,650
Thanks, Gao Zhan.

119
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,210
How about this?

120
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:47,729
Would you like

121
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,090
a membership card from our store?

122
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,330
Consider it my apology to you.

123
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:51,609
No, it's okay.

124
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:52,570
I'm off.

125
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:53,369
You should hurry too.

126
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:03,609
Jingjing.

127
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,130
What are you smiling sheepishly for?

128
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,530
Guess who I bumped into just now?

129
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,489
It had to be Gao Zhan.

130
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,770
Did you get in his way again?

131
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,130
"Excuse me."

132
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,409
"Can you move aside?"

133
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,289
No.

134
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,729
He didn't say that today.

135
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:18,890
This time,

136
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,249
he said a lot to me.

137
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:20,809
Tell me.

138
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,249
It's a blessing in disguise, right?

139
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:25,369
You survived Kang Jiawei's

140
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:25,929
bump yesterday.

141
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,409
I think your luck must have turned

142
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,210
for the better.

143
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,049
Right?

144
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,570
I wouldn't be so unlucky.

145
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,249
Then what about your letter?

146
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,409
I can always write another.

147
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,500
(Humble and Adaptive,
Virtues and Duty)

148
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,890
I told you the match is a goner

149
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:43,890
without me.

150
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,049
Fatty is literally useless.

151
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,049
What's this?

152
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,849
It's pink.

153
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,210
And is smells of lavender.

154
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,049
You're invading other people's privacy.

155
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:08,609
"XOXO."

156
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,049
Give it back!

157
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:09,849
What awful handwriting.

158
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,330
Xu Jingjing must have written it.

159
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,929
Give it back!

160
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:14,729
Stop her.

161
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:16,890
What's up?

162
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,489
Xu Jingjing.

163
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:18,330
You're up.

164
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,929
Who knew you had such
extraordinary taste?

165
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,970
So you like our dear Kang?

166
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,609
Where did you get that?

167
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,090
Let me read it.

168
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:23,890
-Where did you get it?
-Let me see.

169
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,330
Ni Dapeng!

170
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:26,530
Give me back my letter!

171
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:27,450
"Hello."

172
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:27,929
Stop reading!

173
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,210
"I finally gathered my courage"

174
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:30,330
"to write this letter to you."

175
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,409
"You may not know this,"

176
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,130
"but the first time"

177
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:32,929
"I met you,"

178
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,890
-"I've..."
-Stop it!

179
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:37,489
Xu Jingjing.

180
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,970
Miss... I'm fine, Ms. Chen.

181
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,570
Why did you write
the letter to Kang Jiawei?

182
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,450
XJJ is not you?

183
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:50,929
Then who is it?

184
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,650
What if it is Xu Jingjing?

185
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,249
Xu Jingjing's handwriting isn't so ugly.

186
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,010
Then...

187
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,090
It could be...

188
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,090
Xiao Jiejie.

189
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:02,729
Xi Jiejing.

190
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,330
Xiang Jiaojun.

191
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,849
Xu Jinjiang.

192
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:05,609
It must be him.

193
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:07,849
Are you done?

194
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,169
But... I really didn't write
a love letter

195
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,130
to Kang Jiawei.

196
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,090
"Watching you ride on the bicycle,"

197
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,650
"with your jacket
billowing in the wind,"

198
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:21,970
"you look so handsome."

199
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:22,929
Bad structure.

200
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,210
"The way you look when
you're doing homework"

201
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,289
"next to the sunlit window"

202
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:29,330
"is so deep."

203
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,130
Did you

204
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,090
learn this language from the PE teacher?

205
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,290
You taught it.

206
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,570
You better not say that.

207
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:34,529
I have a reputation to keep.

208
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,450
"When I see you..."

209
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,330
Please stop, Ms. Chen.

210
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,009
If you tell me who you wrote it for,

211
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,810
I'll stop.

212
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,729
The basketball match yesterday.

213
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,609
I heard you gave Gao Zhan a drink.

214
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,129
I gave him a drink

215
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,769
because he's the captain.

216
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,129
The class will win

217
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,369
if he's in good form.

218
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,210
It's for Class 3's sake.

219
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,489
I think you care more about Gao Zhan.

220
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:04,489
Not true.

221
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,529
Alright.

222
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:07,810
You may go back.

223
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,930
Get Gao Zhan for me.

224
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,290
I'll hear his side of the story.

225
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:11,849
I'll say it.

226
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:16,889
Actually,

227
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,050
I...

228
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,129
wrote it for Kang Jiawei.

229
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:21,609
You just said

230
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,769
it wasn't for him.

231
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:23,410
I wrote it.

232
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,450
Yes, I did.

233
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,529
I like Kang Jiawei.

234
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,810
Okay, I see.

235
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,489
Go back to class.

236
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,849
Students having puppy love.

237
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:50,849
Sir.

238
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,210
Ms. Chen.

239
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,210
You're unfamiliar
since you didn't teach Grade Ten.

240
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,249
Xu Jingjing

241
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,849
is not known for being a smart student.

242
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,690
She's always up to no good.

243
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,009
A word of advice.

244
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,050
You must not let this slide.

245
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,930
It has to be dealt with thoroughly.

246
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:08,170
They're going to be seniors next year.

247
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,570
But their results are still
bottom of the batch.

248
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,009
They should focus on their studies,

249
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,529
not love and dating.

250
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,529
Rest assured, sir.

251
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:18,930
I'll handle it well.

252
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:22,090
I don't think so.

253
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,050
Did you really believe her when she said

254
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,810
it's for Kang Jiawei?

255
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:29,729
I don't think

256
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,009
we need to pursue this.

257
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,129
Xu Jingjing is not a bad kid.

258
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:35,769
It's normal for children

259
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,889
going through puberty

260
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,769
to be interested in others.

261
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,489
We just have to guide them properly.

262
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:40,849
Besides,

263
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,129
this is her privacy.

264
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:43,649
What privacy do students have?

265
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,050
Do they need privacy?

266
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,410
Their job is to study.

267
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,529
Xu Jingjing's matter

268
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,690
has to be taken seriously.

269
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,729
Find out exactly who her crush is.

270
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,529
Otherwise, if they get together

271
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,129
and start dating in secret,

272
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,129
you'll be in real trouble

273
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,729
when the parents come demanding answers.

274
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:03,009
Ms. Chen.

275
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,210
You're still young.

276
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,849
You're inexperienced
being a homeroom teacher.

277
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,849
If you fail

278
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:09,649
to nip such bad practices

279
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,849
in the bud,

280
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,930
it will quickly manifest

281
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:14,970
into bigger problems.

282
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,210
That's enough, President.

283
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,249
Blackie can't take anymore!

284
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:47,810
I'm not the president.

285
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,249
This club is dead.

286
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,849
From today onward,

287
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,769
my future in the club is no more.

288
00:11:58,769 --> 00:11:59,090
Come on.

289
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,330
Why did you admit it then?

290
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:03,450
Because Ms. Chen

291
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:04,889
was that close to guessing the person.

292
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,369
And you didn't want her to know

293
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:08,489
that the real person you idolize

294
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:09,690
is Gao Zhan.

295
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,170
So,

296
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,009
you protected your real secret.

297
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,729
Then it worked out.

298
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:18,769
I just want to know.

299
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,690
Who put my letter

300
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:23,090
in Kang Jiawei's desk?

301
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,970
I read the letter a few times.

302
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,330
I don't think

303
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:33,369
you wrote it for Kang Jiawei.

304
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,050
Who is the real recipient?

305
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:39,090
And how

306
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,249
did it end up with Kang Jiawei?

307
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,769
Jiawei doesn't ride a bicycle.

308
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,769
It's not like what you wrote.

309
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,330
And you said,

310
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,609
"The way you look when"

311
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,090
"you're doing homework."

312
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,849
The one sitting beside
the window is Gao Zhan, no?

313
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,009
Ms. Chen!

314
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,170
I do ride a bicycle.

315
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,769
And I also sit by the window.

316
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:06,330
What are you doing here?

317
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:08,129
Ms. Chen.

318
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,249
There's something you should know.

319
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:12,729
Xu Jingjing and I

320
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,330
went to the same middle school.

321
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:18,849
Is that so, Jingjing?

322
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,369
Ms. Chen.

323
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,170
Don't be fooled by my rotund body now.

324
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,889
I used to be slim and handsome
in middle school.

325
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:31,450
Is that true?

326
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,090
I never thought

327
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,410
we'd meet again here.

328
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,050
What's more? I'm shocked

329
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,849
that she still harbors feelings for me.

330
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:45,970
But don't worry, Miss.

331
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,410
I don't like her.

332
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,450
And,

333
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,009
I'll help you in ensuring

334
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:51,769
that she gives up her crush on me.

335
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,090
Don't look at me.

336
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,009
Go back and write a self-inspection.

337
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,009
Hand it in tomorrow.

338
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,500
(Self-inspection)

339
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,529
What should I do,

340
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,450
Pipi?

341
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,660
(Don't cross the line)

342
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:43,249
Miss.

343
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:45,290
Didn't you see the red light?

344
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,930
I'm sorry.

345
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:50,930
I'm...

346
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,210
What are you doing?

347
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,529
I didn't penalize you.

348
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,249
But you'll help maintain traffic order.

349
00:14:58,849 --> 00:14:59,369
No, I can't.

350
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:00,810
I need to get to class.

351
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,330
You may go

352
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,129
once you catch the next offender.

353
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,180
(Safe travels, civilized courtesy)

354
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,580
(Don't cross the line)

355
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:23,970
Xu Jingjing?

356
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,729
What are you up to?

357
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,729
Trying to be an exemplary citizen?

358
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:28,570
Let me take a picture.

359
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,529
Hey, Kang Jiawei.

360
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,170
Look at me. Hurry up.

361
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:32,330
You got me in trouble yesterday

362
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,290
and you still want more?

363
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,330
Give me a smile.

364
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:35,170
Hurry up.

365
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
(Don't cross the line)

366
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,210
Quick, give me a smile.

367
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:40,690
Mister!

368
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,570
His foot... He stepped past the line.

369
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,050
Gao Zhan!

370
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,450
Xu Jingjing's letter

371
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:52,410
was for you!

372
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,170
Gao Zhan? Where is he?

373
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,529
Where is he?

374
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,529
Where?

375
00:15:59,369 --> 00:15:59,729
Isn't Gao Zhan

376
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,529
there in your heart?

377
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:03,690
I'll deal with you later.

378
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:05,729
You ran the red light.

379
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:06,489
It's the red light!

380
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,889
They're gone.

381
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,050
Why are you still here?

382
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:23,369
I'll stay and chat with you.

383
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:24,410
Tell me then.

384
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,009
What was all that nonsense

385
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:27,330
you told Ms. Chen
in the office yesterday?

386
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,330
Is your EQ really that low

387
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,170
or you're just dense?

388
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,810
Can't you see

389
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:31,769
I was trying to help you?

390
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,050
Were you helping when you made me

391
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:34,210
sound so pitiful?

392
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,489
If I hadn't said that,

393
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,889
your little fluttery feelings
for Gao Zhan

394
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,410
would be exposed.

395
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,769
Who likes Gao Zhan?

396
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,529
No, no way.

397
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:46,210
Definitely not.

398
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,849
Xu Jingjing.

399
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,930
I heard

400
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,489
everything you said

401
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,529
to Lu Xiaobai and Jiayao.

402
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,529
Even a bug has more depth than you.

403
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:53,849
What?

404
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:55,009
You're a freak!

405
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,249
How could you listen in
on other people's conversation?

406
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,489
If I didn't hear it,

407
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,330
I wouldn't have taken pity on you.

408
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:00,450
And I'd never

409
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:01,769
have tried to save you from Ms. Chen.

410
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:08,970
Kang Jiawei.

411
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,410
Don't you think

412
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,009
the person who found my letter

413
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,130
to be despicable?

414
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,049
How could they

415
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,249
leave it in someone else's desk?

416
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,930
Obviously they were making a fool of me.

417
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,289
So what then?

418
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,410
Find that person.

419
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,529
How?

420
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,780
(Yuming Senior High School)

421
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,540
(Grade 11 Class 3)

422
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:37,289
This class never behaves!

423
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,740
(Freedom and Fairness,
Intelligent and Innovative)

424
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:41,729
Is there so much to talk about?

425
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:47,850
Xu Jingjing.

426
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,809
Where's your report?

427
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,260
(Self-inspection, Xu Jingjing)

428
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,970
If you fail

429
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,809
to nip such bad practices

430
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,089
in the bud,

431
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,569
it will quickly manifest

432
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,690
into bigger problems.

433
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,009
Read it out.

434
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:24,850
Miss...

435
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,289
I hope you learned your lesson.

436
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,489
This is a reminder to the whole class.

437
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:30,769
I won't allow such things

438
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,610
to happen in the class again.

439
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,569
Read it.

440
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:43,769
Self-inspection.

441
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,529
Louder.

442
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,489
Self-inspection.

443
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,729
I... I shouldn't have...

444
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,529
Ms. Chen.

445
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:56,850
I don't think this is a good idea.

446
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:59,089
What's not good?

447
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:06,970
I mean,

448
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:08,930
with Xu Jingjing's level,
reading the report

449
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,529
is only going to hurt my ears.

450
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,009
Kang Jiawei.

451
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,289
I don't want to waste

452
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:14,529
the self-study time in the morning.

453
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,249
Do you think

454
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,410
you can say that to help her?

455
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,970
Ms. Chen.

456
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,289
I also think

457
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,529
it's inappropriate to read it out.

458
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:23,410
No matter what,

459
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,970
this is Xu Jingjing's personal matter.

460
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,289
It's her privacy.

461
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:27,970
Yeah.

462
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,970
Students are entitled
to their privacy too.

463
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,370
Miss.

464
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,489
I want to do my own revision.

465
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,329
I don't want to hear her report.

466
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,249
Yes.

467
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:35,569
That's right.

468
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:36,370
That's right.

469
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,289
I want to revise.

470
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,049
Let us study on our own.

471
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,089
Go back to your seat.

472
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,170
Study on your own.

473
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:52,729
Ms. Chen.

474
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:54,729
Sir.

475
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:56,809
I saw what happened.

476
00:19:58,769 --> 00:19:59,610
That's how students are.

477
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:01,610
Every time you take a step back,

478
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,210
they will advance one step.

479
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,650
The way you handled the situation

480
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,210
is precisely how

481
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,410
you fan their arrogance.

482
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,690
You didn't read the report

483
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,890
just because they were against it?

484
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,049
It's not that.

485
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,450
I think

486
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:17,210
it's a good thing they are
brave enough to stand up to me.

487
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:18,850
Besides, I'm unsure

488
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,930
whether my decision is right.

489
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:20,850
If you don't even know

490
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,370
right from wrong,

491
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,850
what are you doing being a teacher?

492
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,850
Both teachers and students

493
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,569
are getting worse by the year.

494
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,970
What are you looking at?

495
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,970
You don't know right from wrong.

496
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,450
You're unsuited to be a teacher!

497
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,809
A heartless person like you

498
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,729
will never understand!

499
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,729
Get rid of the problem?

500
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,170
Looks like you're the actual problem.

501
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,410
You're the toxic bud!

502
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:50,610
Also, Mr. Zhang.

503
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,249
Could you please wash your hair?

504
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:53,850
Your hair stinks!

505
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:54,650
Don't you know?

506
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,610
You never consider

507
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:56,610
other people's feelings, do you?

508
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:57,809
That's right.

509
00:20:59,009 --> 00:20:59,769
You noticed it too?

510
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:05,809
Have you been here the whole time?

511
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,450
Yes.

512
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,809
How could you eavesdrop on me?

513
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:11,009
I wasn't eavesdropping.

514
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,089
You were shouting so loudly.

515
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,450
But I agree with what you said.

516
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:18,930
Ms. Chen.

517
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,049
So what do you plan to do next?

518
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,130
What plan?

519
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:28,769
I think you should

520
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,970
stick to your guns about Mr. Zhang.

521
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,450
Don't be influenced by others.

522
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,410
I'm off.

523
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:56,970
Gao Zhan.

524
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,049
Thanks for speaking up for me

525
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,009
during morning class.

526
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:02,289
No need to thank me.

527
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,890
I just think

528
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,450
it's inappropriate
for Ms. Chen to do that.

529
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,329
Anything else?

530
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:13,569
Well...

531
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,370
I have a small favor to ask.

532
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:18,450
What is it?

533
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,690
Kang Jiawei and I

534
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,370
want to know

535
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,569
who it was

536
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:24,850
that left the letter in his desk.

537
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,809
Wasn't the letter for him?

538
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,529
No, I didn't write it.

539
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,089
Why would I admire him?

540
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,729
Then why admit it?

541
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:36,450
I...

542
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,850
It's complicated.

543
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:41,650
I'll explain to you

544
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:42,569
next time.

545
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,130
So can you help me find out

546
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:46,329
who's plotting against me?

547
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,569
Why ask me?

548
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:53,049
Because you're smart.

549
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:53,970
You were

550
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,970
reading a lot

551
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,970
on criminal investigation, right?

552
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:57,809
My interest in that has nothing

553
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,529
to do with your
little cat and mouse game.

554
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,970
Be it a big or small case,

555
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,970
it's an investigation nonetheless.

556
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:06,489
Sorry.

557
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,009
I can't help you with that.

558
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:16,769
Why did you have to look for him

559
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,210
to help you find the culprit?

560
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,130
You don't get it.

561
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,329
Listen.

562
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,650
A projector

563
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,450
went missing at the school last year.

564
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,210
Before the police even arrived,

565
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,970
he had caught the thief.

566
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,249
And

567
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:33,890
Gao Zhan is a fan

568
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:35,329
of mystery novels.

569
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,930
So?

570
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,690
Do you have an idea on how

571
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,410
to expose the culprit?

572
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:42,729
Who do you think

573
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,049
the biggest suspect is?

574
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,450
There can only be one truth.

575
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:48,610
The suspect

576
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,370
grabbed the letter when you fell

577
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,610
during the match.

578
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:53,569
They kept it in their own desk,

579
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,089
hoping to use the letter

580
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,130
as a way to gain fame.

581
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,569
So that person

582
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,850
is you, right, Kang Jiawei?

583
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:06,890
The case is solved.

584
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:09,089
You call that solving the case?

585
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:09,970
Solved?

586
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,009
Do I look so lame?

587
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:11,890
Yes.

588
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,370
There's a reason

589
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:16,089
why you two

590
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,049
are Xu Jingjing's friends.

591
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:21,690
So,

592
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:22,850
if my letter

593
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,850
fell somewhere

594
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,729
and the cleaning robot

595
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,529
at the basketball court swept it up.

596
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,729
That sounds plausible.

597
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,249
It's logical.

598
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,690
That solves it.

599
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,009
Are you guys idiots?

600
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:33,970
The cleaning robot

601
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,729
couldn't have swept

602
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,289
the letter into Kang Jiawei's desk.

603
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,249
Say,

604
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,769
could it be

605
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:40,529
that when Jingjing

606
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:41,529
lost her letter at the basketball court,

607
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,249
the doorman found it

608
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,289
when he was locking up.

609
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,489
You mean Mr. Ge?

610
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:47,890
Then why would he

611
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:49,049
leave it in Kang Jiawei's desk?

612
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,690
Because Mr. Ge knows us.

613
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,690
He saw the sign

614
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,970
and knew the letter
belonged to Jingjing.

615
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:54,210
He wanted to return it to her,

616
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,089
but,

617
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,130
he placed it in the wrong place.

618
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:57,170
Yes, yes.

619
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,249
Your two desks

620
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,130
are next to each other.

621
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,009
It's very possible.

622
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:02,329
I think you two

623
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,370
made some very great points.

624
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,890
It's solved!

625
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:08,729
Genius detective.

626
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:09,650
So smart.

627
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:14,970
Thanks, Mr. Ge.

628
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,410
Thanks, Mr. Ge.

629
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,049
You're welcome.

630
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:22,489
See?

631
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:24,170
I told you it wasn't Mr. Ge.

632
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,130
Now what?

633
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,370
We're out of leads.

634
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,769
You have to go back to the letter.

635
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,569
The culprit must have touched it.

636
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:36,610
So there has to be a trace.

637
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:37,850
Gao Zhan.

638
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,089
Are you going to help us?

639
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,249
The way you're investigating it,

640
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,089
I doubt you'll find anything.

641
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,049
Then, can you help us verify

642
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,170
the evidence this afternoon?

643
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,009
I won't be able to stay for too long.

644
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:49,850
Because

645
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:50,970
I have to send Xu Jingjing home.

646
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,650
I'm leaving if there's nothing else.

647
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,450
Gao Zhan is sending Xu Jingjing home?

648
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:04,569
Why would he do that?

649
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,249
What's going on between them?

650
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:07,850
I'd like to know too.

651
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,089
Why did he start sending her home

652
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:11,729
this semester?

653
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,650
Could it be...

654
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:15,489
No.

655
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:15,890
No way!

656
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:16,729
Definitely not!

657
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,690
A guy

658
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,809
is sending a girl home.

659
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,249
There's surely something.

660
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,970
Stop pointing that out, will you?

661
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:23,769
Can't you think of something positive?

662
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:25,650
Gao Zhan has agreed to help me.

663
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:26,650
Then today,

664
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:27,850
I'll be his Watson,

665
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:28,489
Yuanfang,

666
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,249
Ran Mori.

667
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:31,890
Do you have amnesia?

668
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,009
Did you forget

669
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:34,130
you have Mr. Zhang's tuition to attend?

670
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,210
Oh no!

671
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,249
Xu Jingjing.

672
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,049
This question isn't your enemy, is it?

673
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:51,809
You've been

674
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,130
staring at it for a long while.

675
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,210
Like a hated nemesis.

676
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,890
Shall I be the moderator for you two?

677
00:26:59,089 --> 00:26:59,970
What are you laughing about?

678
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:02,450
How many questions have you done?

679
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,650
Almost.

680
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,089
Almost done.

681
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,569
Mr. Zhang's after school tuition...

682
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:22,009
is concluding soon.

683
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:24,729
He usually goes back to the office

684
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,569
after 20 minutes.

685
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:28,450
Let's go.

686
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:36,890
What are you doing?

687
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:38,370
I'm climbing over.

688
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,690
The door is unlocked.

689
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,089
What now?

690
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,049
Don't leave your prints behind.

691
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:06,850
Where did you get the gloves?

692
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,489
From the lobster shop at the entrance.

693
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,489
That's all for today.

694
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,529
I have something to do.

695
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:15,089
Finish up the rest at home.

696
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:15,970
Submit them tomorrow.

697
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,809
Mr. Zhang!

698
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,529
Hold on.

699
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,489
I have one more question.

700
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,170
It will only take two minutes.

701
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,009
Please wait for me.

702
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,650
Wait two minutes?

703
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,370
You won't be able to finish

704
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,329
even with two hours.

705
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,489
You should go, Mr. Zhang.

706
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:24,890
Okay, hand it to me tomorrow morning.

707
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:25,370
Will do.

708
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,970
Ni Dapeng!

709
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:35,569
Oh no.

710
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,370
Xu Jingjing said the dean
is on his way back.

711
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,690
Hello, sir.

712
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,249
Mr. Zhang.

713
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:42,809
Hello.

714
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:47,729
Found it.

715
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:51,690
How is it?

716
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:53,610
Anything?

717
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,450
Mr. Zhang is almost back.

718
00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:58,410
Look here.

719
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:02,009
(Aside from being handsome, you're also smart.)
Gold powder.

720
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:07,489
If Xu Jingjing

721
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,569
didn't leave this behind,

722
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,370
then it belongs to the culprit.

723
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,450
The culprit held the letter like this.

724
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:14,089
The gold powder on the hand

725
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,450
got onto the letter.

726
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,130
Where did you go just now?

727
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:42,850
It's nothing.

728
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:44,970
You don't want to say?

729
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,170
It's okay.

730
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:50,569
I won't force you.

731
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,089
Gao Zhan.

732
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:57,450
There's something

733
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,729
I'd like to ask you.

734
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,809
Go ahead.

735
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:02,970
Why did you suddenly start

736
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:04,769
walking me home this semester?

737
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:08,850
I worry about you

738
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,130
walking home alone.

739
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,329
Well,

740
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,450
I have another question.

741
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,690
Just curious.

742
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,970
Don't think too much of it.

743
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,329
During the basketball match,

744
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,450
why did you choose

745
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,410
Xu Jingjing's drink

746
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,170
and not mine?

747
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:30,289
Because you bought Oolong tea.

748
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,529
You...

749
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,289
Xu Jingjing bought matcha.

750
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:34,610
I prefer that.

751
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,569
So you chose based on the drinks.

752
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:37,970
If not?

753
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:38,970
What else could I base it on?

754
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,650
Right.

755
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,170
You should choose what you like.

756
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,329
Anyway,

757
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,529
on Fridays,

758
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:45,690
you don't have to walk me home.

759
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,890
I can go home by myself.

760
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:48,289
How come?

761
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,569
Well,

762
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,370
I have something to do.

763
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:52,850
It's probably going to be late
when I finish.

764
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:55,130
That's fine.
I can wait as long as it takes.

765
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,729
Is there a problem?

766
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:04,890
Look at the top right corner.

767
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:06,610
Enlarge it and look properly.

768
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,890
(Aside from being handsome, you're also smart.)Do you see the gold powder?

769
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,170
(Aside from being handsome, you're also smart.)

770
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,049
(Aside from being handsome, you're also smart.)The shiny bit.

771
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:10,809
What's that?

772
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,370
I should be asking you.

773
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:14,970
Did you leave the powder behind?

774
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,650
No, I didn't.

775
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,729
I have no gold powder at home.

776
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:17,809
Then you're ruled out.

777
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,489
Only the culprit

778
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,450
could've left it.

779
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:22,650
But why would the culprit

780
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,930
have gold powder on their hand?

781
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:24,769
Anyway,

782
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,769
I have something to ask you.

783
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,450
What do Gao Zhan and Xu Jingjing

784
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,769
talk about every day

785
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,009
on the way home from school?

786
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,450
Do they share any interests?

787
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,329
Come in.

788
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,009
Mr. Zhang.

789
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,009
You wanted to see me?

790
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,610
Look at your test paper.

791
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,860
(Grade 11 Math Test Paper)

792
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:50,370
I actually got four questions right?

793
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,569
Don't you feel ashamed at all?

794
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,289
I heard you're the president
of the Taekwondo Club.

795
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,370
With your current condition,

796
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,049
I suggest you withdraw from the club.

797
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:06,210
Wait, Mr. Zhang.

798
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,410
These Math questions were...

799
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,329
I thought about it

800
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,210
yesterday at home.

801
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,009
It's not just Math.

802
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,170
You need help with many more subjects.

803
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,650
After-school hobby clubs aren't set up

804
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,890
for struggling students

805
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,529
like you.

806
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,089
I think you should halt

807
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,450
all activities unrelated
to your studies.

808
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,089
Fix your studying behavior first.

809
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,329
Mr. Zhang.

810
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,850
What about I lessen the time

811
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,049
I spend in the club?

812
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,410
As long as I can remain in it.

813
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,450
I'm notifying you.

814
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,650
Not bargaining with you.

815
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,210
Save your breath.

816
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,610
Cultural Lessons
are more important than clubs.

817
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,009
One moment you're writing love letters,

818
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:37,329
the next you're busy with clubs.

819
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:39,249
You care about everything but studying.

820
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:44,130
But I'm the president.

821
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,009
More reason to withdraw.

822
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,650
Who's going to take over then?

823
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,850
Disband it if there's no one.

824
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,089
I've looked into it.

825
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,210
Your club

826
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:53,410
doesn't even have ten members.

827
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,249
Mr. Zhang.

828
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,970
Strictly speaking,
clubs with less than ten members

829
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,729
should be disbanded.

830
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,529
It was really hard to get

831
00:32:58,769 --> 00:32:59,410
the Taekwondo Club running.

832
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,890
You can't disband it.

833
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:02,729
You only get two options.

834
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,049
One, you withdraw.

835
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,450
Two, disband it directly.

836
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:06,529
Of course,

837
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,930
when your results improve,

838
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:09,489
you're free to take part

839
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,329
in five or even ten clubs.

840
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,089
Sorry, Blackie.

841
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,089
I can no longer keep you company.

842
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,890
You've worked hard

843
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,529
over the past year.

844
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,529
Zhang Chang'an is ridiculous.

845
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:29,529
Just because he's the dean,

846
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,729
he thinks he can do anything

847
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,529
with the students?

848
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:34,370
I must be experiencing
a period of misfortune.

849
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,289
Good heavens!

850
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,089
Please spare me!

851
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,569
Did you find anything

852
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,970
about the letter?

853
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,049
I found

854
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:47,450
a bit of gold powder on the envelope.

855
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:48,970
I don't know what it is.

856
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:50,890
There's no more clues.

857
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,850
Gao Zhan didn't say anything either?

858
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,130
Forget it.

859
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,009
Our club doesn't have
enough members anyway.

860
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,529
I guess it's destined to disband.

861
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,569
President.

862
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,089
Don't be like that.

863
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:10,529
You're the founder

864
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,489
of the club.

865
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,370
Are you okay giving it up?

866
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:16,529
Of course not.

867
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,370
But what else can I do?

868
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:20,770
What about...

869
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:21,930
Jiayao and I take turns

870
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:22,890
to be the president?

871
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,730
That won't do.

872
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:26,450
Our basics is terrible.

873
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,009
How can we teach others?

874
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:30,410
Aren't there

875
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:32,129
any other skilled martial artists
in our school?

876
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,970
Dear God!

877
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,250
Please bless us with a Black Belt.

878
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:44,049
Black Belt?

879
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:48,009
Gao Zhan is a Black Belt.

880
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:51,089
Gao Zhan.

881
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,609
You didn't get a chicken thigh, right?

882
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:53,810
I got one specially for you.

883
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:55,529
It's okay, thanks.

884
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,049
Did you find anything
about the gold powder?

885
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,890
There's no progress.

886
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:14,370
I came to find you

887
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:15,730
because of something else.

888
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,410
Are you interested

889
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,770
to join the Taekwondo Club?

890
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,250
No.

891
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:23,930
Don't reject so fast.

892
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,209
Have a good think.

893
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,330
Still a no.

894
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,970
I'm already a Black Belt.

895
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,049
That's great.

896
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,209
The Taekwondo Club

897
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,009
is in need of

898
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:33,930
a Black Belt like you

899
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:34,649
to be the president.

900
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:36,930
Aren't you the president?

901
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,730
I have to go for tuition.

902
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,689
So I'm forced

903
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,890
to temporarily resign.

904
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,250
So may I ask you

905
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,370
to be our new president?

906
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:46,089
I'm sorry.

907
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,009
I have no interest in clubs.

908
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,049
But you're interested

909
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:49,730
in Taekwondo.

910
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,730
Moreover, the club

911
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,009
is serious in our training.

912
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,569
What?

913
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:56,970
You don't believe me?

914
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,410
I do.

915
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:00,129
You just don't believe me.

916
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:03,209
How long have you trained?

917
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:04,890
I started in kindergarten.

918
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:05,970
My dad taught me.

919
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:06,850
And,

920
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,450
he had wanted to go professional.

921
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,489
But he wasn't able to.

922
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,609
So he placed all his hopes

923
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,730
on me.

924
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:12,689
Listen.

925
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:13,609
When I started

926
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,689
the Taekwondo Club in the school,

927
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,770
my dad was so proud of me.

928
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:17,169
We never use training hours

929
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,370
to play games.

930
00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:20,009
We only focus on practice.

931
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:21,529
Got it.

932
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,089
I'm done. You take your time.

933
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,850
What about we have a match?

934
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,330
Are you serious?

935
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:43,209
Of course.

936
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:44,569
I'm also a Black Belt.

937
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,169
What about this?

938
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,609
If I lose,

939
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,890
I'll stop pestering you.

940
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:48,609
But,

941
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,970
if I win,

942
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,649
you'll be the new president.

943
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,209
What say you?

944
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:57,689
Chickened out?

945
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:00,770
No way.

946
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,450
I'll be waiting.

947
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,169
Okay, enough! My hands are numb.

948
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,489
How is it? Let me see.

949
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:19,930
See?

950
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,450
Your double chin

951
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,970
is visible from all angles.

952
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:24,330
And your nostrils.

953
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:25,850
No such thing.

954
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,009
But Gao Zhan is much taller
than Xiaobai.

955
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:28,850
And he's shortsighted.

956
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,169
He won't be able to see clearly.

957
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:31,649
What about this?

958
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,970
Will this angle be better?

959
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,770
Xu Jingjing.

960
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,649
Come to your senses!

961
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,370
You must not fight with Gao Zhan.

962
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,089
You're a lady.

963
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:41,569
You want Gao Zhan

964
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,649
to treat you like a lady,

965
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,089
don't you?

966
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,089
Lu Xiaobai.

967
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,489
Stop with the patriarchal thinking.

968
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,089
Why can't a girl fight?

969
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:47,970
Why must a girl

970
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:49,129
always be the weak party?

971
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,569
It doesn't matter.

972
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,970
I'm already like the clown

973
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,049
in Class 3 anyway.

974
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:54,089
No!

975
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:55,970
The embarrassing moments before

976
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:56,890
were at most

977
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,529
highlighting you as

978
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,250
a bold and carefree girl.

979
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,129
Just like...

980
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:04,730
Shancai.

981
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:05,970
Me?

982
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:06,890
Shancai.

983
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:08,049
But...

984
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:09,770
if you really

985
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:11,689
pick a straight-up fight with him,

986
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,330
then you won't be Shancai.

987
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:14,209
You'd just be...

988
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:15,250
Bruce Lee.

989
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,370
Wong Fei Hung.

990
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,370
Dwayne Johnson.

991
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:21,850
I've decided.

992
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,049
I won't fight.

993
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:24,890
I can't let Gao Zhan think

994
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,970
I was Dwayne Johnson.

995
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,609
If Gao Zhan actually thought

996
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:28,370
you were Dwayne Johnson

997
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,890
if you could beat him,

998
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:30,970
then he isn't

999
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:32,089
deserving of your admiration.

1000
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,129
What are you doing here?

1001
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:36,609
I think Gao Zhan

1002
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,450
is quite straightforward.

1003
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,049
To him, a match is a match.

1004
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:41,529
Thinking about

1005
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:42,410
all these nonsense

1006
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,209
is disrespecting him.

1007
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:45,410
Because in his head,

1008
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,089
there is no you.

1009
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:48,370
He only cares about how to beat you.

1010
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,970
Really?

1011
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,689
I'm sure Gao Zhan

1012
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,569
will change his mind about you

1013
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,209
if you manage to beat him.

1014
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:57,649
By the way,

1015
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,450
don't forget to wash your feet
before the match.

1016
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,930
Better not affect the opponent

1017
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:02,609
with the stench.

1018
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:03,569
That would be disastrous.

1019
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:05,450
Stop her!

1020
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:06,410
Hold her back!

1021
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:07,569
Whose feet stink?

1022
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:08,410
You touched me.

1023
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:09,250
Whose feet stink?

1024
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:09,930
Go on and smell it!

1025
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,049
Get over here.

1026
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:15,890
Calm down.

1027
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,489
Stop holding me back.

1028
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:18,209
Let me kick him to the moon!

1029
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,209
Get over here.

1030
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,580
♪Suddenly♪

1031
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,860
♪I'm stuck at the crossroad,
not knowing where to go♪

1032
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,900
♪With a heavy heart♪

1033
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,930
Take it and drink it.

1034
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,450
It's fine, really.

1035
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:42,569
It's okay.

1036
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,169
Whose feet stink?

1037
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:44,609
The smell...

1038
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,209
Stinks.

1039
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,290
It stinks? Go on and smell it.

1040
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:50,850
No way.

1041
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:51,810
That's impossible.

1042
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,330
It can't be.

1043
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:54,330
It has to be a coincidence.

1044
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,370
How could it be?

1045
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:56,970
It can't be her.

1046
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,290
It cannot be her.

1047
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,290
Dinner's ready.

1048
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:01,970
Coming.

1049
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,129
Meat!

1050
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,049
They're all your favorites.

1051
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,529
How is the new school?

1052
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:19,330
Are you settling in?

1053
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:20,370
Not too bad.

1054
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,049
Dad.

1055
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,970
Finally, we're back in Wuxi.

1056
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:25,689
How long is the hotel project
going to be

1057
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,450
this time?

1058
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:29,489
At least two years.

1059
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,930
You've had to move around with me

1060
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:33,730
the past few years.

1061
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:35,370
It must have been tough.

1062
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,890
Tough? No.

1063
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:37,850
No such thing.

1064
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:39,810
Dad.

1065
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:41,129
I think

1066
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,330
it's pretty fun

1067
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,609
to go to different cities

1068
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:44,330
and make new friends.

1069
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,169
That's why

1070
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:46,770
I bought this house.

1071
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,049
It's so that I could

1072
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,649
get more local projects.

1073
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,569
This way,

1074
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:51,689
you won't have to keep wandering.

1075
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:56,810
My parcel.

1076
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:00,810
Thank you.

1077
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,009
Are you not going to eat?

1078
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,049
I'm full!

1079
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,129
What...

1080
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:29,770
Energy drink.

1081
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,209
It boosts minerals.

1082
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:35,370
Thanks.

1083
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:41,770
How is your preparation?

1084
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:42,850
Your match

1085
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,850
against Gao Zhan is this afternoon.

1086
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,609
I'll leave it to destiny.

1087
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,089
Let me ask you a question.

1088
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:51,930
Are you...

1089
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:56,290
Washed-up Artiste?

1090
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,689
Do you use Douban?

1091
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:01,609
No, I don't.

1092
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,689
I only use Weibo.

1093
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:05,689
Then have you used Douban

1094
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,770
to join a group,

1095
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,930
"Why Am I Worthless?"

1096
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,970
Why would I join a group like that?

1097
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,649
Why would I ever do that?

1098
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,450
What makes you think

1099
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:16,609
I'd be a part of that?

1100
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:18,209
Okay, alright. Forget it.

1101
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:19,569
What is it?

1102
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,290
Are you saying I'm worthless?

1103
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,970
No, I didn't mean it like that.

1104
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,049
Then what is it

1105
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:24,850
about a "washed-up artiste"?

1106
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:28,569
No, never mind.

1107
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,529
It's nothing.

1108
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,290
What...

1109
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,209
are you doing?

1110
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:33,850
Continue reading.

1111
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:34,489
It's nothing.

1112
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,529
What the heck?

1113
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:44,930
Come one, come all!

1114
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,129
Jingjing versus Gao Zhan.

1115
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:46,890
The clown versus the ace.

1116
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:47,850
King Kong versus the school hunk.

1117
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:48,730
It's the match of the century!

1118
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,529
Any bets?

1119
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,089
Place your bets.
Minimum is a packet of Spicy Bar.

1120
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,009
No upper limit.

1121
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:52,970
Place your bets.

1122
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,009
Me!

1123
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:54,890
Gao Zhan will win.

1124
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:56,129
Five packets of spicy bar.

1125
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:56,850
Ren Keke.

1126
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:57,730
Five Spicy Bars.

1127
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,129
Five Spicy Bars.

1128
00:42:58,169 --> 00:42:59,009
Jot it down. A bet for Gao Zhan.

1129
00:42:59,290 --> 00:42:59,730
Three packets of Lays.

1130
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,649
Gao Zhan will sweep.

1131
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:01,169
Two packets...

1132
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,730
No, four packets! Zhang Junya.

1133
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,410
Bold move.

1134
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:04,450
Okay, jot it down.

1135
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:05,609
Four packets for Zhang Junya.

1136
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,569
Come on, guys.

1137
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:07,649
Anyone else wants to place bets?

1138
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,410
Don't miss the chance.

1139
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,569
Time waits for no one.

1140
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,970
I'll take you back once I finish.

1141
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,569
It won't take very long.

1142
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:15,930
Maybe

1143
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,169
we should forget it today.

1144
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:17,850
No.

1145
00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:19,209
I'll take you home.

1146
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,169
Wait for me.

1147
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,569
I'll add on two lollipops.

1148
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,290
Relax.

1149
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:26,730
Just like Kang Jiawei said,

1150
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:28,009
you have to show

1151
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:29,049
Gao Zhan what you're made of.

1152
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:30,450
I'm betting on you.

1153
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:31,330
My idol's signed photo

1154
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,129
is on the line.

1155
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:33,370
Don't make me lose it.

1156
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:34,290
Don't worry.

1157
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,330
I'm too happy!

1158
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,209
Focus.

1159
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,290
Do your best.

1160
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:57,810
She knows a thing or two.

1161
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,410
Could it be he got scared

1162
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:05,370
by the King Kong Barbie?

1163
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:08,370
It's gone!

1164
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:09,930
It's gone!

1165
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:11,009
It's gone!

1166
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:12,089
What's gone?

1167
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,609
Gone?

1168
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,209
What's gone?

1169
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:13,850
Who's gone?
