(Wang Jiayao: Kang Jiawei,
did Xu Jingjing contact you?)

Kang Jiawei.

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,680
Did Xu Jingjing contact you?

19
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:51,920
No.

20
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:52,920
What's wrong?

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,600
She went missing

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
and switched off her phone.

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,200
First,

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
we can use optoelectronic devices...

25
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,680
Hey, where are you going?

26
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,600
Kang Jiawei?

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,399
How do you know I'm here?

3rd of August.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,040
Today, I was

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,040
called by Zhang Chang'an again.

31
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,480
It wasn't my fault

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,799
but it's no longer important.

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,679
I'm going to catch

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,359
every doll at Tom's World today.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,880
You memorised all of

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,079
my Weibo posts?

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,359
Almost.

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,679
Just to be clear,

39
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,160
I don't feel like going home right now.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm not here

41
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,480
to bring you back home.

42
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,959
Since you get to come out,

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,280
let's have fun today.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,559
Come.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,880
Which doll do you like?

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll get it for you.

47
00:02:59,399 --> 00:02:59,959
That one.

48
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,480
Which one?

49
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,679
The dog.

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,440
Everyone likes the pink rabbit

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,399
but you like the dog?

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,519
It's so ugly!

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,480
I like the dog.

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,959
Look how pitiful it is

55
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,880
getting crushed by the rabbit.

56
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,480
Save it.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,799
All right.

58
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,720
Dog rescue operation begins!

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,280
Hurry up! Keep going!

60
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,280
Sorry.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
I couldn't

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,679
rescue the dog for you.

63
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,600
I didn't expect

64
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,959
you to lose to a rabbit.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
Dad,

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,280
I want to eat watermelon.

67
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:47,760
Come. I'll buy it for you.

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,320
I want to eat it too.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,320
Wait here.

70
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,280
Eat slowly.

71
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,160
No one will snatch it away.

72
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:22,920
During the summer holidays

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,280
when I was young,

74
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,600
my father would buy me watermelon

75
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,480
when I finished practising Taekwondo.

76
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,799
It was frozen and
we sliced it up and ate it.

77
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,280
It was so refreshing.

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,879
But this summer holiday

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,679
will definitely be

80
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,520
the worst summer holiday in my life.

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,160
Why?

82
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,040
I haven't reconciled with my father yet.

83
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,679
I've suffered enough

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
by learning how to draw every day.

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,199
I still have to work every day now.

86
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:51,799
I am so sleepy

87
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
that it's hard to keep my eyes open.

88
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:55,840
Aren't you

89
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,199
able to see Gao Zhan every day?

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,400
Yes.

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm supposed to

92
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:00,920
feel happy

93
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,040
and motivated

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
because I can see him every day.

95
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,239
But why can't I

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,679
cheer up right now?

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,999
This should also be

98
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,359
my worst summer holiday.

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,879
Forget it.

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,319
Can't you

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
see Xu Jingjing every day as well?

102
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,080
You even ate, studied

103
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
and went to karaoke together.

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
I lied.

105
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,239
It's because you were always

106
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,640
having fun, eating

107
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,480
and dancing with Gao Zhan.

108
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,080
I didn't want to lose to you.

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
I lied too.

110
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,920
It was staged.

111
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Staged?

112
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,439
I heard you saying

113
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,319
you were going to eat with Xu Jingjing.

114
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,160
I didn't want to lose to you too.

115
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,960
The silhouette with the flower

116
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,640
was also staged?

117
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,359
Am I amazing?

118
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,759
I'm impressed with myself.

119
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,600
Let me tell you.

120
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,199
That was

121
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,679
an old man and an old woman.

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,640
The old woman was
holding a stalk of green onions.

123
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,400
Both of them thought

124
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
I wanted to steal the green onions.

125
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,600
You are mad.

126
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,199
Do you think

127
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,199
Xu Jingjing knows about this?

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,679
I already told her.

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,999
What did she say?

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm sure

131
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,319
she doesn't want to see both of us now.

132
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,119
I don't get it.

133
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,080
Why did she copy my Weibo posts?

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,999
Today, I kept

135
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,239
scrolling her Douban.

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,480
I could feel that she was confused.

137
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,080
I felt that too.

138
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,960
It felt like us previously.

139
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,160
I'm still

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
in a confused state though.

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Xu Jingjing.

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
Yesterday, I actually wanted to...

143
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,840
What is this?

144
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,920
It's nothing.

145
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,840
It's just a normal toy.

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,679
Did Gao Zhan give it to you?

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,280
Do you know

148
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:31,960
why you think

149
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,999
this summer holiday is bad?

150
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,559
Because you didn't have fun with me.

151
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,400
It was all because

152
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
you didn't contact me.

153
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,759
You neglected me.

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,359
I didn't.

155
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
You are more focused on another guy.

156
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,960
I'll hit you if you continue.

157
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,199
Nice to meet you.

158
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,720
What's the meaning of this?

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Give-up Virtuoso.

160
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,879
We've finally met.

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,799
Nice to meet you.

162
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,600
Mayonnaise with Rice.

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,640
Jingjing.

164
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,640
I saw a dancing event.

165
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,079
I think it suits you.

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
(I Sing, You Dance)

167
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,120
Xu Jingjing.

168
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,079
Don't worry.

169
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,120
I will be honest with Xu Jingjing.

170
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,199
You've misunderstood.

171
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,880
I don't blame you.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Xu Jingjing

173
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,199
doesn't blame you as well.

174
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,319
Xu Jingjing found out?

175
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,199
She is more worried about

176
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,679
why you didn't reply to her message.

177
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,439
Did Xu Jingjing not

178
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,319
say anything else?

179
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,199
No.

180
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,439
She hopes

181
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,760
you can participate in the event.

182
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,120
I hope so too.

183
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,839
You'll participate, right?

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
Sorry. I have no time.

185
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:38,679
Isn't this

186
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,959
the opportunity you've been waiting for?

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,799
To do what you want.

188
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,240
What I want to do
is do the summer holiday homework.

189
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,559
It's the same

190
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,240
whether you do it or not.

191
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:45,880
I told you.

192
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,280
I have no time for that.

193
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,559
You probably

194
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:49,799
don't have the courage to be yourself.

195
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:53,719
Xu Jingjing.

196
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,120
Do you

197
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,160
not like yourself?

198
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:00,959
I used to be like that.

199
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,959
But I realised

200
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,880
accepting myself was a lot easier

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,959
than forcing myself.

202
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:08,400
Do the things you are good at

203
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,959
and you will slowly like who you are.

204
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,760
Do the things you are good at

205
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520
and you will slowly like who you are.

206
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:41,280
Alice, The Loneliest Whale.

207
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,120
Tell me.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,839
Should I go?

209
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,599
Do you think Alice, The Loneliest Whale,

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,479
will be here?

211
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,040
She has had no updates for a long time.

212
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,120
Did she quit?

213
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,799
No way.

214
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,160
I came here just for her.

215
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,920
Exactly.

216
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,280
She hasn't

217
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,520
replied to your message yet?

218
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:10,160
I didn't even go to work today

219
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,199
just to come here and cheer for her.

220
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:13,559
The event

221
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,920
will end soon.

222
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,679
She won't be coming, right?

223
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,839
It's all your fault!

224
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,719
I'm sure

225
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,160
you angered her yesterday.

226
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,439
You told me she didn't reply

227
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,479
to your messages

228
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,719
so I went to ask her in person.

229
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,240
I was trying to motivate her.

230
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,559
Motivate her?

231
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,199
Didn't you say

232
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:27,920
she doesn't want

233
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:28,920
to see us both?

234
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,679
You still told her we are here.

235
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
It will be a miracle for her to be here.

236
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,199
How can you blame me for that?

237
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,479
I did it out of kindness.

238
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,439
Xu Jingjing.

239
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,280
You...

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,559
Kang Jiawei.

241
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,000
Jingjing.

242
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,439
I knew you would come.

243
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,640
Xu Jingjing.

244
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,479
I have something

245
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,160
to tell you alone.

246
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,599
Is that possible?

247
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,559
I am here

248
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,679
to apologise to you.

249
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,319
Kang Jiawei said

250
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
you knew about that thing.

251
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,280
Sorry.

252
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,240
Jingjing.

253
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:02,000
This is not the time

254
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,160
to talk about that.

255
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,040
Right now,

256
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
you should prepare for the dance.

257
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:06,479
I'm really not angry.

258
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,040
I'm not here to dance.

259
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,719
I'm here to apologise to you.

260
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
Actually, I wanted to cancel

261
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,160
the account

262
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,360
but there are many things

263
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,599
I want to keep.

264
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,719
Also, I'm returning this to you.

265
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,799
You came to find me

266
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,520
just to say that?

267
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,199
Xu Jingjing.

268
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,640
Think about it.

269
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,079
Will you regret it

270
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,520
if you miss this opportunity?

271
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
I want to dance

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,160
but I don't think I'm good enough.

273
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,559
Why do you think that?

274
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,479
Look. Many of them

275
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
are your fans.

276
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,000
I also heard them

277
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,760
talking about you.

278
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,280
They are looking forward to seeing you.

279
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,000
But they don't know

280
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,079
that I'm a fake

281
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:46,888
and a thief.

282
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,000
You are not.

283
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,559
I don't care.

284
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,479
I don't care about the Douban incident.

285
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,400
On the contrary,

286
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,760
if you don't dance because of this,

287
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,199
it'll be my biggest regret.

288
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,920
So cool.

289
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,280
Are you done talking?

290
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,520
The event is ending soon.

291
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,719
Where's Xu Jingjing?

292
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,040
It's Alice, The Loneliest Whale!

293
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:25,880
Gosh, it's true!

294
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,679
Alice!

295
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,439
Alice!

296
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:36,760
How did you persuade her?

297
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,079
It's a girl's secret.

298
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,280
You don't need to know.

299
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,040
Alice!

300
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,199
Alice is so pretty!

301
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,041
Alice, The Loneliest Whale!

302
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,760
Alice!

303
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,040
Alice!

304
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:35,240
Thank you.

305
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,160
It's nothing. You're welcome.

306
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,160
Jingjing.

307
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:39,327
You were amazing.

308
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,319
You are also the best

309
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,400
who dances last.

310
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,240
Thanks to both of you.

311
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,280
You're welcome.

312
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,760
Ms. Whale.

313
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160
I want a picture too.

314
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:49,079
Sure.

315
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,160
- Mr. Zhang?
- Mr. Zhang?

316
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,439
Dad.

317
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,400
Eat.

318
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not eating.

319
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,360
You eat, Huanhuan.

320
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,799
Huanhuan was ill when she was young

321
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:34,920
so she couldn't go to school normally

322
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,959
like all of you.

323
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:37,880
But a while ago,

324
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,559
she got hooked on hip-hop.

325
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,319
She has been watching videos

326
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,400
of a girl with a whale helmet

327
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,640
on the internet.

328
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
I didn't expect you to be the girl.

329
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,479
I...

330
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,679
I like...

331
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,679
Ms. Whale!

332
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
Let me do it.

333
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:58,920
Sorry.

334
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,360
It's all right. Let me do it.

335
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
Sorry, Waitress.

336
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,400
Ice cream!

337
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,160
All right. Waitress.

338
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,319
Get me another cup.

339
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,959
Eat mine, Huanhuan.

340
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,839
Mine is delicious.

341
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,319
I'm eating Ms. Whale's...

342
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,679
This is really embarrassing.

343
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,799
It's all right, Mr. Zhang.

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,760
We have many dance videos.

345
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,760
I'll arrange them
and send them to you later.

346
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:40,920
Jingjing.

347
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,319
Congratulations.

348
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,120
I heard you joined the advanced class.

349
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,679
I even said

350
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,319
you were cheating back then.

351
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,719
I underestimated you.

352
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Can you forgive me?

353
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,719
The camera on my table

354
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,120
was not...

355
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,360
It was not to monitor the students.

356
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,039
When I get off work late,

357
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,840
Huanhuan will miss me.

358
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,199
I will turn on the camera

359
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,320
so she can see me.

360
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,120
Mr. Zhang.

361
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:29,519
Sorry.

362
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,439
I really didn't know.

363
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,759
Back then, you didn't say...

364
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,920
I...

365
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,199
Forget it. It's already in the past.

366
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,239
Huanhuan is very happy today.

367
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,519
It's all thanks to you.

368
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,439
All of you

369
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,479
should go home early.

370
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,560
You'll be in Grade 12 next semester.

371
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,719
You must not slack during this holiday.

372
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,679
During the first week,
all of you will be learning...

373
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,600
I should stop.

374
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,320
Come.

375
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,759
Dad.

376
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,279
Let me feed you.

377
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,519
Here. Let me feed you.

378
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,239
Blow it.

379
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,360
Here.

380
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,600
Slowly.

381
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,400
I am surprised

382
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,880
by Mr. Zhang's

383
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:30,880
family situation.

384
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,239
Also, he must have

385
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,360
brought Huanhuan

386
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,199
to the event to make her happy.

387
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,039
He did a lot of research.

388
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,959
Actually,

389
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,239
I'm starting to understand him now.

390
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,999
He was

391
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,279
strict with us

392
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
because he wanted

393
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,479
her daughter to be better.

394
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,080
He put his hopes in Huanhuan

395
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,920
onto us.

396
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,640
Also, we didn't feel grateful

397
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,039
about our health.

398
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,199
He probably thought

399
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,199
we wasted

400
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,759
the luck God gave us.

401
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,800
I regret talking back to him previously.

402
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,959
Actually, I feel slight regret too.

403
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:06,999
Do you think

404
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,959
Mr. Zhang will still come back?

405
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
I heard

406
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,800
he has resigned.

407
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,360
But I think Mr. Zhang

408
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,160
doesn't forget

409
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
the fact that he is a teacher.

410
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,160
Oh,

411
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,719
are you both hungry?

412
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,080
I'm starving.

413
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,439
Me too.

414
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Both of you should eat.

415
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:33,640
What about you?

416
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,120
I'm controlling my calories.

417
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:36,959
Go and eat.

418
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,640
Let's go.

419
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,360
Let's go.

420
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,239
Come.

421
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,320
Do you really not care?

422
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,999
About the Douban incident?

423
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,120
To be honest,

424
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,439
I care about it slightly.

425
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
I knew it.

426
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,999
You won't forgive me

427
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,560
for something like that

428
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,640
no matter how I apologise.

429
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,239
No.

430
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,199
Don't misunderstand.

431
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm not angry.

432
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm just curious

433
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
about your reason for doing that.

434
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,439
Because I want to be like you.

435
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,560
Be like me?

436
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,439
As popular as you.

437
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,360
Don't tease me.

438
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,759
Are you not popular enough?

439
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,679
You are Yuming's goddess.

440
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,360
Goddess.

441
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,679
I don't like it at all

442
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,120
when people see me as their goddess.

443
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,719
Are you flaunting?

444
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,560
No.

445
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,439
They see me as their goddess

446
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,279
because they feel distant from me.

447
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,199
But I just want to have

448
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,360
many sincere friends like you.

449
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,439
I don't know if you realised this.

450
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,479
Actually,

451
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,920
I don't have any friends.

452
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,279
Xu Jingjing.

453
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:18,840
You are like

454
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,320
the pickled mustard greens in this dish.

455
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,439
Are you sure you are not saying

456
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,679
that I'm only worthy as a side dish?

457
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,279
Everyone might think

458
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,679
the fish is
the main character of this dish.

459
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,880
But if you ask

460
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,320
the people who love this dish,

461
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,600
all of them actually
love pickled mustard greens instead.

462
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,279
All of them will order this dish

463
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,320
because of the pickled mustard greens.

464
00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:41,880
You are exaggerating.

465
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,600
But this is the truth.

466
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
In a war between fish
and pickled mustard greens,

467
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,560
the fish has never won.

468
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,920
Just like me and you.

469
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,600
Me and you?

470
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:56,719
Forget it.

471
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,679
You would've won with your name alone.

472
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,600
Even though

473
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,560
our names are similar,

474
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,840
your Xu Jingjing

475
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,120
sounds more elegant

476
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,920
that my Xu Jingjing.

477
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:05,880
Besides,

478
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,880
you are pretty,

479
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,999
and you are good at studies and dancing.

480
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
Pickled mustard greens like us

481
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,679
aren't even worthy to envy you.

482
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,519
Do you remember

483
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:19,039
the Original Sin I told you?

484
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,840
Your second Original Sin

485
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
is being cute.

486
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,560
In this world,

487
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,880
being excellent can't beat being cute.

488
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:31,959
Xu Jingjing.

489
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,360
I won't allow you to say that.

490
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,880
Excellence is also a kind of cuteness.

491
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,400
There are many kinds of cuteness.

492
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,719
Dapeng is cute too.

493
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,120
He is being silly every day.

494
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,439
Xiaobai is cute too.

495
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,920
She is always by my side

496
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,320
unconditionally.

497
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,479
Gao Zhan too.

498
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,800
Gao Zhan is also quite cute.

499
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,840
He doesn't even know

500
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:51,959
what a girl thinks.

501
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:52,880
Also...

502
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,239
There's more.

503
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,999
The sky is cute too.

504
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,759
It's high and blue.

505
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,120
The land is cute too.

506
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,920
It's vast and firm.

507
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,679
Right?

508
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,039
There's more.

509
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,560
A puppy is cute.

510
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,959
Green colour is cute.

511
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,479
So,

512
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,279
if pickled mustard green is cute,

513
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,439
the fish

514
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,840
is also cute.

515
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:21,920
Xu Jingjing.

516
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,800
Do you know

517
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:24,640
how many people

518
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,959
in the mall liked you today?

519
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,360
Do you know how many people
went there because of you?

520
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,679
Their applause was for you.

521
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,679
So,

522
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,920
you are the cutest

523
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,840
only when you are

524
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,560
doing the things you like

525
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
and be yourself.

526
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,160
Is that true?

527
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,360
Of course?

528
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,560
You were so charming

529
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,959
when you were dancing.

530
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,479
Xu Jingjing.

531
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:50,719
Promise me.

532
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,320
Forget all your unhappiness.

533
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,320
Just remember the applause

534
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,400
and cheers today.

535
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,640
All right?

536
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,120
Go home.

537
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,239
Xu Jingjing.

538
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,080
Can I keep the

539
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,439
Give-up Virtuoso account?

540
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,279
I know it is a part of my dark history.

541
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,199
Regardless, it is still my history.

542
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,519
If I want to be myself,

543
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,080
I need to start

544
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,360
by accepting myself from yesterday.

545
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,199
If I want to be myself, I need to...

546
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,880
Wait, let me memorise this.

547
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,640
This is a wonderful quote.

548
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,679
Thank you for today.

549
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,239
You're welcome.

550
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,600
You have been saying it on our way back.

551
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,840
I'm being sincere.

552
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,279
If both of us

553
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,679
keep talking,

554
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:47,800
we'll probably end

555
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:48,719
with a hug

556
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,600
like in the dramas.

557
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,759
No way.

558
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,759
I'm going home.

559
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,880
Go back.

560
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,239
Bye.

561
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,120
Xu Jingjing.

562
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:18,999
Both of you

563
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,080
had quite the chat.

564
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,439
Didn't you go home?

565
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,080
No.

566
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,800
I thought

567
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,120
it wasn't right

568
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,959
to join in your conversation.

569
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,080
However,

570
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,840
I can't go home

571
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,279
without knowing
what happens to you both.

572
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:31,999
Right?

573
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:33,120
Have you been

574
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,320
following us?

575
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,999
I didn't follow both of you.

576
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,320
I went to do

577
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,279
a very important thing just now.

578
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Oh.

579
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:40,479
How did

580
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,480
the chat go?

581
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,959
It was a success.

582
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,439
Both of you are really fine now?

583
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,519
What?

584
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,920
Do you want us

585
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
pulling each other's hair and fight?

586
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,519
It's good that you are fine.

587
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,759
Did she say

588
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:56,687
why she did that?

589
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:57,911
You don't need

590
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,279
to know the details

591
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,600
but from today onwards,

592
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,160
Xu Jingjing

593
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,239
will be different.

594
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,959
What important thing

595
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,519
did you go to do just now?

596
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,719
Dog!

597
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,439
Do you want it?

598
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,519
Sure.

599
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
However,

600
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,759
you need to be my domesticated elf

601
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,840
for another year in 12th Grade.

602
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,679
Kang Jiawei!

603
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,479
You want this?

604
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,679
Come and take it.

605
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,880
Check.

606
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,560
Block.

607
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,759
Check.

608
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,400
Pawn.

609
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,600
It scared me!

610
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:12,490
♪You will still arrive at the
lighthouse shining far away in the end♪

611
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,519
When school starts next week,

612
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,239
we can't sit together anymore.

613
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,039
Why?

614
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,279
Are you still planning to copy
my homework in Grade 12?

615
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,239
No way.

616
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,360
I'm free now.

617
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,800
I wonder who can stand

618
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,719
sitting beside you in science class.

619
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,279
A proud narcissist who talks a lot.

620
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,439
How annoying!

621
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,880
I'm the one who is free.

622
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,600
I can finally have some peace alone

623
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,719
since I no longer need

624
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,880
to solve questions for someone.

625
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:40,400
Then,

626
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,039
will you forget me

627
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,479
after you have a new deskmate?

628
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:50,120
Aren't you getting

629
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:50,959
a new deskmate too?

630
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,239
I will go to science class

631
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
and annoy you often.

632
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,679
I welcome you to come and annoy me.

633
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,640
It's late. Go home.

634
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:01,880
There's class tomorrow.

635
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,719
Kang Jiawei.

636
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:10,600
Thank you.

637
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,759
For that dog?

638
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,999
I got it after a few tries.

639
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,959
No need to thank me.

640
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,080
Who told you that you are not the lead?

641
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,640
Xu Jingjing, you are the lead.

642
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,640
You drew Pipi well.

643
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,439
You are great at Taekwondo.

644
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,640
You are witty, humorous,

645
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,840
kind and brave.

646
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,800
You are not ordinary at all.

647
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,600
Why do you have to care

648
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,719
about what people think of you?

649
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,600
Xu Jingjing, remember.

650
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,640
You will forever be

651
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,479
the real lead character

652
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,400
under the spotlight of your life.

653
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,840
Thank you

654
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,400
for making me into a better self.

655
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,039
Thank you

656
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,400
for making me into a more handsome self.

657
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,800
But you have to promise me

658
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,800
not to forget about me

659
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,360
after you have a new deskmate.

660
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,519
I won't forget you.

661
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,360
I can't hear you.

662
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,519
Kang Jiawei will never forget

663
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:44,479
Xu Jingjing!

664
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,519
Xu Jingjing will always be

665
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,479
Kang Jiawei's best friend!

666
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,320
Seems like my holiday

667
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,759
is not as bad as I expected.

668
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,400
She's still asleep?

669
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,920
Is she going to be late
on her first day in 12th Grade?

670
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,999
Are you...

671
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,679
What's wrong?

672
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,080
No. Well...

673
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,479
Breakfast is ready. Come and eat.

674
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,120
Okay.

675
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,239
Xu.

676
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:01,999
Hurry.

677
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,080
Pack Jingjing's breakfast.

678
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,959
She woke up early in the morning

679
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,800
just to draw.

680
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:06,719
Hurry up.

681
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,519
Of course, she has to draw.

682
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,439
After all, we are paying an expensive

683
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:09,800
drawing course fee.

684
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,320
Mom, I'm not eating.

685
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,199
I'm going out to eat.

686
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,160
Jingjing.

687
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,759
Oh.

688
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
I received my pay two days ago.

689
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,279
I already transferred the money to you.

690
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:23,840
Check your account

691
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,880
when you are free.

692
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,640
Also, thank you

693
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,279
for paying my fees for me.

694
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,199
I'll pay the rest

695
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,080
after I earn them.

696
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,840
Is that good enough?

697
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,999
Jingjing.

698
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,120
Jingjing.

699
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,679
I didn't ask her

700
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,439
for the money.

701
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,800
Enough. Just shut up.

702
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,410
(Yuming Senior High School)

703
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,199
Jingjing.

704
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,519
Are you looking for me?

705
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,479
I need to

706
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,959
ask you for a favour.

707
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,880
Sure.

708
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,320
There's a crack

709
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,880
on the helmet

710
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,320
and the colour on the side is faded.

711
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,439
I want you

712
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,239
to help me fix it.

713
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,160
Didn't you already decide

714
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,120
not to wear this anymore?

715
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,400
But

716
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,439
I think this helmet

717
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,840
means a lot to me.

718
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
I want to give it to Huanhuan.

719
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,999
I see.

720
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,039
When I fix it,

721
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,400
let's visit Huanhuan together.

722
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,400
Sure.

723
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,959
Actually, I kept thinking about Huanhuan

724
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
since we last met.

725
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,519
I think it's tough for Mr. Zhang.

726
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
I want to do something for him.

727
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,439
It's quite good

728
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,560
to give this to Huanhuan.

729
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,239
Both of you are quite free.

730
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:35,479
What are you planning

731
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,560
on the first day of school?

732
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,840
Miss Chen.

733
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,400
What?

734
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,840
I'll keep anything

735
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,840
unrelated to class.

736
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,560
No.

737
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,640
Listen to me.

738
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,880
Are you telling the truth?

739
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:56,719
Yes.

740
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,400
You can ask Kang Jiawei
if you don't believe us.

741
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,120
He met

742
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,160
Mr. Zhang with us.

743
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,679
How did that happen?

744
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,880
Miss Chen,

745
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,679
can you not confiscate this helmet

746
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,160
and let me fix it?

747
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,160
I approve.

748
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,199
However,

749
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,039
don't think about anything

750
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,239
unrelated to class.

751
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,759
Definitely!

752
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:19,560
Thank you, Miss Chen.

753
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,560
Thank you, Miss Chen.

754
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,920
Go back to class.

(Do Your Best
In The College Entrance Examination)

756
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,080
Sorry.

757
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,519
I didn't know Miss Tian

758
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,320
arranged for us

759
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,400
to sit beside each other.

760
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:40,982
If you don't want that,

761
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,800
I can talk to her

762
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:42,880
and ask her to put me in another seat.

763
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:43,920
It's fine.

764
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,640
It's not bad sitting beside each other.

(Student On Duty, Chen Yan)

766

Jingjing.

767
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,239
I'm sitting here?

768
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,080
Yes.

769
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:03,360
I told Miss Chen

770
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,439
that I want to sit beside you.

771
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,479
After Kang Jiawei left,

772
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,800
I can keep tutoring you.

773
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:10,880
Keep quiet.

774
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,159
Before class, I want to announce

775
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,079
the coming-of-age ceremony

776
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,760
for all 12th Grade students

777
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:18,400
that's happening two days later.

778
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,439
All of you and your parents

779
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,360
have to attend the ceremony.

780
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,479
I think

781
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,079
this is

782
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
a very important ceremony.

783
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,959
You can understand

784
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,639
the responsibility you are shouldering

785
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,400
and your rights.

786
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,519
So, I hope

787
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,119
everyone can use this opportunity

788
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,039
to prepare
what you want to say to your parents

789
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:33,680
and prepare

790
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,519
the coming-of-age present
for your classmates.

Let's begin

792
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,639
your 12th Grade journey

793
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,200
through an exchange with
your parents and your friends.

794
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,880
How do you feel when you see this?

795
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,800
Are you thinking of that song?

796
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,639
Where has the time gone?

797
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
All Grade 12th students.

798
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,439
For all of you,

799
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,959
the college entrance examination

800
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,040
is near

801
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,360
and imminent.

802
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,079
What do

803
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,119
281 days mean?

804
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:08,920
It means

805
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,959
281 times of pushing forward.

806
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,320
It means 281 times

807
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,680
working hard.

808
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,039
So, from now on,

809
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,039
every one of you
has to pull yourself together

810
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,240
and treat every exam

811
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,639
and every minute seriously.

812
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,439
Do you understand?

813
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,519
Yes.

814
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:26,720
Louder.

815
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,400
Yes!

816
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,479
Let's begin your exam.

817
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,980
(Lu Xun)

818
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,599
Over here!

819
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,800
Ace students.

820
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:47,880
How did you do in your exams?

821
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,200
Don't mention it.

822
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,439
I think

823
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:52,486
I screwed up badly.

824
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,519
Come on.

825
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,639
You said the same thing

826
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,519
during the last exam.

827
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm telling the truth.

828
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,439
I was only working and drawing

829
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,159
during the holidays.

830
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,039
I didn't even arrange

831
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,079
a schedule to study.

832
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,519
I have a feeling

833
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,240
that it's over for me.

834
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,240
Enough talk about this.

835
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,439
Let's talk about something happy.

836
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,039
Which of your family members

837
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
will be coming
to the coming-of-age ceremony?

838
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,240
Everyone from my family
says they are coming.

839
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,200
My parents

840
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:13,999
and my grandparents.

841
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,079
Dream on.

842
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,720
The school

843
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,959
only allows one parent to attend.

844
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,639
My family...

845
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,599
I think it should be my mother.

846
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,840
My relationship with my dad
is still bad.

847
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,039
It's still bad

848
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,079
after the summer holidays?

849
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,360
If he wants to cause problems for me,

850
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,360
I'll entertain him all day long.

851
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:31,840
Don't be angry.

852
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,439
What present do you want
for the ceremony?

853
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,280
I'll buy it for you.

854
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,320
An expensive one!

855
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,720
I'll give you another chance.

856
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,280
Say it again.

857
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,200
Actually, I don't want anything.

858
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:43,999
I just want to

859
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,400
forget about
the bad things with my father.

860
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,479
Xu.

861
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,840
Do you think Jingjing

862
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,599
is Picasso reborn?

863
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,999
This is not

864
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,720
Picasso's art style.

865
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,119
Look at this old guy.

866
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:05,959
It looks as if he's alive.

867
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,920
Stop calling him an old guy.

868
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,159
He is Voltaire.

869
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Do you know him?

870
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,280
You're so uncultured.

871
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,999
Will you admit

872
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,439
that our Jingjing is talented?

873
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,760
With her skills, she has already

874
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,959
reached this level

875
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,800
after two months.

876
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,559
She's a genius.

877
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:27,639
Our money didn't go to waste.

878
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,639
Will it kill you to admit it?

879
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,559
Did she really draw this?

880
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,720
Nonsense.

881
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,439
Do you think I drew it?

882
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,400
It was difficult for you
to draw your own eyebrows.

883
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,320
How could it be you?

884
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:45,119
However,

885
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,760
I think Jingjing

886
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:47,840
has my talents.

887
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,519
She is a quick learner.

888
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:50,880
Smart.

889
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:51,800
How wonderful.

890
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,920
You finally say something nice now.

891
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,200
Why do you always

892
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,039
say something bad

893
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,159
in front of Jingjing?

894
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:58,639
I couldn't find

895
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,840
a suitable opportunity.

896
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,439
Do you need an opportunity

897
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
to talk to your daughter?

898
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,959
There's an opportunity
in the next two days.

899
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,159
See if you can grasp it.

900
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,400
But my daughter wanted Great White.

901
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,200
Sir.

902
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,240
I really don't know

903
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,159
what is Great White.

904
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,281
Why don't you call and ask her?

905
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,360
Miss.

906
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,200
If I can make the call,

907
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,680
there's no need for me to ask you.

908
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,360
Oh.

909
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:39,720
Look at this.

910
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,039
My biggest takeaway
from learning how to draw.

911
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,999
Great White is the most important thing.

912
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,280
My daughter's school

913
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,559
has a coming-of-age ceremony.

914
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,559
I want to give her

915
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,599
a surprise.

916
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,240
So,

917
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:50,407
I want to give this "Great White"

918
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,039
to her as a gift.

919
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,800
You have to find out

920
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,200
what Great White is no matter what.

921
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,999
I'm in trouble.

922
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,039
Great White.

923
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,400
Is your daughter talking about this?

924
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,880
This?

925
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:03,800
Great White

926
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,320
is not written on this.

927
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,479
Is your daughter an art student?

928
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,240
Yes.

929
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,320
This is it.

930
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
Art students

931
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:10,760
use this a lot.

932
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,400
This is the Great White she meant.

933
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,760
This might be it.

934
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:14,880
All right. I'll take it.

935
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,280
How many do you need?

936
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,439
100 cans.

937
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:19,119
100 cans?

938
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:21,680
Sure.

939
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,599
Thank you.

940
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:25,999
Here.

941
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,200
You can only have one every day.

942
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:27,959
All right?

943
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,240
All right.

944
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,720
How much?

945
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,039
30 yuan.

946
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,079
Oh no. I forgot my wallet.

947
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,920
Let me pay for it.

948
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,479
Miss Chen?

949
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,800
It's done.

950
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:43,479
All right.

951
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:46,800
Huanhuan.

952
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,280
Ms. Whale.

953
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,999
Ms. Whale is giving it to you.

954
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,159
Do you like it?

955
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes.

956
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,999
Miss Chen, why are you...

957
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,800
The children are giving it to Huanhuan.

958
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:58,519
Xu Jingjing

959
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,519
even fixed it

960
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,599
and asked me to give it to her.

961
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:04,559
Mr. Zhang.

962
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:06,999
Actually, the students

963
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,200
no longer blame you.

964
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,039
A while ago, I heard Principal Shen

965
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,800
say Xu Jingjing
has gotten into the advanced class.

966
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,999
Seems like you are better than me
at teaching.

967
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,959
I'm not better.

968
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,680
She wanted to study

969
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,119
so she worked hard.

970
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,720
You did nothing and
got the desired result instead.

971
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
I used to think

972
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,280
a teacher should establish authority.

973
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,439
Students should be caned.

974
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,559
Seems like I'm the one getting old.

975
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,280
Don't say that.

976
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,079
Mr. Zhang.

977
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,439
I came here today

978
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,320
to discuss something with you.

979
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,479
This semester, Principal Shen

980
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,079
wants me to teach
the 12th Grade's advanced class.

981
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,559
I know

982
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,639
he wants to train me

983
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,840
but...

984
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,559
You are not confident?

985
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,880
I heard from other teachers

986
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:00,999
that the students you taught

987
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,959
all made it into top universities.

988
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,639
I want to learn from you.

989
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,800
Come back.

990
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,720
That's not right.

991
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,479
I discussed it with the principal.

992
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,959
He supports my idea.

993
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,999
Chen.

994
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,559
You said

995
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,240
you wanted the students

996
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,680
to gather with you,
share their problems with you

997
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:24,840
and remain friends

998
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,240
after graduation.

999
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,639
Do you think

1000
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,680
I can become

1001
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,840
a teacher like that?

1002
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,439
Of course.

1003
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,439
Mr. Zhang.

1004
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,159
Let's work together

1005
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,720
and send all our advanced class students

1006
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:40,920
to key universities.

1007
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,880
All right?

1008
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,479
Sure.

1009
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:49,439
You know this?

1010
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm keeping up with the times.

1011
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,999
Jingjing.

1012
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,559
Where is your mother?

1013
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,119
She can't come
because there's a big order

1014
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,760
in the milk tea shop.

1015
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:06,559
She asked my father to come.

1016
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:07,760
However,

1017
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,800
I don't think he will come.

1018
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,400
(Soar as an Adult)
Students and parents.

1019
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,439
Welcome to

1020
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,159
today's coming-of-age ceremony.

1021
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,720
First, I want all of you

1022
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:43,920
to welcome an old friend of ours.

1023
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,240
Mr. Zhang.

1024
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,130
(Soar as an Adult)

1025
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:54,439
From today onwards,

1026
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,599
he will return

1027
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,079
to his original post officially.

1028
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,559
Thank you, everyone.

1029
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,039
During the time when I was away,

1030
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,439
I thought about many things

1031
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,200
and reflected on many of them.

1032
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:15,519
If I did anything wrong

1033
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,039
in my work in the past,

1034
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,400
I hope all teachers and students

1035
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,639
can forgive me.

1036
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,559
In the coming year,

1037
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:23,752
I will do my best

1038
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:24,840
to assist Miss Chen

1039
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,079
and work hard together.

1040
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,959
I will do my best with everyone

1041
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,039
to overcome

1042
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,280
the college entrance examinations.

1043
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,599
Thank you, everyone.

1044
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,760
Our coming-of-age ceremony

1045
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,400
will officially begin.

1046
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,439
Every year, I'll lead the students

1047
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,559
to swear an oath.

1048
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:54,800
Every year, I feel emotional

1049
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,280
because I know

1050
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,959
every time I swear an oath,

1051
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,200
the world will have

1052
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:01,519
another batch

1053
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,800
of young adults
who can be responsible for themselves

1054
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,159
and

1055
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,599
walk towards the future courageously.

1056
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
I hope all of you swear the oath

1057
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,800
with me sincerely.

1058
