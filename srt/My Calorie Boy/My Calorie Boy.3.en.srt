(Muscle shirt and yellow rain boots)

16
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,980
(30 minutes before the Taekwondo battle)

17
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,359
It's so crowded here.

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,359
I bet they're here for Gao Zhan.

19
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,639
I heard

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,159
the students from
the class next door said that

21
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,359
that they think

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
it's adorable to see
Gao Zhan battling against Xu Jingjing.

23
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,600
Is that so?

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,480
They must be out of their mind.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,519
But how would Gao Zhan and Xu Jingjing

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,439
end up in a battle

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,480
out of the blue?

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,239
Xu Jingjing must have
pestered him to do it.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,920
Gao Zhan is also thoughtless.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,399
Everyone knows

31
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,079
that you're the closest person to him.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,639
Why is he mingling with

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,880
Xu Jingjing?

34
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,639
Well.

35
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,920
I have some other business.
I need to leave.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
What are you doing?

37
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:02,959
Kang Jiawei.

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Give me your camera.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,480
Give it to me, you scum!

40
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,760
Stop fighting.

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,720
Get up.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,480
Scum!

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,959
Give it to me.

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,880
I must let Gao Zhan

45
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,200
see you in a new light.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,600
I've bet

47
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,519
my idol's autograph

48
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,359
on your victory.

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,720
Please don't fail me.

50
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,000
I...

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,440
This is the first time

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,799
that my name

53
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,359
and Gao Zhan's name

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,679
are closely connected.

55
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:32,600
Hello.

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,600
What?

57
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,079
Where are you now?

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you alright, Kang Jiawei?

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,399
Kang Jiawei.

60
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:45,720
Are you feeling better now?

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,639
Kang Jiawei.

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,600
What should we do?

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,160
Do we need to call the ambulance?

64
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,160
How are you feeling?

65
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,720
You scare me, Kang Jiawei.

66
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:09,720
Didn't I tell you

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,160
to go with me?

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
How would I know?

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,999
I knew it.

70
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:16,920
Whenever I'm not around,

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,840
this person will show up.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,679
What do you mean?

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,600
Do you know him?

74
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
When the semester just started,

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,239
I noticed there's people

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,040
sneakily taking pictures

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,040
with a camera around
the school entrance.

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,280
I've observed them for a few days.

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,640
They should be after you.

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,879
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,400
I wasn't sure then.

82
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,359
I didn't want to scare you.

83
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,559
That's why

84
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,400
you insisted to send me home everyday.

85
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,520
Thank you.

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,840
You told me

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,400
that you have
other plans on Friday night.

88
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,199
So, I wouldn't need to see you home.

89
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,999
Turns out you were here to dance?

90
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,239
I don't want people to know

91
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,160
about this.

92
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,119
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,319
I wasted your good intentions.

94
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,439
It's my fault too.

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,439
I should have told you earlier.

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
So, you could be on guard.

97
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,480
He must have found out

98
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
where you dance.

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
And you're alone.

100
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,359
Hence, he dared to do this.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,999
By the way,

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,080
why didn't you both

103
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,480
call the police?

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,799
My mum prohibits me
from doing street dance.

105
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,199
If I call the police,
she'll know about this

106
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,439
and I might not
be able to dance anymore.

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,999
He's gone.

108
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,160
He's gone.

109
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,480
He's gone.

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,640
What's gone?

111
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,520
What's gone?

112
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,640
What's gone?

113
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,960
Gao Zhan is gone.

114
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,600
I've checked the fitting room.

115
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,520
He's really gone.

116
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,679
-He's gone.
-Has he ran away?

117
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
He's afraid of losing for sure.

118
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,400
He's afraid of losing
to that Queen Kong.

119
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,840
We'll be rich, Xiong.

120
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,960
Come on.

121
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,239
She's here.

122
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,359
A Queen Kong born in the storm.

123
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,439
I hereby announce

124
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,559
that the champion of the battle

125
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,280
Queen Kong Xu!

126
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,400
What did you say?

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,319
Stop!

128
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,439
Save me.

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,700
(Do not cross the line)

130
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,679
Are you hungry?

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,600
Here.

132
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,960
Try this on.

133
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
See if it fits you.

134
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,720
Thanks.

135
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,359
By the way,

136
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,199
the condiments of
this barbeque restaurant

137
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,000
are really delicious.

138
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:33,959
I'm a regular here.

139
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,280
You can try it later.

140
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,559
I can see

141
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
that you're a foodie.

142
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,040
I'll share with you

143
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,040
my DianPing account.

144
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,559
I've tried all the restaurants

145
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,079
around our school.

146
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,319
Here you go.

147
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,839
Order whatever you want.

148
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,559
Meal is on me.

149
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,920
You can make the order.

150
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,959
I...

151
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
I don't have much appetite.

152
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:58,839
Me too.

153
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,760
Let me share a secret trick with you.

154
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,959
Sprinkle some sugar and chilli powder

155
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,679
on top of mayonnaise.

156
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,160
That's a symphony between

157
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,839
sugar, fats, and protein.

158
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,439
Well.

159
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,559
How could you eat like this?

160
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,280
Incredible.

161
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,439
Fine.

162
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,799
Let's not talk about how you eat.

163
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,479
What's wrong with you?

164
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,280
I thought I'm fine now.

165
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,240
You're in this state.
How could you say that you're fine?

166
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:09,880
Be honest with me.

167
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,920
What exactly happened today?

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,040
You can see me off here.

169
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,439
My house is just around the corner.

170
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,199
If you're

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,920
going to dance again,

172
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,880
I can accompany you.

173
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,360
It's okay.

174
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,599
I don't plan

175
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,040
to dance in the near future.

176
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,400
I don't want to bother you.

177
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,439
I shall go home first.

178
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
Gao Zhan.

179
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,760
Thank you.

180
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,479
Never mind.

181
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,880
Gao Zhan

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,719
helped Xu Jingjing to hit a pervert.

183
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:50,640
That's why he didn't show up.

184
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,559
He didn't hit the pervert.

185
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,439
I hit the pervert.

186
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,319
You can't imagine

187
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,120
how brave I was.

188
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,799
I flung

189
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,559
my legs at him,

190
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,360
Then, I gave him
an over-the-shoulder arm drag

191
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,199
and flipped him over onto the ground.

192
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:57,760
I threw that guy...

193
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,799
Gao Zhan is really thoughtful.

194
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,319
He's concerned about her safety,

195
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,160
so he sees her back home everyday.

196
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,799
He was afraid that she might
be scared if she knows about it,

197
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,120
so he didn't let her know.

198
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,400
He just want to act heroic.

199
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,000
Where

200
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,280
is my hero then?

201
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm pitiful too.

202
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:12,839
I got stood up

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
in front of the whole school.

204
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,319
And I got ridiculed

205
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,679
due to a letter I wrote.

206
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,240
I think you're probably

207
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,199
the only person
who's more unlucky than me.

208
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,460
(Rich Daddy Restaurant)

209
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,959
Are you done?

210
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
My mood suddenly brightens up.

211
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,280
Let's go.

212
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,640
Can I have the bill, please?

213
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:46,599
Hold on.

214
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,160
Play ball with me, dad.

215
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:52,079
I'm busy.

216
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Play on your own.

217
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,040
The total is 186 yuan.

218
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,079
180 yuan will do.

219
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:58,640
Alright.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,079
You can scan the QR code here.

221
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,680
(Total: 186 yuan)

222
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,710
(Aside from being handsome, you're also clever.)

223
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,799
(Aside from being handsome, you're also clever.)
Gold powder.

224
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,240
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

225
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Nothing.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,559
Come on.

227
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,120
Oh no.

228
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,040
Are you okay?

229
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Do you feel better now?

230
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,040
Of course, I'm totally fine.

231
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm fine, how about you?

232
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,479
Don't be afraid.

233
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,719
I'll protect you next time.

234
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,559
Why is there a next time?

235
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm feeling better.

236
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
Thanks for your concern.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You should stop thinking
about what happened earlier.

238
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,880
Stop looking at them.
You'll only upset yourself.

239
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,000
What's the matter with Gao Zhan?

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,640
Shouldn't he

241
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,959
apologise to me?

242
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:03,920
By the way,

243
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,479
I found a new clue
regarding the letter incident.

244
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,479
Who did that?

245
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,160
Why do you take a pom pom?

246
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,679
The cheerleaders used it
during the basketball game.

247
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,719
I went to the stadium earlier

248
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
and took this out.

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,760
Look.

250
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,439
It's exactly the same as
the one in the letter.

251
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,280
The letter disappeared

252
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,559
after the basketball game.

253
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,439
It has gold powder on it.

254
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,400
The only thing
that can relate these together

255
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,479
is this.

256
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,520
Who used this

257
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,360
gold pom pom then?

258
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:49,439
Look.

259
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
The first one is Wei Xue.

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,959
Then, it's Li Huiya.

261
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:01,920
Xu Jingjing.

262
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,520
Xu Jingjing took

263
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,439
a gold pom pom too.

264
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,400
You're wrong.

265
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,679
Her was a silver pom pom.

266
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,479
I didn't see it wrongly.

267
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,479
Hers was gold in colour.

268
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,360
You're wrong.

269
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm not.

270
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,400
You must be wrong.

271
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,839
I'm not.

272
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,040
It must be Xu Jingjing.

273
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,120
You're siding with her.

274
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not.

275
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:17,959
You do.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,760
How can you be so sure

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,479
that it's Xu Jingjing then?

278
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,079
Because...

279
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,199
Because this is her usual tactics.

280
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,000
(Children Talent Show)

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,559
(Children Talent Show)
(I'm Xu Jingjing's neighbour)

282
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,079
(Children Talent Show)
(since little.)

283
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,760
(Children Talent Show)
(Did you know how long has it been)

284
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,520
(since we're neighbours?)

285
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,559
(Ever since we're born.)

286
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,439
(Did you know how suffering is this?)

287
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,199
(She's that child)

288
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
(Children Talent Show)(that every parent would love to have.)

289
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,880
(As long as Xu Jingjing is around,)

290
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,079
(Certificate of Achievement)
(my weaknesses will be amplified.)

291
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,799
(Certificate of Achievement)
(My success turned into failure.)

292
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,280
Dad, mum.

293
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,079
Dad, mum.

294
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,479
I pass my final examinations.

295
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,400
Mum.

296
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,079
I got a perfect score again.

297
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,959
I'm the only one
who scored full marks in the class.

298
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,120
(Xu Jingjing's presence)

299
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
(brings a lot of pressure)

300
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,679
(to my life.)

301
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,799
(But I didn't know why)

302
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,160
(she's always against me)

303
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,719
(and sabotaging me.)

304
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,760
She gets closer to Conan.

305
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,319
Suddenly, someone barged into the room.

306
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,920
Xu Jingjing.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,959
The lunch break is for us
to read your textbook.

308
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,959
What are you doing?

309
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm going to demerit your marks.

310
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,000
Why do you demerit my marks only?

311
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,679
What about them?

312
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:15,839
Why don't you demerit their marks too?

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,760
You're the one who takes the lead.

314
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,280
You're trying to lead us astray.

315
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,839
I...

316
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,640
Do you understand now?

317
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,479
Xu Jingjing has been
against me since little.

318
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,679
She doesn't like me.

319
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,839
But now...

320
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,079
What do you mean?

321
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,679
It must be the same this time.

322
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,959
She got my letter.

323
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,240
She knew that it's for Gao Zhan.

324
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,799
And

325
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,880
she has feelings for Gao Zhan too.

326
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,599
So, she purposely embarrasses me.

327
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,040
Is that so?

328
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,199
Xu Jingjing doesn't
seem like a bad person.

329
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,959
When I went to
exchange my school uniform,

330
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,240
she helped me.

331
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,760
I know.

332
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,319
I know.

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,079
You like Xu Jingjing, don't you?

334
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,160
No.

335
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:01,880
Yes.

336
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,799
No.

337
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,560
Very well, Kang Jiawei.

338
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,640
You said

339
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,279
that all beauties look alike,

340
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,800
but an interesting soul
is one in a million.

341
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,840
In the end,

342
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,120
you're still judging
people by their looks.

343
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,239
No, I...

344
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,679
I don't like her...

345
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,279
You like her.

346
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,759
I'm...

347
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,320
I'm interested in her because...

348
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,199
Why?

349
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,439
Because she looks a lot
like my online friend.

350
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,640
Kang Jiawei.

351
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,999
You should be a scriptwriter.

352
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,039
I mean it.

353
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,279
I recognise her

354
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,320
on my first day in Yuming Senior High School.

355
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,880
She's that online friend

356
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,679
I've known through Douban
for more than two years.

357
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Is she that

358
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,439
Give-up Virtuoso?

359
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,439
I swear I didn't lie.

360
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,759
No wonder

361
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,999
you wore a muscle shirt.

362
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,360
It's for Xu Jingjing, isn't it?

363
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,120
Stop.

364
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:56,120
What's that called, Kang Jiawei?

365
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,479
Flogging

366
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,640
a dead horse.

367
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Pointless.

368
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,400
I won't do that anymore.

369
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,840
That style doesn't fit me.

370
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,160
Any style wouldn't fit you.

371
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,239
Besides,

372
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,640
Gao Zhan rescued her

373
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,719
like a knight in shining Armour.

374
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,719
Xu Jingjing must be
madly in love with him now.

375
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,479
That's impossible.

376
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,199
I've gotten close to
Gao Zhan and Xu Jingjing.

377
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,880
They're just friends.

378
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,160
You're partially right.

379
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,719
Gao Zhan treats Xu Jingjing

380
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,160
as a friend.

381
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,679
But Xu Jingjing

382
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,239
has a crush on Gao Zhan.

383
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,120
Actually, I think that man

384
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,039
wouldn't show up anymore.

385
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,039
He must be shocked
from yesterday's incident too.

386
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,920
We can't take a chance on this.

387
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
Whenever we lower our guard,

388
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
evil people would take advantage on us.

389
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
Look. They're standing
far away from each other.

390
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,439
They're obviously just friends.

391
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,519
Can't you see that there's stories

392
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,800
inside Xu Jingjing's eyes?

393
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,320
That's because she has pretty eyes.

394
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:56,800
You're judging a book

395
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:57,999
by its cover.

396
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,999
Are you using idioms now?

397
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,759
What are you trying to say, Kang Jiawei?

398
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,039
Let's go.

399
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,920
Think about it
with your obstinate brain.

400
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,920
If Xu Jingjing envies you

401
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,479
due to Gao Zhan,

402
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,439
why didn't she just

403
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,199
destroy the letter?

404
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,560
Why did she place it in my drawer?

405
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,880
She wants to upset me.

406
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,400
Upset you?

407
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,600
What do you mean?

408
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,980
(Wei Xue 701)

409
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,380
(Li Huiya)

410
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,740
(Li Huiya)

411
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:04,860
(Li Huiya 199608)

412
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,661
(Li Huiya 199608 shares a video)

413
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,800
The game has ended.

414
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,999
Although Class 3 still lost in the end,

415
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,279
friendship comes first.

416
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,400
Hurry up and look.

417
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,959
Look what did I find.

418
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,400
What did you find?

419
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,320
Don't act on impulse,
or else you'll regret for sure.

420
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,120
Don't stop me.

421
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,279
I'm going to confront Wei Xue.

422
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,199
Confront her?

423
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,719
We don't even have evidence.

424
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,279
But she might the one

425
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,400
who took my letter.

426
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,560
That doesn't prove

427
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:35,360
that she's the one

428
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:36,759
who put the letter in my drawer.

429
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,160
What should we do then?

430
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,800
It's...

431
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:45,800
Hello.

432
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,400
Are you Li Huiya?

433
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:50,959
I know you.

434
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,279
Xu Jingjing, Kang Jiawei.

435
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,120
You transferred here for Xu Jingjing.

436
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
No, well.

437
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,479
What's the matter, Xu Jingjing?

438
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,239
Are you okay? Don't cry.

439
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,920
She doesn't mean that.

440
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,640
It's alright.

441
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,279
Well.

442
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Actually, Xu Jingjing

443
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,640
didn't write the letter for me.

444
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:14,999
Everyone in the school

445
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,400
has been talking about this.

446
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,080
We're rather pressured.

447
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,199
Why are you looking for me?

448
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,239
We're here as we saw the video you took

449
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,479
on Weibo.

450
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:30,519
By the way,

451
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:31,759
that's a really good video.

452
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,999
I even follow your account
and like the post.

453
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,279
Okay, back to the topic.

454
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,239
The video of the basketball game

455
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,880
stopped after the appearance

456
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,719
of the letter.

457
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
Did you continue recording it?

458
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,759
If you have the raw video,

459
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,320
could you show it to us?

460
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,560
Are you mad, Master Kang?

461
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Why did you step on my feet?

462
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,679
To gain her sympathy.

463
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,880
If Li Huiya really thinks

464
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,880
that you're crying

465
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,120
because of her,

466
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,360
she might feel guilty

467
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,719
and tell us the truth.

468
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,759
She didn't agree though.

469
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,160
Well, I need to step on your feet too.

470
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,759
Gosh, you really like to take revenge.

471
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,239
Xu Jingjing.

472
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,320
He's here.

473
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,080
You both can chat. I'm leaving.

474
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm sorry about what happened

475
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,880
on the day of the battle.

476
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,039
That's all?

477
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,120
Is this

478
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,279
all?

479
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,640
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,160
Well, aren't you going to explain

481
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
or find excuses?

482
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,439
I didn't stand you up

483
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,400
on purpose.

484
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,719
Xu Jingjing

485
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,519
gave me a call...

486
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,439
I knew.

487
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,759
Kang Jiawei told me.

488
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,519
Why did you

489
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:49,479
ask for my explanation then?

490
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm sorry then.

491
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,439
I apologise.

492
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,519
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

493
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,199
Wait a minute.

494
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:03,560
What about this?

495
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:04,679
Let's not compete.

496
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:05,840
I'll be the President right away.

497
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,479
As an apology.

498
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,560
Seems like you still don't understand

499
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,160
how important is Taekwondo to me.

500
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,719
I'm serious about

501
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,800
battling with you.

502
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,679
Hence, I don't need your sympathy.

503
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,800
That's not what I meant.

504
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,640
What about this?

505
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:27,759
Let's have another battle.

506
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,600
You can set the time.

507
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:29,999
I'll surely show up this time.

508
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,600
Never mind.

509
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,320
I decided to dismiss the club.

510
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:34,679
Dismiss?

511
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,080
We don't have much members.

512
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,279
Xiaobai and Wang Jiayao

513
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,600
were forced to join.

514
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:40,679
Including you.

515
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,080
Actually, this is better too.

516
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,679
I don't have to force anyone.

517
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Forget about our bet.

518
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Gao Zhan has apologised to you.

519
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,160
Why are you still gloomy?

520
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,479
He even said
that he can be the president

521
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,840
without the battle.

522
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,519
That's good news.

523
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,239
Congratulations, Xu Jingjing.

524
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
Gao Zhan has come to save you.

525
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,239
It's considered as rescuing you.

526
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,400
Rescuing a beauty.

527
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,279
What did you reply?

528
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,600
I rejected his offer.

529
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,479
You're playing hard to get.

530
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,560
Not bad, Xu Jingjing.

531
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,600
You're better than I think.

532
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,679
No.

533
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,800
I really like the club.

534
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,640
Whoever that's going to lead it,

535
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,519
must be someone
who loves Taekwondo dearly.

536
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,239
If there's no someone like that,

537
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I better dismiss the club.

538
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,320
No, I'm...

539
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,120
It's Li Huiya.

540
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,600
What did she say?

541
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,080
She has sent us the video.

542
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
The game has ended today.

543
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,560
Although Class 3 still lost in the end,

544
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,800
friendship comes first.

545
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,880
Hurry up and look.

546
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,479
Look what did I find.

547
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,519
What did you find?

548
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,360
Hurry up.

549
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,360
I saw your jacket swaying in the wind

550
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,479
while you're riding a bicycle.

551
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,279
It's a love letter.

552
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,360
Who would write a love letter nowadays?

553
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,999
There's a name here.

554
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,120
XJJ.

555
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:37,560
XJJ.

556
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,360
Who is it?

557
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Xu Jingjing.

558
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,880
Xu Jingjing.

559
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,600
Wei Xue.

560
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,400
Stop reading the letter.

561
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,199
This is someone's privacy.

562
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:44,840
It's not appropriate.

563
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,320
Xu Jingjing.

564
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,439
Why does it sound so familiar?

565
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,120
It's the girl who was hit earlier.

566
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,679
It's her.

567
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,039
Your class's mascot.

568
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:55,679
Enough.

569
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:56,439
Enough, Xu Jingjing.

570
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,439
Did you see it?

571
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
How did she shout earlier?

572
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,719
Class 3 will win!

573
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,360
Class 3 will win!

574
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,320
You're her neighbour, Jingjing.

575
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,920
Who is this letter for in your opinion?

576
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,560
How would I know?

577
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:11,759
Just have a guess.

578
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,320
We won't tell the others too.

579
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,239
Just guess it.

580
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:14,679
Make a guess.

581
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,640
Well, Jingjing.

582
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,239
Is this for Kang Jiawei?

583
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,679
Who's Kang Jiawei?

584
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,640
That fat boy who landed on

585
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,239
Xu Jingjing earlier.

586
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,719
You're her neighbour, Jingjing.

587
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,160
You should know better, right?

588
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,400
Tell us.

589
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,400
Is this for Kang Jiawei?

590
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,719
Am I right?

591
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Am I right?

592
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,039
Just tell us.

593
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,999
Maybe?

594
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,959
Stop torturing yourself.

595
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,320
Xu Jingjing.

596
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,400
You're the one who ask me to hit you.

597
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,199
Why did you say such thing?

598
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:56,840
Xu Jingjing.

599
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,640
Leave me alone.

600
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,719
Tell me.

601
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,279
Speak!

602
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,679
What are you saying?

603
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:02,479
You,

604
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,439
Xu Jingjing, and the others.

605
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,199
Hand phone.

606
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,360
I saw your jacket swaying in the wind

607
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,439
while you're riding a bicycle.

608
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,759
How did you get this video?

609
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:18,759
That's none of your business.

610
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,120
Did you put the letter

611
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,560
inside Kang Jiawei's drawer?

612
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,439
Do you have evidence?

613
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:27,679
Well, Wei Xue.

614
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,320
Why didn't you return

615
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,920
the letter to Xu Jingjing?

616
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,479
If you didn't return it,

617
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,120
where did you put the letter?

618
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:39,920
You can't answer me, can you?

619
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:41,080
This is the evidence

620
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,279
that you sabotaged us.

621
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:43,880
Sabotage?

622
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,279
What kind of sabotage is this?

623
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,999
Did you not write

624
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,360
a love letter, Xu Jingjing?

625
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,519
That's not even a love letter.

626
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,239
You sabotaged me.

627
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,999
I'm one of the victims.

628
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,279
What do you want then?

629
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,840
Are you going to report to the teacher?

630
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
So, she'll know
that what you've admitted

631
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,239
are all lies?

632
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,800
Wei Xue.

633
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,759
What did I do wrong to you?

634
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,439
I won't tell the teacher.

635
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,279
But at least I can

636
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,640
share about

637
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,279
your glorious acts

638
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:09,920
on the school's Tieba

639
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,920
and Tencent QQ group chat.

640
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,759
Do you think people would care?

641
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,360
Fine.

642
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,560
Let's bet on this.

643
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,959
Let's see if people would think

644
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,479
that it's nothing other than a joke,

645
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,360
or would they think

646
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,759
that you're lowly and ridiculous

647
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,400
as you violated other's privacy.

648
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,199
You...

649
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
What?

650
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,999
Didn't Gao Zhan say it?

651
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,360
Reading others' letter

652
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,199
and opening others' letter

653
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,560
are serious violations

654
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,840
of others' privacy.

655
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,199
What do you want from me?

656
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,360
An apology.

657
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
Apologise to me and Xu Jingjing.

658
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,920
Are you still in primary school?

659
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,920
You're the primary school student here.

660
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,279
Kids nowadays wouldn't even

661
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,199
do such a prank.

662
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,840
How old are you now?

663
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,120
Aren't you embarrassed?

664
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,560
That's right.

665
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,920
She's so immature.

666
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
She won't go away with this.

667
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,880
Apologise to us.

668
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,199
I'm sorry.

669
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,039
Do you hear that, Xu Jingjing?

670
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,560
I didn't hear anything.

671
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm sorry.

672
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,600
I'm sorry. Are you happy now?

673
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,640
Well, she has apologised.

674
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,479
But that's not
how people should apologise.

675
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,120
You're right. It's not sincere.

676
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,620
(Atour Hotel)

677
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,880
Try this.

678
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,239
Whenever I'm in a bad mood,

679
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,560
I'll visit this place.

680
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,880
Don't be upset.

681
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:39,719
Wei Xue's prank

682
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,120
went a little too far.

683
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,239
But she meant no harm.

684
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,360
It's not that.

685
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:47,880
Don't you understand

686
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,439
how people see us now?

687
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,279
Even if she apologises again,
I'm still upset.

688
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,759
I'm extremely upset. Do you know?

689
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,800
Who do they think

690
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:56,560
they are?

691
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,160
Who do they to look down on us?

692
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,199
Just because that we're ordinary?

693
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,759
Is being ordinary our fault?

694
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:07,800
Did you know?

695
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,679
Since young,

696
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:11,800
I'm always

697
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,920
being compared

698
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,959
to Xu Jingjing.

699
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,800
We were at
the children's palace together.

700
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,080
However, whenever

701
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,080
there's a performance,

702
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,519
she's the only one who'd be chosen.

703
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,160
She could be the lead character.

704
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,199
What about me?

705
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,840
I could only be the audience.

706
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,360
Not even a supporting character.

707
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,840
Well.

708
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,160
Should we

709
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
get used to such a life,

710
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
in which we are never the leading roles?

711
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:39,840
Give me your hand.

712
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,120
What are you doing?

713
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,080
Where are we going?

714
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,400
Stand here.

715
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,039
What's the matter?

716
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,519
Who says
that you're not the leading role?

717
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,160
Xu Jingjing. You're the main character.

718
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,999
You draw Pipi so well.

719
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,679
You are good at Taekwondo.

720
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,479
You're funny, hilarious,

721
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,600
kind, brave.

722
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,120
You're not ordinary.

723
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,120
Why would you

724
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,360
care about what others think?

725
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,439
Remember.

726
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:17,519
You're your own

727
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,279
true main character

728
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,439
under the spotlight of your life.

729
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:34,719
Hold this.

730
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,360
What are you doing?

731
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,600
You'll know later.

732
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,160
What's the matter?

733
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,959
Why are you taking a picture of me?

734
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,920
You'll know afterward.

735
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,039
It's true that all fat boys are
potential handsome men.

736
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,120
What?

737
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,160
Is this me?

738
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:10,199
Handsome, right?

739
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,519
Hurry up and share it with me.

740
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,239
Send this to me.

741
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:12,880
Why?

742
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Do you want to use it
as your profile picture

743
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,800
and bluff the girls online?

744
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,120
No, I don't mean that.

745
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm so...

746
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,279
Be honest, Kang Jiawei.

747
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,439
Do you want to get handsome?

748
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,080
Am I not handsome now?

749
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,039
Am I not manly enough?

750
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,239
Am I not attractive enough now?

751
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Seriously, stop it.

752
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,479
The muscle shirt you wore

753
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,759
reveals that you're not
happy with your current self.

754
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:35,160
Alright.

755
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,519
Let's not talk about looks.

756
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm sure you don't want to

757
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,759
get diagnosed with diseases
at a very young age

758
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:40,999
and can't even
walk without panting, right?

759
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:41,880
Are you cursing me?

760
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,120
I'm concerned about your health.

761
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,400
Do you want

762
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,640
to diet?

763
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,080
Me?

764
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,479
I've been trying to lose weight

765
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:49,800
since little.

766
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,800
You must have used

767
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,120
the wrong methods to diet.

768
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,519
Kang Jiawei.

769
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:55,959
I think

770
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,479
that we should form an alliance

771
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,800
and help each other.

772
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,719
You shall help me with my studies,

773
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,759
while I'll help you with your diet.

774
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,759
Show me the picture

775
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,840
again.

776
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,080
Stop thinking about it.

777
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:25,999
Listen.

778
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,600
When you get handsome,

779
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,120
whereas I get to be an ace student,

780
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,120
we'll both become

781
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,239
a better version of ourselves.

782
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,239
Those

783
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,479
who look down on us

784
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,759
will then regret.

785
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:54,880
I've analysed

786
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,400
your mid-semester examination papers.

787
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,239
Although you failed three subjects,

788
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,199
you have different scores.

789
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,239
Chinese is okay.

790
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,840
As the problem is that
you didn't memorise the texts.

791
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Next, English.

792
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,880
It's mostly about sentence structure.

793
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,439
The worst is

794
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,479
Mathematics.

795
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,519
Can you lower down your voice?

796
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,039
Are you embarrassed now?

797
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,599
Why didn't you study harder then?

798
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:18,840
You got 48 for Mathematics.

799
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,079
That includes
three multiple-choice questions,

800
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,800
which you guessed them right.

801
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,400
Otherwise, you should be getting

802
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,200
36 instead.

803
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,320
Guessing them right is a skill too.

804
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,880
You've been learning
for half a semester now.

805
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:28,920
You should be getting marks

806
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,559
for the basic questions.

807
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,959
I blame my genes.

808
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,200
My parents weren't
good with their academics too.

809
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,240
Don't blame it on your genes.

810
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,720
You didn't study hard.

811
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,920
I must have

812
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,959
dyslexia then.

813
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:38,599
Otherwise,

814
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,599
why couldn't I understand the questions?

815
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,479
Complete the sentence.

816
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,999
Even function remains,
odd function changes.

817
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,639
Generating function is even,
sub-function is odd.

818
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,320
Look.

819
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,159
I guess it right.

820
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,039
You don't even know

821
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:56,559
about the basic formula.

822
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,519
What did you do
when you were in the tenth Grade?

823
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,800
Enough.

824
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,119
You're lucky to have met me.

825
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:02,680
I'll teach you from the beginning.

826
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,439
From today onwards,

827
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,200
you must not copy others' homework.

828
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:07,999
What?

829
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,119
Well.

830
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:11,079
Doing homework is the basic job

831
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
as a student.

832
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,280
If you don't even do your job,

833
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,360
you'll be fired.

834
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:16,559
Hurry up.

835
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,519
Stop covering it.

836
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,840
I have no hope for you.

837
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
What is your weight?

838
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,540
(202.8 jin)

839
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,840
100kg?

840
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,680
Muscle mass percentage is 36%?

841
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,639
Lower down your volume.

842
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,159
Well.

843
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,680
Are you embarrassed now?

844
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,280
School uniform.

845
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,280
It must be

846
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,159
due to the weight of the jacket.

847
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,559
Even a pig

848
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,959
will weigh lighter than you.

849
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,119
I'm better than you.

850
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,400
Nonsense.

851
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,119
You don't know, do you?

852
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,079
The body fat content of a pig

853
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,400
will not exceed 15%.

854
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,400
If a human's body fat content

855
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,400
is lower than 15%,

856
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,360
you shall be able to see

857
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,320
his eight-packs.

858
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,439
Do you have it?

859
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:53,880
Do you have it?

860
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,559
Don't try to change the topic.

861
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,519
We're talking about

862
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,599
your weight.

863
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,360
It must be the genes.

864
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,439
My grandfather and great grandfather...

865
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:01,999
Don't blame it on your genes.

866
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,280
You didn't try harder.

867
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,559
I didn't set my mind

868
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,599
previously.

869
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,760
I've set my mind now.

870
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,760
My goal is to lose 30kg a month.

871
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:12,519
I'll show you.

872
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,200
30kg?

873
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,320
Do you know how much

874
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,360
is 30kg?

875
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,999
About this?

876
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,479
20kg.

877
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:28,647
Promise?

878
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,519
This is
your weekly meal plan.

879
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:35,760
And this is

880
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,559
your weekly exercise plan.

881
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,159
I don't need these.

882
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,760
I know that I need to
eat less and exercise more.

883
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,479
No.

884
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,720
How could you eat less?

885
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,240
How could you exercise
with an empty stomach?

886
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,280
Do you need to act so professionally?

887
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,639
Of course.

888
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,039
We must lose weight
healthily and scientifically.

889
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,320
It's all about how

890
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,200
and what you eat.

891
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,320
Listen.

892
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,519
You can still have three meals a day.

893
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,400
But you must avoid

894
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,479
consuming food with
high sugar and fat content.

895
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
You must eat two portions of vegetables,

896
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:01,720
one portion of protein,

897
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,079
one portion of carbohydrates every meal.

898
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:03,720
But the carbohydrates

899
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,599
must not exceed 200g.

900
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,280
Braised pork belly is a kind of protein.

901
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,959
It's too little to eat with rice.

902
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,159
You'll get fat easily

903
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,119
if you eat it with rice.

904
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,240
I'm not eating the rice then.

905
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,439
I'll only eat the meat.

906
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,320
Hold on.

907
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,880
Get rid of the fatty meat.

908
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:18,999
Stop.

909
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,200
What?

910
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,840
The fatty meat

911
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,079
is the essence of braised pork belly.

912
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,280
This is such a waste!

913
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,920
Don't get too agitated.

914
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,119
Of course I'm agitated.

915
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,439
Five thousand years
in the Chinese civilization,

916
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,599
to finally produce the best recipe

917
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,639
to make braised pork belly.

918
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,079
Such a delicacy is placed
right in front of my eyes.

919
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:34,680
Yet, you won't allow me to devour it.

920
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Isn't that a torture to me?

921
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,079
I'm torturing you.

922
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,639
You must suffer

923
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
in order to become a handsome man.

924
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:40,479
There's no

925
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:41,479
free lunch in this world.

926
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,680
We must progress gradually

927
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,639
and slowly.

928
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,920
I'll just take one bite.

929
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:45,400
Just one bite.

930
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,240
Not even one bite.

931
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,200
Put down your chopsticks.

932
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,840
I'll have only one bite.

933
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:48,959
Xu Jingjing.

934
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,280
I need to talk to you.

935
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,840
I'm full. I shall leave first.

936
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,200
Just one bite.

937
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:11,455
(Dining Hall)

938
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,079
(Dining Hall)
Jingjing.

939
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,240
Xu Jingjing.

940
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,079
I really need to talk to you.

941
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,559
I have nothing to talk to you.

942
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,360
I know that you watched

943
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,320
that video.

944
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,159
I'm sorry.

945
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,119
I...

946
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,760
Xu Jingjing.

947
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,280
If I didn't

948
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:26,360
watch that video,

949
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:27,559
would you treat it as if

950
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,039
nothing has happened?

951
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,639
I didn't expect

952
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,479
Wei Xue to do that.

953
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,959
If you don't know,

954
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,320
don't say something
that will mislead others.

955
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,880
I said so

956
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
due to

957
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,959
the atmosphere then.

958
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,439
Atmosphere?

959
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Xu Jingjing.

960
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,800
I thought we've grown up.

961
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,200
I thought we could
just mind our own businesses

962
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,720
in high school.

963
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,159
I...

964
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,680
I beg you.

965
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,159
Leave me alone.

966
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,240
I don't know why you did this.

967
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,639
Since we're little,

968
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,920
you've always been against me,

969
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,479
humiliating me.

970
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,400
This time,

971
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,400
I won't forgive you.

972
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,760
Did you see my performance earlier?

973
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,840
Yes.

974
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,800
I almost fell asleep.

975
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,760
Xu Jingjing.

976
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:31,920
I think that your Taekwondo

977
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,720
is more interesting than ballet.

978
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,680
Xu Jingjing.

979
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,159
Please teach me Taekwondo.

980
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,720
I don't want to learn ballet anymore.

981
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:38,760
It's always Xu Jingjing

982
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:39,920
who gets to go on the stage.

983
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:40,800
That's so boring.

984
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:41,439
Let's

985
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,800
play with Xu Jingjing.

986
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,159
Come on.

987
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:45,200
Okay.

988
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,159
Hurry up, Xu Jingjing.

989
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,320
What did yesterday's
Conan show talk about?

990
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,119
Did he turn back into an adult?

991
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,760
Yes.

992
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:57,920
Since Xu Jingjing isn't here yet,

993
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,760
hurry up and tell us about it.

994
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,159
That's right. If Xu Jingjing's here,

995
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,800
she'll report to the teacher again.

996
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,720
How annoying.

997
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,479
Alright, I'll tell you about it.

998
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:16,800
Are you alright?

999
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,360
Kang Jiawei.

1000
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,760
I owe you an apology too.

1001
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:25,880
I didn't say that on purpose.

1002
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,559
In the video, I...

1003
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
I know.

1004
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,200
You don't need to explain.

1005
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,320
Everyone

1006
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,240
was looking at me,

1007
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,920
waiting for me to speak.

1008
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,320
I'm afraid

1009
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,720
that if I refused to say anything,

1010
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
they'd be disappointed.

1011
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,599
I saw it.

1012
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,519
You advised Wei Xue

1013
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,519
to return the letter to Xu Jingjing.

1014
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:49,880
But I did a mistake.

1015
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
I can't deny about it.

1016
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,920
You can blame me.

1017
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,119
No.

1018
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,479
If Xu Jingjing hits you,

1019
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,800
that'll be serious.

1020
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,039
You'll get hurt.

1021
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,959
I do this occasionally too.

1022
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,959
It's alright.

1023
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,079
Sometimes, I speak
without a second thought.

1024
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,159
The moment I said that,

1025
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:13,119
it felt nice.

1026
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,280
But I regretted right after.

1027
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,439
Are you forgiving me?

1028
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,360
From today onwards,

1029
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,999
Do aerobic exercise for an hour daily

1030
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,920
and anaerobic exercise for half an hour.

1031
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,280
I'll train with you.

1032
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,400
Give me your hand.

1033
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,999
Why?

1034
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,240
Your hand.

1035
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:50,280
Put this on.

1036
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,360
This is too expensive.

1037
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,039
I can't accept this.

1038
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,280
Stop it.

1039
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,280
When you're wearing this,

1040
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,880
your heart rate, location,

1041
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,039
and your sports update

1042
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,840
will be synced

1043
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,639
to my phone.

1044
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,439
If I'm not around,

1045
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,760
I can monitor you remotely.

1046
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:06,159
What are we doing today?

1047
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,079
Skipping rope.

1048
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,680
Let's set a small goal.

1049
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,999
500 skips.

1050
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,559
Is 500 skips a small goal?

1051
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,119
My size is big, coach.

1052
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:16,999
Skipping ropes is bad for my knees.

1053
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,439
I knew you'd say this.

1054
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:39,720
Where are you going?

1055
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,479
I've set it in my phone.

1056
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:43,519
If your heart rate is lower than 95,

1057
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,639
the alarm will ring automatically.

1058
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,280
Only 200 skips?

1059
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,079
Didn't you eat during lunch? Hurry up.

1060
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,079
Tenth Grade Mathematics?

1061
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,559
Are you humiliating me?

1062
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,999
You're humiliating yourself.

1063
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,959
I checked your capability.

1064
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,039
You're bad at Mathematics as

1065
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,280
you didn't learn
tenth Grade Mathematics well.

1066
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,280
No.

1067
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,920
If we traced back,

1068
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:27,639
your junior high knowledge
isn't sturdy too.

1069
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,599
Are you joking with me?

1070
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,119
Yuming Senior High School
is the regional key school.

1071
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,920
I got admitted to this school

1072
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,079
with my own capabilities.

1073
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,639
That's because you're lucky.

1074
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,079
These are my notes.

1075
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:42,840
It's priceless.

1076
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,999
Many people want it,

1077
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:44,999
but I won't give it to them.

1078
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,680
From now onwards,

1079
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,360
complete this exercise book.

1080
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,159
I think it's quite decent.

1081
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,119
The questions are well-crafted.

1082
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,360
If what you said is true,

1083
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,959
as long as you mastered
the key points in tenth Grade,

1084
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,119
you'll be able
to solve these in 30 minutes.

1085
00:43:58,479 --> 00:43:59,039
Hurry up.

1086
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:01,119
30 minutes?

1087
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,360
No, Master Kang.

1088
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
I need ten more minutes.

1089
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,800
The clock starts now.

1090
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,200
Hurry up.

1091
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:11,720
Quicker.

1092
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,079
Speed up.

1093
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,519
Didn't you have breakfast?

1094
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,039
I didn't eat much.

1095
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,559
Kang Jiawei.

1096
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,599
It has been half an hour.

1097
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,079
Yet you've just ran 2km.

1098
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,599
I can walk faster than you run.

1099
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,559
I can't do this anymore.

1100
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,280
You can do it.

1101
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm going to faint.

1102
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:35,880
Choose the shortest answers
if the other three are lengthy.

1103
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,720
Choose the longest answer
if the other three are short.

1104
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,320
If there are two short answers
and two lengthy answers, pick B.

1105
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,880
If it's roughly the same, choose C.

1106
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,559
If there are three lengthy answers
and one short one, choose...

1107
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,519
Time's up.

1108
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,320
Time's up.

1109
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,039
Wait a minute.

1110
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:50,720
I haven't finished writing.

1111
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:52,119
-I...
-Stop.

1112
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,840
Do you say this to the teacher

1113
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,079
when you hand in
your examination papers?

1114
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,479
Well, Xu Jingjing.

1115
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,360
Did it work?

1116
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,439
What did you say?

1117
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Didn't I explain the questions

1118
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,559
to you yesterday?

1119
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:14,680
Did I get it all wrong?

1120
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:15,599
No.

1121
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,840
You write your name right.

1122
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,559
Are you going out to jog again?

1123
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:39,999
What's her name?

1124
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,720
Is she your classmate?

1125
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:43,360
Who?

1126
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,880
I advised, scolded

1127
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,240
and threatened you.

1128
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:50,680
You won't even budge.

1129
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:52,840
Now, you're jogging everyday.

1130
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:53,519
It must be

1131
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:54,920
the power of a female classmate.

1132
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:56,559
Dad.

1133
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,039
Please act

1134
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,240
like a normal parent will do.

1135
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:01,200
Stop encouraging youngsters

1136
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:02,240
to date at a young age.

1137
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,439
I think that my deductions

1138
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,360
are right.

1139
00:46:06,439 --> 00:46:07,079
Wait a minute.

1140
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:09,999
Wear this.

1141
00:46:10,439 --> 00:46:11,280
As the saying goes,

1142
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,720
a good saddle fits a good horse.

1143
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,280
I'm not wearing the shoes that mum gave.

1144
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,039
This isn't from your mum.

1145
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,200
No.

1146
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,159
I transferred her the money.

1147
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:21,360
It's not auspicious
to gift someone a pair of shoes.

1148
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:22,200
Dad.

1149
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,880
I'll say it one last time.

1150
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,240
I have nothing to do with her.

1151
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,639
I will not accept her gift.

1152
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,079
Okay, never mind.

1153
00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:41,999
What do you mean?

1154
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:43,079
Where is this?

1155
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:46,680
You can't go there.

1156
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:47,479
Let's go.

1157
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,680
Pawn Slouch.

1158
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:50,439
Look, you lose.

1159
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm sorry, you can take the move.

1160
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:52,959
Go on.

1161
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:53,760
Check.

1162
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:55,880
You're good in

1163
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,320
playing chess, lad.

1164
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,519
Come on.

1165
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:00,920
It's my turn now.

1166
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:02,639
I'm careless earlier.

1167
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:04,079
Look at you.

1168
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,519
It's up to you now.

1169
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,260
(Xu Jingjing)

1170
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,039
Uncle.

1171
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,479
What are you doing?

1172
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,479
What?

1173
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,400
What can I do?

1174
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:19,959
I'm jogging.

1175
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,240
Why are you jogging so slowly today?

1176
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,039
The watch must be faulty then.

1177
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,720
Well.

1178
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:29,559
Hello?

1179
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,999
Hello?

1180
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,240
The connection isn't good here.

1181
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:33,999
I shall continue jogging.

1182
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:34,840
I can't hear you.

1183
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,840
Can you hear me now?

1184
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:37,800
Who is this?

1185
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:42,880
What's the matter?

1186
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,280
I can surely win this round.

1187
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,159
You have no chess manners.

1188
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,439
Suit yourself.

1189
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:50,840
Run.

1190
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:53,439
You humiliate me.

1191
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,360
You?

1192
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,680
Are you a human?

1193
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,680
I meticulously

1194
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,800
created a plan for you.

1195
00:47:58,119 --> 00:47:59,519
What about you?

1196
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,320
How could you play chess in the park?

1197
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Gosh, the thought of it
makes my blood boil.

1198
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:05,280
Quicker! How could you play chess?
