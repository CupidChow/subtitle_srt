(The blessing of five cups of ice-cream)

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Didn't we agree to finish

17
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,384
the holiday homework on your own?

18
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,393
Kang... Kang Jiawei?

19
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:40,472
That's right.

20
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:42,312
It's me.

21
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,272
Wake up! Wake up! Xu Jingjing.

22
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:46,152
It's a dream.

23
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,633
Wake up! Wake up! Xu Jingjing.

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
It must be a dream!

25
00:02:58,913 --> 00:02:59,992
It really is Kang Jiawei.

26
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,272
Why do you look

27
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:04,872
so different?

28
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,592
Did you have a plastic surgery?

29
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:08,193
What plastic surgery?

30
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:09,032
Master Kang is

31
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,233
the David in the stone.

32
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:11,953
When he was surrounded by fat,

33
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:13,032
I already noticed it.

34
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:14,793
He's quite handsome.

35
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,353
Almost as handsome as I am.

36
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:20,913
Have you finished copying
the holiday homework,

37
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:21,592
Dobby?

38
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,473
I tell you what.
If you call me Dobby again,

39
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:29,712
I'll stamp...

40
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:40,513
A bet is a bet.

41
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:41,513
I've lost weight.

42
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:43,552
And you're still copying homework.

43
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:45,913
Master Kang, you...

44
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,353
You're despicable.

45
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:49,552
What do you mean?

46
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:51,673
I lost weight through

47
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:52,233
my own effort.

48
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:53,073
What do you mean I'm despicable?

49
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:54,592
Then, tell me.

50
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,113
What's with "Master Kang's exploration
of new shop"?

51
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:58,552
So it's about that matter?

52
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:01,432
Wait.

53
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:03,393
I need to take a photo.

54
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,193
What are you doing?

55
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:06,272
To post a review.

56
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:07,233
Dad,

57
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:08,953
I need a favour.

58
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:09,633
Shoot it.

59
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,992
Give me your phone.

60
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:17,192
What are you doing?

61
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:18,673
Here.

62
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:20,392
Post this month's review

63
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,913
on my account.

64
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,473
I've got a lot of fans on my account.

65
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,192
They'll miss me
if I stop posting reviews.

66
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:27,992
I beg of you, Dad.

67
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:29,952
This is a matter of my honour.

68
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:30,872
By the way,

69
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:31,913
Dad,

70
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,072
remember to make the content

71
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,392
look like it's written by a young man.

72
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:35,033
Do not write it

73
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:36,273
like a middle-aged uncle.

74
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:39,072
You're asking me a favour,
how dare you call me Uncle?

75
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:39,872
Brother.

76
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:40,713
Brother!

77
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,233
Here's to you.

78
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,113
Save it.

79
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:45,992
No, Kang Jiawei,

80
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,273
you've gone too far.

81
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,992
This is so-called decoying the enemy.

82
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:51,552
Xu Jingjing.

83
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:53,593
It's time for class.
Why are you still chatting?

84
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:56,473
Which class are you from?

85
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:58,913
Ms. Chen, it's me,

86
00:04:59,273 --> 00:04:59,992
Kang Jiawei.

87
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:03,392
Kang Jiawei?

88
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,153
Impressive.

89
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:08,872
You've lost a lot of weight
during this holiday.

90
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:12,273
You're a diamond in the rough.

91
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,512
Stop chatting. It's time for class.

92
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,273
Do you hear her?
I'm a diamond in the rough.

93
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:18,473
Hurry up.

94
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:20,992
Fellow students,

95
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:22,632
let's arrange our seats

96
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:23,552
for this semester.

97
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:24,833
Yes!

98
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,072
Spend a good time
with your new tablemate

99
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,033
on the new semester.

100
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:37,793
Kang Jiawei.

101
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:38,752
Kang Jiawei.

102
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:39,952
Kang Jiawei.

103
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:41,392
Kang Jiawei.

104
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:42,833
Kang Jiawei.

105
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,872
No, what's going on?

106
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:54,952
Why does Kang Jiawei return

107
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:56,033
to his original seat?

108
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:57,153
Gao Zhan.

109
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,392
Over there. Over there.

110
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:09,153
Gao Zhan is sitting on the same place.

111
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,432
Looks like the distance
between me and Gao Zhan

112
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,992
has become further.

113
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,552
Xu Jingjing.

114
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:36,913
It's strange.

115
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:37,833
What are they laughing at?

116
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:38,632
Why don't they

117
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:39,872
sit next to Kang Jiawei?

118
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:41,833
There must be something fishy.

119
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:43,192
Lu Xiaobai.

120
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:44,713
I'll get going.

121
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:46,713
It's just the three of us now.

122
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,512
Lu Xiaobai, you... you're laughing.

123
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:53,432
Xiong Shuai.

124
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:55,392
I get it.

125
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:57,312
He gets it?

126
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,833
Why don't I get it?

127
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:01,033
This is not normal.

128
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:02,273
Ni Dapeng.

129
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,233
Rest assured, Jingjing.

130
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:05,632
I'll take the seat if no one takes it.

131
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,432
As expected from my Brother Peng.

132
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:12,233
Yes!

133
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:13,713
You're the best, Brother Peng!

134
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,072
It hurts my bottom.

135
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,153
The Iron Throne is meant for the Queen.

136
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,153
No.

137
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,752
No, what's going on?

138
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:23,273
Did this Fatty Kang

139
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,353
bribe them all?

140
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:25,593
Xu Jingjing.

141
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,900
(The seat of the domesticated elf)

142
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:37,992
What are you doing?

143
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,233
Miss, he cheated.

144
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:41,913
What happens?

145
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:47,833
Stop laughing.

146
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,353
Who's willing to sit with Kang Jiawei?

147
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,153
You can switch seats with Xu Jingjing.

148
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,673
Xu Jingjing.

149
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:05,673
Sit down.

150
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,632
Okay, let's begin our class.

151
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:16,233
Turn to page three.

152
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,233
The domesticated elf and the master

153
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,473
will always be together.

154
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:22,752
Shut up.

155
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:32,553
Do you two think I look like

156
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,353
Dobby in the Harry Potter film?

157
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,833
Why are they laughing at me?

158
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:38,113
Come here, let me take a look.

159
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:42,193
You do look alike.

160
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:43,073
Buzz off.

161
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,713
You didn't see

162
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:45,553
how annoying

163
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:46,672
Kang Jiawei was.

164
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:48,752
It's easy to deal with him.

165
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:50,872
You've got an idea?

166
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,113
In the film,

167
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,953
the rule for the domesticated elf is

168
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:56,593
that if the master is willing

169
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:57,872
to give it a piece of clothing,

170
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:58,912
it'll be free.

171
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:00,713
So,

172
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:01,992
you have to make Kang Jiawei

173
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:02,992
give you a shirt

174
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,392
when he's not paying attention.

175
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:06,953
Right.

176
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,512
Why didn't I think of that?

177
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:10,353
But Kang Jiawei is

178
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:11,872
indeed different on this semester.

179
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:13,433
To put it in the painters' term,

180
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,233
he is

181
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,912
perfect.

182
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:17,593
You must not say that

183
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:18,792
in front of him.

184
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:20,272
If he heard it,

185
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,872
he'd get carried away.

186
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,593
If you won the first place
of the grade,

187
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,193
you'd be carried away as well.

188
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,032
He got a wonderful life now.

189
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:30,272
He becomes handsome.

190
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:31,353
And he's lost weight.

191
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,032
He does well in studies.

192
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:33,953
What about me?

193
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,032
I'm still the last on the list.

194
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:38,193
Look.

195
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,992
At least Kang Jiawei helped you pass

196
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:40,833
the math exam.

197
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,073
Does it mean

198
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:43,833
that you don't have to attend

199
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,833
Zhang Chang'an's tuition class
on this semester?

200
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,632
Right.

201
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:50,833
Then, I can get

202
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:52,272
the Taekwondo Club

203
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,233
back in business!

204
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,272
President,

205
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:56,512
this week

206
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,073
happens to be
the recruitment week.

207
00:09:58,313 --> 00:09:58,872
Really?

208
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:00,233
Then, let's make it big.

209
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:01,593
Sure.

210
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:16,233
Congratulations

211
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,233
on getting back in business.

212
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:18,992
You guys talk. We'll get going.

213
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:27,392
Kang Jiawei, it's a bit chilly.

214
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:28,233
Can you lend me

215
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,433
your jacket?

216
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:37,713
Are you trying to rebel?

217
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,433
You're trying to leave
your master, Dobby?

218
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:43,113
I can't believe you noticed it.

219
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:44,392
Just give up.

220
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:45,992
I won't you give you any chance.

221
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:48,672
Today, you'll have

222
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,353
your first task as a domesticated elf.

223
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:53,032
From now on,

224
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,152
manage the fans

225
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:54,912
for me every day.

226
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:56,752
I'm not going.

227
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:57,953
Unlike them, I'm busy.

228
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:02,672
Do you want me to tell

229
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,953
Mr. Zhang that you didn't do

230
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:04,833
the holiday homework?

231
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:06,593
Despicable.

232
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:07,792
Shameless.

233
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,073
Vile person.

234
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,912
I'm not afraid of you.

235
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,193
Good.

236
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:15,632
You have guts.

237
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,433
Then, I'll just tell

238
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,193
Mr. Zhang about this.

239
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:23,113
Sorry, Master, I was wrong.

240
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,713
Goodbye, Master.

241
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:26,792
Where is he?

242
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:28,272
Kang Jiawei. Kang Jiawei.

243
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,353
Run!

244
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:40,272
He's so handsome. Jiawei. Kang Jiawei.

245
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,792
Jiawei. Kang Jiawei. Jiawei.

246
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:45,512
Why do the girls

247
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,593
always give Kang Jiawei so many gifts?

248
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:52,073
Don't you think Kang Jiawei looks
handsome now?

249
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,752
He's more popular than Gao Zhan now.

250
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:54,833
Am I blind?

251
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:56,593
Why can't I see his handsomeness?

252
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:58,953
Kang Jiawei is very popular now.

253
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:00,553
Why don't we ask him to be

254
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,073
the ambassador of the Taekwondo Club?

255
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:02,912
Forget it.

256
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,713
I should stay away from him.

257
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:07,752
Mr. Zhang.

258
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:08,872
Mr. Zhang.

259
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:10,953
Xu Jingjing, where are you going?

260
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:12,953
Mr. Zhang.

261
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,272
What is this?

262
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:19,672
This is

263
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,433
something I prepare for the recruitment.

264
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:22,833
It's the club again.

265
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:25,313
The tuition class

266
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:26,272
will begin in a while.

267
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,392
Let's go.

268
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,512
Why should I attend the tuition class?

269
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:32,193
There is no why.

270
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:33,953
No, Mr. Zhang,

271
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:35,992
I passed the math exam last semester.

272
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,353
Didn't you say I needed to attend

273
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:38,752
the tuition class
only if I didn't pass the exam?

274
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,233
You expect very less of yourself.

275
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,672
You're already satisfied
with passing the exam once?

276
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:43,953
No, Mr. Zhang.

277
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:44,872
You should at least pass

278
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,473
the major exams three consecutive times.

279
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,313
Only then I'll allow you
not to attend the tuition class.

280
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,152
Then, what about my Taekwondo Club?

281
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,353
I've prepared everything for it.

282
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:53,272
I even printed out

283
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:54,113
the flyer.

284
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,073
Didn't I say

285
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:56,953
you're not allowed
to skip the tuition class

286
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:58,672
before you pass the exam
three consecutive times?

287
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,032
Three times?

288
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,672
But I've passed the exam
on this semester.

289
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:03,113
Besides, it's impossible for me

290
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:05,353
to start a new club
when I'm in senior year.

291
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,792
The club or your study,
which is more important?

292
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,713
Don't you know it?

293
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,433
Do you need me to teach you that?

294
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,233
You're Kang Kang's tablemate,
aren't you?

295
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,272
Please give this to him.

296
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:27,152
And this.

297
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,152
Stop giving

298
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:30,152
these things to him.

299
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,313
What do you mean?

300
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:33,512
Anyway...

301
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,313
Anyway...

302
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,833
Anyway,

303
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:44,512
he can't eat the things

304
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:46,553
that you give him.

305
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:48,953
What's wrong?

306
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:51,433
Well,

307
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,433
do you know why he lost

308
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,953
a lot of weight
during this winter break?

309
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:06,032
Forget it.

310
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:08,353
I promised him not to tell
anyone about it.

311
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:12,792
Well,

312
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,872
please tell him

313
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:17,593
to be strong

314
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:18,672
and cheer up.

315
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,512
We... we won't disturb

316
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:22,113
him anymore.

317
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:23,872
Thanks for your understanding.

318
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,233
Just let him spend his final moments

319
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,313
to enjoy the flowers

320
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:29,233
and plants in the school alone.

321
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:31,433
God must've found

322
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:32,752
that he's too handsome.

323
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:33,473
We...

324
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:34,433
We must

325
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,392
silently get him through it.

326
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:17,833
Xu Jingjing,

327
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,113
what have you done?

328
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:23,792
It seems to be

329
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:24,953
fewer people following me recently.

330
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,392
Really?

331
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,473
That's good.

332
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,512
Dobby Xu is not

333
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,752
that useless after all.

334
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:37,313
Keep it up.

335
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:39,272
I've told you many times.

336
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:40,912
Do not call me Dobby Xu.

337
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:49,672
What a narcissist.

338
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:52,713
What do you know?

339
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,833
To be honest with you.

340
00:15:56,713 --> 00:15:57,353
I'm still not used

341
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:58,193
to this face of mine.

342
00:15:58,473 --> 00:15:58,953
It feels like I'm looking

343
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:00,073
at someone else when I look at myself.

344
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,433
It feels strange.

345
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,792
You're humblebragging now.

346
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:06,512
You don't know it.

347
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,353
I have my own troubles as well.

348
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,992
Now that you've become a handsome guy.

349
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:12,512
And you're a scholar-lord.

350
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,713
What is it that troubles you?

351
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:16,953
Is it Xu Jingjing?

352
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,392
Didn't you always want to watch

353
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:25,953
Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom?

354
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:31,593
You're here, Mayonnaise.

355
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,032
It's Mayonnaise with Rice.

356
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:35,872
That's great.

357
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:37,233
I couldn't find

358
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,553
this Moonrise Kingdom.

359
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,512
It's rare to meet someone who likes

360
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:43,152
Wes Anderson's production like I do.

361
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,272
This is the only film
I haven't watched.

362
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:46,433
So do I.

363
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,073
Which one of his films
do you like the most?

364
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:48,912
I...

365
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:53,313
I like the most about his...

366
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:54,953
The Darjeeling Limited?

367
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:57,433
Fantastic Mr. Fox?

368
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,473
Budapest?

369
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,392
Bu... Budapest.

370
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:05,033
Me too.

371
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:08,872
Xu Jingjing.

372
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,353
Actually, I'm Kang Jiawei.

373
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,672
We...

374
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,152
You said

375
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:27,553
the good appearances are stereotyped.

376
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:30,273
Only an interesting soul is
one in a million.

377
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,232
How do you feel about it now?

378
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,033
Why do you suddenly ask me this?

379
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,392
I'm just curious.

380
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:42,833
If

381
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,033
I must choose between an interesting man

382
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,872
and a good-looking guy,

383
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:49,273
I insist on choosing
the interesting one.

384
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:52,513
Let's stop here.

385
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,753
I got to go for training.

386
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:55,793
Training?

387
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:57,273
Our school

388
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:58,672
will hold a basketball game
on every semester.

389
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,353
The preliminary round is going to start.

390
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:03,113
As expected,

391
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:04,232
you like the boy who plays basketball.

392
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:07,793
How did you know that I'm a girl?

393
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:09,353
You've never met me before.

394
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:20,073
I'll begin by talking

395
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,513
about our training in these two days.

396
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:22,872
Our performance

397
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:24,672
and the hit rate have been enhanced.

398
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:26,073
- Good.
- Good.

399
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:28,152
Keep it up.

400
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:28,793
But,

401
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,152
we still got a lot

402
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:33,872
of weaknesses.

403
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:35,593
Especially when it comes to defenses.

404
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,432
For example, the rebounds and steals.

405
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,073
I need to know now.

406
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:41,912
Our class has drawn Class 6

407
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:42,952
in this preliminary round.

408
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:44,632
What should we do?

409
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:46,753
And Gao,

410
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:48,993
I can't participate in this game.

411
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,033
There's a training
for hurdlers this week.

412
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,793
How can you bail on us?

413
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,073
I...

414
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:56,113
I was expecting

415
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:57,793
you to man-mark

416
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:58,833
Niu Junfeng from Class 6.

417
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:00,793
What about Dapeng?

418
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:02,553
Don't you have to attend
the tuition class?

419
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:03,392
No.

420
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:04,553
Bro,

421
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:05,712
Zhang Chang'an happens to have

422
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:06,793
teaching and researching meeting
this week.

423
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:07,432
The tuition class

424
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:08,872
happens to be canceled for a week.

425
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,672
I'll be there for sure.

426
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,593
Rest assured, Bro.

427
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,472
Why do you keep calling me Bro?

428
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:14,553
Then, what should I call you?

429
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,472
Should I call you Brother?

430
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:17,793
Brother Gao Zhan?

431
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:19,232
Get lost.

432
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,073
I'm worried

433
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,553
that we'll be eliminated by Class 6

434
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,073
in the preliminary round.

435
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:28,152
I'll join it too.

436
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:32,672
Gao,

437
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,313
I'll cut to the chase.

438
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:35,472
Will you

439
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:36,353
give me a chance?

440
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,392
Master Kang,

441
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,033
did you forget how we lost

442
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:43,192
the game last semester?

443
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,392
That's why I'd like to make up
for it this time.

444
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:46,593
There's nothing wrong with my skill.

445
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,392
You saw it too.

446
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,753
I was held back by my weight

447
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:49,392
last semester.

448
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:50,952
Nothing will hold me back this time.

449
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:08,192
You're training?

450
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:10,912
My old rivals.

451
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:12,073
We meet again.

452
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:12,833
Let's just

453
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:13,833
take a dive.

454
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:15,672
Or they'll lose at the first round.

455
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:16,712
It's pathetic.

456
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:17,273
Niu Junfeng,

457
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,113
don't push it.

458
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,712
Today, we'll win for sure.

459
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:23,432
Cut the nonsense.

460
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:25,672
Be prepared to lose.

461
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:28,712
Fatty,

462
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:30,313
you've become more handsome.

463
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:31,872
But what's the point?

464
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:33,192
Do you do the dunk with your face?

465
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:36,513
They're mad.

466
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:37,192
Time to go.

467
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:38,073
Let's practise.

468
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:42,273
Gao,

469
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:44,073
thanks for letting me join the team.

470
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:44,952
Don't mind it.

471
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:46,553
I won't let

472
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:47,432
you down this time.

473
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:49,033
Come.

474
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:51,273
One, two, three, you can do this!

475
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:52,232
Let's go warm up.

476
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,073
Once the five players
from Class 6 intervene,

477
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:57,793
the players from Class 3 will be a joke.

478
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,152
You can do this!

479
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:02,073
Hidden gems are all in Class 3,

480
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,912
you'll surely succeed and never lose.

481
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,313
Beware of the fast break.

482
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:27,753
Once the five players
from Class 6 intervene,

483
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:30,513
the players from Class 3 will be a joke.

484
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:39,793
Kang Jiawei!

485
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,672
Kang Jiawei!

486
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,580
(Yuming Friendship before competition)

487
00:21:58,392 --> 00:21:59,793
Nice shot!

488
00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:01,712
Foul! Out of bound!

489
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,432
Good!

490
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:12,553
Once the five players
from Class 6 intervene,

491
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:15,513
the players from Class 3 will be a joke.

492
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:28,632
Dapeng, I'll man-mark him.

493
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:45,313
Thank you.

494
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,152
Kang Jiawei, you can do this!

495
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:50,993
Kick Niu Junfeng's ass!

496
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,553
What are you talking about?

497
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:57,273
Go!

498
00:22:57,472 --> 00:23:00,273
The miracle in life,
the legend of an underdog,

499
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:02,273
no one else but Kang Kang.

500
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:03,593
Xu Jingjing!

501
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,392
The miracle in life,
the legend of an underdog,

502
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:06,073
no one else but Kang Kang.

503
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:06,632
Just you wait.

504
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:16,273
Thank you.

505
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,513
Thank you.

506
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:23,833
Kang Jiawei continues

507
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:25,232
to man-mark Niu Junfeng
in the second half.

508
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:27,712
Dapeng runs more

509
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,073
to pin down the defender.

510
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:30,793
To create more chances for us.

511
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:39,872
Kang Jiawei!

512
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:41,672
Kang Jiawei!

513
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:43,353
Kang Jiawei!

514
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,392
Kang Jiawei!

515
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:40,033
What's going on?

516
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:48,553
You can do this, Gao Zhan!

517
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:52,993
What's on your mind? Hustle back.

518
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,432
What is Niu Junfeng doing?

519
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,513
You're such a sore loser!

520
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:03,313
What are you doing?

521
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:03,993
Sorry.

522
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:04,753
Are you biased against our class?

523
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,513
You're biased against our class.

524
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,392
It's a misunderstanding.

525
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:07,392
You did it on purpose!

526
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:08,152
It's alright.

527
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:08,753
Let's continue.

528
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:09,432
It really is a misunderstanding.

529
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,993
Let's continue.

530
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:16,833
I don't know.

531
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,912
How could this happen?

532
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:27,672
Keep it up!

533
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:30,753
Keep your guard up!

534
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,152
We'll win if we prevent them
from making the shot.

535
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:33,472
Strengthen the defense.

536
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:34,833
You can do this, Class 3!

537
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:38,712
What are you waiting for?
Strengthen the defense!

538
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:39,872
Guard them!

539
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:49,553
Make the shot!

540
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:51,313
We're running out of time.
Make the shot!

541
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:53,192
Kang Jiawei, you can do this!

542
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:01,472
Time is running out!

543
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:03,712
Kang Jiawei!

544
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:07,712
Fight on!

545
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:11,952
(Kang Jiawei,)

546
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:13,993

547

♪A dazzling morning, a sunny day♪

548

550
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:33,273

556
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:57,632
Here.

557
00:26:57,753 --> 00:26:58,232
We finally

558
00:26:58,392 --> 00:26:59,353
defeat Class 6 this time.

559
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:02,232
We finally avenge
our humiliation in 11th Grade.

560
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:03,793
Master Kang,

561
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:04,793
you're definitely the most valuable

562
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:05,632
player in this game.

563
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,553
You're stronger

564
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,073
than someone from Class 6, right?

565
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:12,392
Who are you accusing?

566
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:14,432
Do you feel guilty?

567
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:15,833
If you Class 6 played well,

568
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:16,753
why would you feel guilty?

569
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:18,073
Do you really think

570
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:18,753
you're a big shot?

571
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,392
Don't you forget we're in school now.

572
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:21,833
So what?

573
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,033
If you're the real deal,

574
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:23,793
you should lay low.

575
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:24,353
If you're a fool, you...

576
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:25,712
Don't try to fool me!

577
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:28,192
You did this to him!

578
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:29,513
Are you trying to blackmail me,
Kang Jiawei?

579
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:30,152
You blackmail me.

580
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:31,392
I...

581
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:32,472
Look at me, I didn't touch him.

582
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:33,192
You didn't.

583
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:33,912
I didn't...

584
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,033
He's touching me.

585
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:37,872
Okayl, Kang Jiawei. Well played.

586
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:38,672
Let's go!

587
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:39,952
- Get lost!
- Let's go.

588
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:46,672
Are you alright?

589
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:49,952
I'm fine.

590
00:27:51,113 --> 00:27:51,553
Master Kang,

591
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:53,753
you're good at acting.

592
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:54,753
I didn't expect you
to have such a skill.

593
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:58,353
Are you really alright?

594
00:27:58,872 --> 00:27:59,952
You don't look well.

595
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:01,753
I can even

596
00:28:01,952 --> 00:28:02,952
play one more round.

597
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:05,993
I'm fine.

598
00:28:06,273 --> 00:28:06,872
Bro,

599
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,833
we eliminated Class 6 this time.

600
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:10,073
Let's go celebrate.

601
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:11,033
It'll be my treat.

602
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:12,712
Let's go.

603
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:14,993
Let's go.

604
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:15,753
Let's go.

605
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:16,553
You guys go first.

606
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:17,952
I've got something to do.

607
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:19,472
Okay, be quick.

608
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:20,472
Go on.

609
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,232
We'll get going.

610
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,273
Kang Jiawei from Class 3

611
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:37,392
is so handsome.

612
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,232
He's got an incurable disease
but he still plays well.

613
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:39,993
Yes.

614
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:41,392
I've become one of his fans.

615
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,833
Those whom the gods love die young.

616
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:45,553
I'm screwed.

617
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:47,793
If Kang Jiawei knew about it,

618
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:48,993
he would get back at me.

619
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:49,993
I didn't expect

620
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,232
you to pull such a prank on him.

621
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:52,632
What can I do?

622
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:53,993
He asked me to manage his fans.

623
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,313
I was out of moves.

624
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:56,952
I found

625
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:58,192
that you didn't cheer

626
00:28:58,392 --> 00:28:58,872
for Gao Zhan today.

627
00:28:59,033 --> 00:28:59,593
Didn't I?

628
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:00,392
You didn't.

629
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:03,553
I didn't do it because I...

630
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:06,793
Is that Kang Jiawei?

631
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:11,232
Let's go check on him.

632
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,300
(Houde Building)

633
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,553
Kang,

634
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:15,553
are you alright?

635
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:20,553
What's wrong?

636
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:22,273
Are you trying to make friends

637
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:23,192
with the most valuable player?

638
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:25,632
I don't have the time for this.

639
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:26,712
Wait.

640
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,313
What's with the incurable disease?

641
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:37,232
What incurable disease?

642
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:38,392
I know nothing about it.

643
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:39,472
Don't play dumb with me.

644
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:42,712
You admitted that it was quite useful.

645
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:45,632
Indeed.

646
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,993
Don't you think it's gut-wrenching
for the fans?

647
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,113
Xu Jingjing.

648
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:51,912
If you can't accept it,

649
00:29:52,113 --> 00:29:52,872
don't ask me to be

650
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:53,872
your domesticated elf.

651
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:54,912
I didn't do my job well.

652
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:56,192
And I smeared you.

653
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,033
Do you think

654
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:57,993
you can get rid of me in this way?

655
00:29:58,712 --> 00:29:59,833
You're too naive.

656
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:05,392
Hurry up.

657
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:06,793
Quickly sit down.

658
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:07,513
You're having hypoglycemia.

659
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:08,553
Does anyone of you have a candy?

660
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:09,593
Me, I have.

661
00:30:13,152 --> 00:30:13,993
Is it sugar free?

662
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,872
Stop being picky at a time like this.

663
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:16,593
Eat it.

664
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:32,472
You really are

665
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:33,753
a competent domesticated elf.

666
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:35,313
Don't take this lightly.

667
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:36,753
This is a very serious hypoglycemia.

668
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:38,192
Don't make a fuss about it.

669
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:39,392
It's no big deal.

670
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,672
Do you know it'll lead

671
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,712
to coma if it's serious?

672
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,793
It's been a long time
since I worked out.

673
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,712
I've exercised too much today.

674
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,632
I'll send you home
if you don't feel well.

675
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:49,432
It's not necessary.

676
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,113
Thanks for your loyalty,

677
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,073
Dobby Xu.

678
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:54,313
I have to go to the celebration party.

679
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,590
(Houde Building)

680
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:56,313
(Houde Building)
I'll get going.

681
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:01,952
Bye bye.

682
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:04,313
Is he really okay?

683
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,793
It won't kill him
as he still can talk back to me.

684
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:08,073
Let's go.

685
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:25,313
Mate,

686
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:26,712
come join our Animation Club.

687
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:27,313
We'll have

688
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:28,033
cosplay activity every week.

689
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,033
Take a look at it.

690
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:29,952
Look at this.

691
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:33,392
Mate,

692
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,793
join our Drama Club.

693
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,793
You'll always be the female leads.

694
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:37,872
You'll be the next

695
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:38,593
best actress of Yuming.

696
00:31:38,753 --> 00:31:39,593
Come, take a look.

697
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:40,753
Come.

698
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:41,553
Come.

699
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:42,113
Thank you.

700
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,392
Mate, come to Debate Club.

701
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:44,672
You'll be invincible
when it comes to argument.

702
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,232
Invincible.

703
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:48,113
Welcome to Instant Noodle Club.

704
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:49,632
You can eat free instant noodle
every week.

705
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:50,192
Come on.

706
00:31:50,192 --> 00:31:50,872
Give it a try.

707
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:56,432
Well,

708
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:58,192
I was supposed to be one of them

709
00:31:58,432 --> 00:31:59,432
and yelling here.

710
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,033
Don't be sad, Jingjing.

711
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:03,113
But you two

712
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:04,152
don't have to mind about me.

713
00:32:04,353 --> 00:32:06,152
You can join any club you want.

714
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:07,033
I'll be

715
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:08,232
happy for you.

716
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:09,432
Really?

717
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:10,712
Yes, well,

718
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:12,313
how happy would I be

719
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,472
if I could see you do

720
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:14,993
something you like?

721
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,033
Don't you think?

722
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:20,993
I was just spitballing and you two...

723
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:23,593
Betrayers!

724
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:25,152
Xu Jingjing.

725
00:32:28,392 --> 00:32:29,273
Why are you here?

726
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:30,593
I thought you weren't interested

727
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:31,472
in joining clubs.

728
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:34,232
Does the promise
from last semester still count?

729
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:36,273
I know

730
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:37,313
if I tell you

731
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:38,192
that I want to be the president

732
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:39,993
and establish Taekwondo Club again,

733
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,152
I'm sure you won't agree to it.

734
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,553
So I'd like to ask you

735
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:44,632
if the battle we agreed on still counts.

736
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:49,392
Attention!

737
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:50,952
What a life-changing event.

738
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:52,353
Xu Jingjing versus Gao Zhan.

739
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:53,593
Doofus versus Scholar-lord.

740
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:54,753
Queen Kong versus school hunk.

741
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:56,113
It's a match of the century.

742
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:56,912
Does anyone want to bet?

743
00:32:57,073 --> 00:32:59,073
The minimum bet is
a pack of spicy snack.

744
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:00,273
There's no maximum limit.

745
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,152
Do not miss it.

746
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,152
I'll bet on Gao Zhan.

747
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:05,833
With two packs of Lay's.

748
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:06,632
Okay.

749
00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:07,392
Record it.

750
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,232
Wait.

751
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,313
Let's not bet on the winner.

752
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:13,712
We won't guess
who the winner is this time.

753
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:14,952
Let's guess

754
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,432
if Gao Zhan will attend the contest.

755
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:18,753
Then, I guess

756
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,192
Gao Zhan will attend it.

757
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:21,712
Okay.

758
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:23,472
Wei Xue, two packs of Lay's.

759
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:25,073
Who guesses Gao Zhan won't attend it?

760
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:25,593
Is there anyone else?

761
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,912
I guess Gao Zhan won't come.

762
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:28,073
One pack of spicy snack.

763
00:33:28,113 --> 00:33:28,632
Anyone else?

764
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:29,353
Me too.

765
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,392
Three bottles of Genki Forest,

766
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:31,353
flavoured with passion fruit.

767
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:32,672
Three bottles of Genki Forest!

768
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:33,833
Two packs of Good Good Eat.

769
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:34,833
I'm sure Gao Zhan won't come.

770
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:36,033
Two packs of Good Good Eat!

771
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:36,712
Record it.

772
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:37,753
Five cups of Haagen-Dazs.

773
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:39,712
Five... five cups of Haagen-Dazs?

774
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,513
Master Kang, you're so generous.

775
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:43,353
Come.

776
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:44,392
Record it for Master Kang.

777
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:45,432
Five cups of Haagen-Dazs.

778
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:46,593
He guesses Gao Zhan won't come.

779
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:47,993
Who told you I want to bet on this?

780
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,192
I guess Xu Jingjing will win.

781
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:56,392
Xu Jingjing will win?

782
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,073
Kang Jiawei?

783
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:04,033
Why haven't you left?

784
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:07,353
It's boring to go home alone.

785
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,192
So I wait for you.

786
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:10,553
How's the tuition class?

787
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,113
Did Mr. Zhang teach better than me?

788
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:13,712
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

789
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:16,073
By the way,

790
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,152
I heard that you bet on me.

791
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:19,672
Are you out of your mind?

792
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,113
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

793
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,113
Five cups of Haagen-Dazs!

794
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,312
It'll be a big loss for you, you know?

795
00:34:23,513 --> 00:34:24,152
Why?

796
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,232
Even I myself

797
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:27,113
regret it now.

798
00:34:27,352 --> 00:34:28,192
I greatly regret about it.

799
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:29,593
Why didn't I do

800
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:30,553
as he told?

801
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:31,832
Why didn't I just let

802
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:32,873
him be the president?

803
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,232
How could I fight him?

804
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:34,993
He's so tall.

805
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:36,513
How could I defeat him?

806
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,113
Isn't this asking for death?

807
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:40,073
Stop nagging.

808
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:41,513
Xu Jingjing,

809
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:43,192
don't always think

810
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,513
that you're incapable of doing anything.

811
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:46,792
I know

812
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:48,752
you can do it

813
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:50,033
if it's something you care about.

814
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,473
Kang Jiawei,

815
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,712
is it because you bet on me,

816
00:34:56,913 --> 00:34:57,632
that's why you work

817
00:34:57,752 --> 00:34:58,873
so hard to flatter me.

818
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:00,073
You're afraid I'd abstain?

819
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:02,033
Xu Jingjing,

820
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:04,832
I don't care if you believe it or not,

821
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:07,113
I really hope
that you could win this time.

822
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:09,152
You... As you act like,

823
00:35:09,352 --> 00:35:10,593
I feel a little uncomfortable.

824
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:11,993
I noticed this when we fought

825
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:12,792
the rogues.

826
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,272
You'll become very strong

827
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:15,433
and confident

828
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:16,873
when you're doing something

829
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:17,792
you're good at.

830
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:19,113
That you'll shine and glow.

831
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:21,192
Everyone will be attracted by you.

832
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,152
This is a great chance.

833
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,152
As long as you take it easy,

834
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:27,913
do the Taekwondo that belongs to you,

835
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:28,752
you'll be able

836
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,832
to impress everyone including Gao Zhan.

837
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,433
Whatever the outcome is,

838
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:35,272
it doesn't matter at all.

839
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:38,632
Kang Jiawei,

840
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:40,632
so you can talk like a human.

841
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:43,953
I've finished

842
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:44,913
what I can say.

843
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:47,152
Mainly because I'm afraid
you'll make me lose.

844
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:49,473
Haagen-Dazs is too expensive.

845
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,433
Gao Zhan is here!

846
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,672
Gao Zhan is here!

847
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:02,873
Gao Zhan, fight on!

848
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:08,513
Jingjing, fight on!

849
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:10,393
Gao Zhan, fight on!

850
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:21,433
Brother Xiong,

851
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:23,752
it'll be a big loss for us.

852
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,352
It's you.

853
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:26,593
Not me.

854
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,152
If I hit you hard,

855
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,192
feel free to tell me.

856
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:37,593
Let's not go easy on each other.

857
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:21,873
Gao Zhan, fight on!

858
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:26,033
