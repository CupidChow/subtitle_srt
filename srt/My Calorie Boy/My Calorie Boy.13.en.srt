Will Gao Zhan be going

18
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,679
to the field trip too?

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
Who? Never heard of him.

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Son,

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,599
what have I always taught you?

22
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,840
One must be generous

23
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,239
and tolerant.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
Especially men.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,959
Dad,

26
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,760
he was so disrespectful.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,840
How can you let him do that?

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,760
Pengpeng,

29
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:09,760
sometimes,

30
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,480
we need to put ourselves
in others' shoes.

31
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,360
Right?

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,839
I can understand him

33
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,279
completely

34
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,640
from his perspective.

35
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,080
Sometimes,

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
it isn't that easy to accept.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,999
Also, your dad

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,279
does have
quite a bit of catching up to do

39
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,799
when compared to his dad in terms

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,559
of temperament and image.

41
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:28,799
So do you think

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,719
maybe I should

43
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,519
change my appearance?

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
No.

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Why do you have to give in to him?

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,839
Who cares what he thinks?

47
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:35,959
All right, all right.

48
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:36,920
Don't stay mad.

49
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,320
Let me ask you something then.

50
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,679
What do you think

51
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,440
about Madam Shi?

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,799
She is nice.

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,399
That's what matters then.

54
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,399
I really do

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
want to develop my relationship

56
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,799
with her further.

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
So I have to improve myself

58
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,320
in all aspects

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
to become worthy of her.

60
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,200
Right?

61
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,320
Oh, right.

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,959
Say,

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,640
have any good movie recommendations

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,080
for me?

65
00:02:59,239 --> 00:02:59,839
I want to watch and learn from them

66
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:00,679
to improve myself.

67
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,799
They have to be movies of substance.

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
"Naruto".

69
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,239
"Naruto", right?

70
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,200
Listen to that title.

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,959
You know it's good from the title alone.

72
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:07,920
It already tells you

73
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,519
that men need to learn
to put up with things.

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,679
Who is the lead actor?

75
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,279
Who?

76
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,959
I don't know. It's an animation.

77
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,719
Animation?

78
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,959
I asked for movie recommendations.

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
You brat.

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
Fine, I won't ask you then.

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,320
I'll look it up myself.

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,040
Dad,

83
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,839
are you serious about Madam Shi?

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,839
Son,

85
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,399
a relationship

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
between a man and a woman
should always be serious.

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,080
Boy,

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,200
you shouldn't have that mentality.

89
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,119
It's not a good mindset to have.

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,839
Mr. Wu.

91
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:42,999
Oh, you're here.

92
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,600
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

93
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,640
Yes, yes. I'll be right down.

94
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:46,679
Give me a moment.

95
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,999
Coming.

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,780
(Hui)

97
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,240

98
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:30,599
Dapeng.

99
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:31,719
It's your turn, Dapeng.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,599
Catch the ducks!

101
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,599
How many?

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,519
Five!

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,359
Ni Dapeng!

104
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,440
Hurry up.

105
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,760
Five aces.

106
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,880
What? Five aces?

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,959
Are you cheating?

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,919
Take them back.

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
No, no, no.

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,220
(This is your mother's fiancé, David)

111
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,140
(Accept)

112
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
(Accept)

113
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,159
What are you doing?

114
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,279
Nothing.

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,959
Watching something
you aren't supposed to?

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,519
I was looking at an official account.

117
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,760
Really?

118
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,880
Yes.

119
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,719
Pipe down.

120
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll stress this again.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,399
This is a field trip
to study agricultural production.

122
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,159
It won't be as easy as you guys think.

123
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,080
In addition to the labour skills

124
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800
that everyone has to learn,

125
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,959
everyone will have

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,800
individual tasks too.

127
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
You must be serious.

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,760
The instructor

129
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,719
will record your performance

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,560
in

131
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,399
your field practice results.

132
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,159
Am I clear?

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,000
No problem.

134
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,599
Anything is easier than studying.

135
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,080
You said it.

136
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,839
In that case, Xiong Shuai and Dapeng,

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,159
you two will be in charge
of fertilising the fields.

138
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
What? Why am I collateral damage?

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,599
I didn't say anything.

140
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,680
Why am I getting swept up in this?

141
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,279
You guys are peas in a pod, aren't you?

142
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,640
As for everyone else,

143
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,839
you can refer to the list I sent
for your assigned tasks.

144
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,760
Okay.

145
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959
Potato harvesting.

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
What's yours?

147
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,760
Rearing chickens.

148
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,320
We weren't assigned the same task.

149
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,800
I hope that this field trip
to study agricultural production

150
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
will be more than a slapdash experience

151
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,560
where you not only learn
practical life skills

152
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,760
but also understand

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,519
the value and meaning of labour

154
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,359
to enhance your moral cultivation

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,399
and improve your creativity

156
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,719
and practical skills.

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,200
At the same time,

158
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,880
I am delighted

159
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,159
to be able

160
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,039
to spend the next few days with you all

161
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,680
to study agriculture and have fun.

162
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:22,919
Thank you.

163
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,080
Hi!

164
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,479
I'm Kang Jiawei.

165
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,279
How are you?

166
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,399
What's with that?

167
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,200
Is there something wrong with you,
Xu Jingjing?

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,320
You startled me!

169
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,560
What were you doing?

170
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,120
I...

171
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,320
I was...

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,640
I was practising my rap.

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,279
Get it?

174
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,039
Rap?

175
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Come on. Tell me what you're up to.

176
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,519
It's nothing.

177
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:07,880
What?

178
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,200
Did you need me for something?

179
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,120
Oh, yes.

180
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,440
Tomorrow,

181
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,919
Xu Jingjing and I
are in charge of digging up potatoes.

182
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,279
Gao Zhan is assigned to handle the dogs.

183
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:14,919
So

184
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,880
let's swap.

185
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,440
This way,

186
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:17,200
you'll get to dig potatoes

187
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,000
with Xu Jingjing,

188
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,080
and I can use the chance

189
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:19,760
to apologise to Gao Zhan tomorrow.

190
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,519
What do you think?

191
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,519
I'm smart, aren't I?

192
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,839
Sure... I'm fine either way.

193
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:28,839
Is that all?

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,599
Yes.

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,959
I'm okay with it.

196
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:32,959
No.

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,800
Kang Jiawei.

198
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,880
What has gotten into you?

199
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,479
Can't you be like the old you

200
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,560
and retaliate against everything I say?

201
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,919
I'm not used to this new you.

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
What sort of weird interest
is that, Xu Jingjing?

203
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,039
You want me to roast you?

204
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,839
Kang Jiawei,

205
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,240
you know

206
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,200
you can tell me anything.

207
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,399
I'm always here for you,

208
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,200
okay?

209
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,560
All right.

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,159
Got it.

211
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,519
Remember,
you're in charge of potatoes tomorrow.

212
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,240
I'll take the chickens.

213
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,200
Okay.

214
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,039
See you.

215
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Carry on with your rap practice.

216
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,359
Peace and love.

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:04,919
Peace.

218
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,560
Peace.

219
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,919
This isn't right.

220
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,279
Am I doing this right?

221
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes.

222
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,719
Why are you guys so fast?

223
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
We're using electric weed cutters.

224
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,560
Shut up.

225
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
If I had known
this would be so exhausting,

226
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,640
I would've pretended
to be sick and skipped this.

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Who said they were going to pretend
to be sick to get out of this?

228
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:32,759
Him!

229
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,599
Him.

230
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:35,560
Him.

231
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,280
Both of you

232
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,200
get out there and give me 20 push-ups.

233
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,320
No, I...

234
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,320
Chopping wood

235
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,599
looks easy.

236
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,080
But you must be calm

237
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:49,879
and have good eye-hand coordination.

238
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,599
The key

239
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,959
is to have a firm grip on the axe,

240
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,359
relax your joints,

241
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,200
chop downwards,

242
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,560
and make sure you're precise.

243
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,160
Okay.

244
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,119
Who would like to give it a try?

245
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,920
Me.

246
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,879
Me.

247
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:12,400
Dapeng,

248
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,320
don't break the axe.

249
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,599
Shut up.

250
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:37,680
Hi!

251
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,719
Hello.

252
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,759
Why am I talking in English?

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,639
Mom,

254
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,400
it has been a while.

255
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,280
How have you been?

256
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,599
Want me to help you?

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,040
I was recording that video

258
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,160
for David.

259
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,719
Who?

260
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,999
My stepfather.

261
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:20,839
I don't think my mom

262
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:21,999
has ever told him

263
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:23,759
that we haven't been in touch

264
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,719
in a long time.

265
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
He added me on WeChat.

266
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,080
He wants me to send a video

267
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,040
to give her my best wishes

268
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,520
for the wedding.

269
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,200
He probably wanted

270
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,160
to give her a surprise.

271
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:38,560
Kang Jiawei,

272
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,800
if you don't want to record the video,

273
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,560
you don't have to.

274
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,639
You don't need to force yourself.

275
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:42,719
No.

276
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,520
I want to do it.

277
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,999
I thought about it.

278
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:48,719
Only by letting her

279
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,759
watch this video

280
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,560
can I prove to her

281
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,200
that my dad and I

282
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,680
can do just fine without her.

283
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,839
Just like how

284
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:57,879
she is doing fine without us.

285
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:00,680
That's all the more reason

286
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,680
to let me help you.

287
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,639
I'm your personal photographer,
aren't I?

288
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,520
Come on.

289
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,599
I'll take you to a place.

290
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,800
This is it.

291
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,320
It has a nice lake view.

292
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:21,959
Let's start.

293
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,759
Mom,

294
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,479
long time no see.

295
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,639
This is Kang Jiawei.

296
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,280
Why are you laughing?

297
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:33,959
I'm sure she knows

298
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:34,999
who you are.

299
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:35,400
You...

300
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,719
Okay.

301
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,719
I won't laugh anymore.

302
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,759
Sorry.

303
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,080
Ready?

304
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,999
Mom,

305
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,879
long time no see.

306
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,359
I'm Kang Jiawei.

307
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,440
I've lost weight, haven't I?

308
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,920
I look handsome now.

309
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,239
I'm recording this video

310
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
because David contacted me.

311
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,879
He wants me

312
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,119
to send my best wishes to you.

313
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,119
He probably thought

314
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,440
that it would give you

315
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,080
a surprise.

316
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,839
I wish you...

317
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,359
Kang Jiawei...

318
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,359
Actually, I...

319
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,839
I've always wanted
to ask you a question.

320
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,160
Did you find happiness

321
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,239
after leaving us?

322
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,999
Did you find your greater purpose?

323
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:54,599
If so,

324
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,359
why come back looking for me,

325
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,040
the one who stole your life?

326
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
The sinner?

327
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,239
You're the one who told my father
that I shouldn't have been born

328
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,040
and that I ruined your life.

329
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,239
And now that you're overseas,

330
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,119
you say that you miss me
and you want to be my mother again.

331
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,479
Don't you think you're being unfair?

332
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:13,839
I heard from my dad

333
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,759
that you often cook

334
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,639
for David's daughter.

335
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,879
You must like them very much.

336
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
I remember when I was young,

337
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,839
all you cared about was studying

338
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,800
and going overbroad for your studies.

339
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,239
You never cooked a single meal for me.

340
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,200
I just don't understand

341
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,400
what I did wrong

342
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,920
that made you hate me so?

343
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I admit...

344
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,959
I admit

345
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,599
that my existence disrupted your plans.

346
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,280
But have you ever thought about

347
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,800
how I'm supposed to face my life?

348
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,359
Jiawei,

349
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,599
get up. It's time for the bonfire.

350
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,879
Help me ask for a leave of absence.

351
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,599
I'm not going.

352
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Miss Chen told me to come get you.

353
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,560
She says if you don't go,

354
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,520
she'll deduct your credits.

355
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,879
Come on.

356
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Quiet down, everyone.

357
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,320
Quiet down.

358
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,239
I

359
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,759
have a story to tell.

360
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,839
A senior a year ahead

361
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,639
told me

362
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,440
this tale.

363
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,920
It's a true story.

364
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,040
But I think

365
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,920
the girls

366
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,040
should cover

367
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,839
their ears.

368
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:52,560
Don't listen.

369
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Just the guys will do.

370
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,359
Oh, stop dallying.

371
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,119
Hurry up and get on with it.

372
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,400
You said it.

373
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,520
So you're not covering your ears?

374
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,040
Don't blame me if you get scared.

375
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,239
I'll start now.

376
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,440
Legend has it that a long time ago

377
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,639
in this village

378
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,280
lived a woman.

379
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,520
She and her lover
were very much in love.

380
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,160
There were already talks of marriage.

381
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,999
But one day,

382
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,119
the man felt

383
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,400
that he didn't have much savings,

384
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,119
so he wanted to go work in the city
to earn money

385
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,119
and come back and marry her.

386
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,599
The woman agreed.

387
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,280
He was gone

388
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,280
for a long time.

389
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,119
The woman waited every day
at the entrance of the village

390
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,999
for her lover to return.

391
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,400
But

392
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,680
she waited ten long years,

393
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,639
and the man never came back.

394
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,160
One day,

395
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
a young man from the city

396
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,359
came to the village

397
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,719
and told the woman

398
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,759
that her lover

399
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,479
had married another woman in the city

400
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,200
and he won't ever come back.

401
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,119
He told her that her lover
didn't want to marry her

402
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,520
because she was too ugly.

403
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,599
The woman was depressed

404
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,639
after hearing that.

405
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:52,680
And so,

406
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:53,920
she hung herself

407
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,680
on a tree

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,479
at the entrance of the village.

409
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,599
From then on,

410
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,520
on every dark and windy night,

411
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
the people

412
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,400
would see a woman in white.

413
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,719
The woman would ask them,

414
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:08,959
"Am I

415
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,200
beautiful?"

416
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,320
What's wrong with you?

417
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,999
You're the one
who wanted to hear the story.

418
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,119
I warned you.

419
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,560
Okay. That's enough.

420
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,479
Let's forget about the ghost stories.

421
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,520
Why don't we play a game?

422
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,560
Great idea!

423
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,200
- King's Game!
- King's Game!

424
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,160
How about King's Game?

425
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:23,839
- Sure!
- Okay!

426
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,920
Okay!

427
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's see who the king is

428
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,719
this time.

429
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
It's me!

430
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:35,719
How about this?

431
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,160
I want No.6 to hug No.3

432
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,719
and say what he/she likes

433
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
about No.3 with heartfelt emotions.

434
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,119
I'm No.6.

435
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,959
Who's No.3?

436
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,400
Could it be

437
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,440
Jiayao?

438
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,680
Sorry to disappoint you.

439
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,759
It's not me.

440
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,639
Who is it?

441
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,560
No way.

442
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
Master Kang...

443
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,760
Let's skip the hug.

444
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,080
Give us a performance.

445
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,679
Right.

446
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:08,879
Forget the hug. I'll give a performance.

447
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,560
No!

448
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,119
- No!
- You can't!

449
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,639
- No!
- No!

450
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,040
Fine.

451
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,720
Come on.

452
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,760
I...

453
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,320
Master Kang,

454
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,679
I am very thankful to you

455
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,080
for patiently explaining and tutoring me

456
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,560
for the midterms.

457
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,439
I like

458
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,439
your patience

459
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,040
and your clever mind.

460
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,639
That'll do, right?

461
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,839
Let's see who the king is

462
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,760
this time.

463
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,119
I'm the king.

464
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:49,919
I want

465
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,240
No.4

466
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:52,960
to hug

467
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,199
No.18

468
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,679
and say why he/she likes No.18.

469
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,960
Why is it always me?

470
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,679
Gao Zhan! Gao Zhan...

471
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,240
Gao Zhan...

472
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,919
Let's not do this...

473
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:09,480
Don't, Gao Zhan...

474
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,439
We don't have to do this, Gao Zhan...

475
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,320
I mean it...

476
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,520
Kang Jiawei,

477
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,879
thank you for taking me in.

478
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:17,760
Thank you

479
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,159
for not asking questions
I don't want to answer.

480
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,359
I like your courage

481
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,199
and your sense of justice.

482
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,560
- Great!
- Great!

483
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,560
Great!

484
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,199
Let's see who the king is

485
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,040
this time.

486
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,879
I'm the king!

487
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,119
Come on.

488
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,560
I want No.2

489
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,080
to hug No.8

490
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,080
and say why he/she likes No.8.

491
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,080
Why is it always me?

492
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,159
This... This game is rigged!

493
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:49,359
This... This game is rigged!

494
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,359
Rigged? No way.

495
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,080
Did we cheat?

496
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,800
No.

497
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:52,879
You guys definitely did!

498
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,919
I'm No.2.

499
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:57,919
How about this?

500
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,800
Since he thinks we're cheating,

501
00:18:58,919 --> 00:18:59,760
let's skip this round.

502
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,639
Skip this round.

503
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:02,159
Hang on!

504
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,240
What?

505
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,679
Let's finish this round first.

506
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:17,040
Thank you for shooting the video for me.

507
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,720
I really like it.

508
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,679
I like your talent,

509
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,000
your sense of humour,

510
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,199
and your kindness.

511
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,480
You're always there for me

512
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:27,839
when I'm troubled.

513
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,760
Thank you, Kang Jiawei.

514
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:51,679
You're welcome.

515
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,520
They're shy.

516
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,639
Master Kang,

517
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,119
I like the way you play ball.

518
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,280
You look really cool out there!

519
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,560
Kang Jiawei,

520
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,000
thank you for the vinyl record

521
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,720
you gave me.

522
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,879
I like your taste in music.

523
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,280
Master Kang,

524
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,720
I like how down-to-earth you are.

525
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,800
You're good-looking,
good in your studies,

526
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,839
and you hang out with us

527
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,560
and fool around with us too.

528
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:45,399
You're a good friend.

529
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,359
Kang,

530
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I have nothing else to say.

531
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,919
To have the fortune
of being your deskmate,

532
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,000
I must have saved

533
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,199
the galaxy in my past life.

534
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,399
What's with all of this?

535
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,679
You'll have to ask Jingjing that.

536
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,240
Well...

537
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,399
We just wanted you to know

538
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:56,240
that we adore you.

539
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,320
Happy birthday to you.

540
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,879
Happy birthday to you.

541
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,480
Happy birthday to you.

542
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,040
Happy birthday to you.

543
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,919
Master Kang,

544
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:17,879
this is for you.

545
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,480
Um,

546
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,560
we tried our best

547
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,159
with our limited resources.

548
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:24,919
Um,

549
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,119
we weren't able to finish

550
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,119
the most important ritual last time.

551
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,359
So we're making up for it this time.

552
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,080
Don't worry, Kang Jiawei.

553
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,439
We don't want to know

554
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,679
what happened to you that day.

555
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,439
We just want you

556
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,439
to be happy every day

557
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,439

559

560
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:56,800
Happy birthday!

561
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:26,199
Thank you.

00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,599
Thank you.

How's the taste?

564
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,639
This is the best cake

I've ever had in my life.

566
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:45,879
Did you set all of this up?

567
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,240
Are you done?

568
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:51,679
I can't hold this position any longer.

569
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,919
Be quiet and stay still.

570

571

Did you cry?

What happened?

574
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,399
Um...

575
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,240
I can't tell.

576
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,000
But

577
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
can you guys help me out?

578
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,439
Just a little.

579
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:22,399
That's too much!

580
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,199
Oh, no!

thank you.

593

595
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,199
You did it.

my memory.

598

What's more important

599

is that you remember

I have a question for you.

Why are you so nice to me?

if Xu Jingjing is being so nice to me

627
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,639

690
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,040

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,359
But 5.30am is too early.

697
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,480
Can't we do 6am?

698
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:53,439
You won't regret

699
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,399
waking up early.

700
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,040
How so?

701
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,159
Because

702
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,320
you'll get to enjoy a view

703
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,800
that none other can.

704
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,359
Early mornings here

705
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,639
are beautiful.

706
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Once you finish feeding the chickens,

707
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,679
you can climb up

708
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:06,720
the mountain
at the east end of the village

709
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,839
to catch the sunrise.

710
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:08,879
There's an observation deck up there.

711
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,960
It's famous.

712
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,960
I'll show you some of the shots

713
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,040
we took of the scenery the other day.

714
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,320
What do you think?

715
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,919
Beautiful, right?

716
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,159
It does look nice.

717
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:32,839
Gao Zhan!

718
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:35,720
Are you planning on

719
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,800
not talking to me
for the rest of your life?

720
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,439
What is there to talk about?

721
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,599
What isn't there to talk about?

722
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:47,199
I have a lot of things

723
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,000
to say to you.

724
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:48,960
Go on then.

725
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,399
What's this?

726
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,960
You're always saying

727
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,480
that my father isn't serious.

728
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,359
Well, here's evidence against that.

729
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,839
Hui,

730
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,960
my love for you

731
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,359
is like a tractor going up a hill,

732
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,800
loud and vigorous.

733
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:12,480
Hui,

734
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,080
I don't miss you a little.

735
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,240
I miss you all the time.

736
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,879
What is this?

737
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,199
No, I... I didn't ask you to read those.

738
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,240
Keep... Keep reading.

739
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,040
Not interested.

740
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:21,919
I know I'm not good with words.

741
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,599
I copied these lines.

742
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,960
But my love for you is sincere.

743
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,040
I know I'm not good enough

744
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,399
for you and Gao Zhan,

745
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:33,159
but please give me a chance.

746
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,480
I will change myself

747
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:35,599
for you two.

748
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,560
From now on,

749
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,040
I'll quit smoking and drinking.

750
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,439
I'll start watching literary films

751
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,080
and pick up reading.

752
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,159
I will prove to you

753
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,080
that I am serious.

754
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,480
I will treat Gao Zhan even better

755
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,839
than Dapeng.

756
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,119
Please believe me.

757
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,879
There's much more.

758
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,879
I'll send all of them to you.

759
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,599
Also,

760
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:55,679
to prove

761
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,720
my dad's character to you,

762
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,199
I even went through his phone

763
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,000
and computer.

764
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,240
I swear

765
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,679
that I've never seen him

766
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,199
involved with another woman.

767
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:07,800
Gao Zhan!

768
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:09,960
You think my father

769
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:10,679
is

770
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,320
a nouveau riche!

771
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
But you don't know him at all!

772
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,839
I lost my mother

773
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
when I was young.

774
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,720
To give me

775
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:25,720
a better life,

776
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,399
he never married another woman.

777
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,760
He worked hard

778
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,439
every day and night
to get to where he is today!

779
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,839
All of that

780
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
just to give me a better life!

781
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:38,639
Do you know how hard he worked

782
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,639
to raise me,

783
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,480
playing both mother and father to me?

784
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,119
To me,

785
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:48,560
he is the best dad

786
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,560
in the world.

787
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,599
I'm all grown up now.

788
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:01,599
My dad met

789
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,560
someone he loves too.

790
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,760
As his son,

791
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,359
I support him wholely.

792
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,919
Our parents are always giving us

793
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,879
the best they can,

794
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:09,879
so as their sons,

795
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,800
why can't we

796
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,599
be more considerate of them?

797
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,240
I know my dad
isn't the most educated or cultured.

798
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,599
I know

799
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,879
all of these are not reasons

800
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,679
why Madam Shi has to accept my dad.

801
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,720
But at least I can see

802
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:36,839
that he is doing everything he can

803
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,760
to prove that he is sincere.

804
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,919
At least he tried!

805
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm proud of my dad!

806
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,960
My dad is the best in the world!

807
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,820
(Property Transfer Agreement,
Equity Transfer Agreement)

808
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,319
I accidentally overheard everything.

809
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,119
Dapeng's dad

810
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,360
probably isn't a bad guy.

811
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,960
Now you can rest assured.

812
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Never mind. Let's not talk about that.

813
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,799
Let me ask you something.

814
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:54,719
How long are you going

815
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,840
to stay mad at Xu Jingjing?

816
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,319
Actually, I...

817
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Actually, you know better

818
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,040
than anyone

819
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,440
that she didn't do

820
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,520
anything wrong.

821
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:04,719
You're not bothered by the fact

822
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,560
that she told Lu Xiaobai

823
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,560
about it.

824
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,080
You're bothered

825
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,000
because you don't want others to know

826
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,520
that you went to the matchmaking agency.

827
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:16,279
Because you know

828
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,159
that what you did was wrong.

829
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,880
(Flying Fish, Alice, The Loneliest Whale,
Happy Dreams, Fiery Girl)

830
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,880
I caught you slacking off!

831
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,319
Oh, you scared me!

832
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:02,279
I...

833
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,759
It's all because of this competition.

834
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,799
I can't help

835
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,759
checking the rankings.

836
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,159
What's your ranking?

837
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,520
I'm in second place right now.

838
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,080
"Alice, the loneliest whale" is second?

839
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:12,159
That's great!

840
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:13,880
But I'm behind first place

841
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,960
by a wide margin.

842
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,719
The person in the first place
is a famous vlogger.

843
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,880
They have a lot of fans.

844
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,520
I can't win against them in a vote.

845
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,199
Don't worry.

846
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,040
I'll gather the other students

847
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,000
and have them all vote for you

848
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:22,840
and promote the video.

849
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:23,799
Wait!

850
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:25,679
How are you going to promote it?

851
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,000
I'll get everyone to vote for you.

852
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,040
That won't do.

853
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,679
I'll be doomed

854
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,040
if my mom catches wind of it.

855
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,599
Oh, I forgot...

856
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:39,000
We can ask Dapeng.

857
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,000
Dapeng bought a lot of votes

858
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,119
during his last campaign, didn't he?

859
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,080
No. That's cheating.

860
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,159
Well,

861
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:46,159
you don't know
if the others are cheating too.

862
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,920
Even so,

863
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,040
we can't be like them.

864
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,199
Well, then, you need to find a way

865
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,040
to promote yourself

866
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,520
and put yourself out there!

867

00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,639
you seem more anxious about this

869
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,840
than I am.

870
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,599
Well, I'm the director.

871
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:10,239
Oh, right.

872
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,440
I want to ask you something.

873
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,080
Both Xu Jingjing and I

874
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,719
gave you bags.

875
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,239
Why did you use hers instead of mine?

876
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,159
The one you gave me
was a limited edition bag.

877
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,199
I need to take good care of it.

878
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,920
Good guy.

879
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,440
Help me dig up the potatoes then.

880
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,239
Sure.

881
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,799
Are you all right?

882
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,960
Why did you leave that over here?

883
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
You can't just pull them out
from the ground!

884
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,400
You need to use this.

885
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,360
I'll teach you.

886
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,159
Say, when these loquats are ripe,

887
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,920
- can you play them?
- Are you an idiot?

888
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:48,799
Loquats are for eating,

889
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,560
not for playing.

890
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,520
You fool!

891
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:51,560
Can't you realise

892
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:52,360
that I was trying to make Jiayao laugh?

893
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,440
I'll hit you with this shovel.

894
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,199
I've got it!

895
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,440
Got what?

896
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,360
Here's your chance to repay me.

897
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,360
Gao.

898
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,279
Gao!

899
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:16,279
What?

900
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
Are you going to lecture me again?

901
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,840
No.

902
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,920
Did you know

903
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,840
that there's a mountain
in the east of the village?

904
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,920
Yes.

905
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,520
There's even an observation deck
on the mountain.

906
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:27,679
What about it?

907
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,599
I looked it up.

908
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,119
It's a popular spot to take photos.

909
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,799
The sunrise view is gorgeous up there.

910
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:32,279
Do you want

911
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,159
to catch the sunrise with me?

912
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:34,639
No.

913
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,520
Did you want me to go with you

914
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,520
to see the sunrise?

915
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,719
But I think that's boring.

916
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,480
We would be sleepy and cold

917
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,679
and have to wait a long time.

918
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:47,719
I might as well

919
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,840
read another few books with that time.

920
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
I'm going out for a run.

921
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,239
Come on! Let's go!

922
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,319
The instructor
will be doing the rounds soon.

923
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,159
Stop dallying.

924
00:38:58,799 --> 00:38:59,679
I don't want to go ghost-hunting.

925
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,679
If you guys want to go,
go by yourselves.

926
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,639
Don't be afraid, Xiaobai.

927
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,639
I'll protect you.

928
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:05,880
Let's go.

929
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:07,560
It sounds fun.

930
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,000
Jingjing,

931
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:09,960
come with us?

932
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,560
I... I'll pass.

933
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:12,639
I have something to do later.

934
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,159
Fine.

935
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:14,560
Let's go.

936
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,400
Come on.

937
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,480
We're off, then.

938
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,279
Be safe!

939
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,080
I knew I could count on Jiayao.

940
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,599
Lights out. Go to bed, everyone.

941
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:36,319
No way!

942
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,159
How am I supposed
to put on makeup in the dark?

943
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,840
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

944
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,159
Why are we back here again?

945
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:50,520
Is this

946
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,719
what they call running

947
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,679
into a ghost wall?

948
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,000
Don't scare me like that!

949
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:57,880
If you do that again, I'm going back!

950
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,080
All right, all right.

951
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,279
I won't mess around anymore.

952
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,159
I'll use my phone to navigate us.

953
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,080
That'll get us to the place.

954
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:03,840
Come on.

955
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,880
I... I'm getting scared.

956
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,279
Why don't we head back?

957
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,159
Don't.

958
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:18,279
Dapeng,

959
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,000
are you sure this is the right way?

960
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:20,920
I...

961
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
This is the right direction.

962
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,560
Wait.

963
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,560
I think I heard

964
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,159
a woman's voice.

965
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,159
Don't scare me.

966
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,000
I think I heard it too.

967
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,759
Right?

968
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,799
Turn on the flashlights.

969
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,239
Come on.

970
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,880
