(The Sunrise at the Age of Seventeen)

16
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,722
I'm a little scared.

17
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,082
Why don't we go back?

18
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,162
Don't.

19
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,242
Dapeng,

20
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:55,722
are you sure this is the right way?

21
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:56,722
I... I...

22
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:57,843
It's in this direction.

23
00:01:57,963 --> 00:01:58,763
I'm sure.

24
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:01,362
Why isn't Gao Zhan here yet?

25
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:03,362
Does he stand me up again?

26
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:05,642
Wait.

27
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:08,642
Why would I hear

28
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,043
a woman's voice?

29
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:11,203
Don't scare me.

30
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:12,802
I seem to hear it too.

31
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:13,443
Right?

32
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:16,562
Turn on the torchlight.

33
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:19,802
Right.

34
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,483
I'll wait a little longer.

35
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:34,842
Do I look good?

36
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:37,483
Ghost!

37
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,283
Ghost!

38
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:45,603
There's a ghost!

39
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:47,283
Run! There's a ghost!

40
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:52,842
Bring it on, where are you?

41
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,082
Well.

42
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:56,122
Isn't this Xu Jingjing?

43
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:01,242
Jingjing, what's wrong with your face?

44
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:03,723
What?

45
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,163
See for yourself.

46
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:06,402
She's almost...

47
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:07,003
Enough.

48
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,043
Oh my god!

49
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,242
Here's a wet tissue. Wipe it off.

50
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:10,723
No.

51
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:14,122
Here... here's the thing.

52
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:15,522
Xu Jingjing asked me to watch

53
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:16,802
the sunrise with her.

54
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:17,723
Well, we must take

55
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,242
a photo while watching the sunrise.

56
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:19,923
She asked me to do it.

57
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:21,802
She got to put on make-up for the photo.

58
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:23,962
Right.

59
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:25,483
I was going to watch the sunrise today

60
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:26,562
so I put on some make-up.

61
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:27,362
Then, why didn't

62
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:28,522
you tell me that?

63
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,323
Didn't you already leave?

64
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:31,842
Kang Jiawei,

65
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,842
come over here.

66
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:35,043
You guys talk first.

67
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:44,402
Where is Gao Zhan?

68
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,122
Gao... Gao Zhan said something came up.

69
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:48,122
He's not coming.

70
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:50,443
What... What does it mean?

71
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:51,802
Which means I'll...

72
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,723
We'll watch

73
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,043
the sunrise with you.

74
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,003
You know what?

75
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:56,962
The point of watching the sunrise

76
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:58,842
is not about the sunrise itself

77
00:03:58,962 --> 00:03:59,883
but the person who watches it with you.

78
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:00,562
Enough.

79
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:02,562
I don't want to watch it
with you either, okay?

80
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:03,923
This is just to repay your kindness.

81
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:07,723
Gao Zhan.

82
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,163
I...

83
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:11,723
Dates before mates.

84
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,322
You're all going to watch the sunrise?

85
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:18,843
It's a good idea.

86
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,562
Don't go on an adventure,
it's too scary.

87
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,322
Why?

88
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,442
I've studied the routes.

89
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,882
What's so special about the sunrise?

90
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:24,923
I'd like to watch the sunrise too.

91
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,762
Count me in.

92
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:29,762
We got here just in the nick of time.

93
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:30,362
Let's go together.

94
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:31,202
Come on.

95
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,202
Let's go.

96
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:32,723
Let's go.

97
00:04:32,843 --> 00:04:33,362
Let's go.

98
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,483
Look.

99
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:38,643
There are many people.

100
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,403
But it's kind of watching

101
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,682
the sunrise with Gao Zhan indirectly.

102
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,643
Can you be patient?

103
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:45,483
Geez.

104
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:56,083
You run so fast.

105
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,242
Xiaobai, I need to use the toilet.

106
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,043
Let's return to the base first.

107
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:02,682
I can't hold it any longer.

108
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:03,643
I'm not going.

109
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,643
There might be a ghost in there.

110
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,963
Stop it. The more you say,
the scarier it gets.

111
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,002
There's no ghost in the world.

112
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:13,682
Is anyone there?

113
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:15,762
Gao Zhan.

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
(Female Male)

115
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,322
I've checked it, it's safe.

116
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:20,043
Go on.

117
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:20,843
I'll wait for you out here.

118
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,682
Then, I'll leave Jingjing to you.

119
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:23,762
Lu Xiaobai.

120
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:28,202
Thank you.

121
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,603
Xu Jingjing,

122
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:38,083
tell me when you're done.

123
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:39,362
Well,

124
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:41,362
Gao Zhan.

125
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:42,603
Yes?

126
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,603
Why don't you go walk around?

127
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:47,483
You want me to walk around?

128
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:51,202
Or you can cover your ears.

129
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:53,362
I got it.

130
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:54,483
Are you worried I'd hear

131
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:55,643
the sound of you using the toilet?

132
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,682
No, don't say it out.

133
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,002
I've covered my ears.

134
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:04,043
The late emperor was taken from us

135
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:05,403
before he could finish his life's work.

136
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:07,362
Today, the empire is still

137
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:08,682
divided in three.

138
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,122
Our very survival is threatened.

139
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:13,963
Yet still the officials at court
and the soldiers

140
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:16,802
throughout the realm remain loyal
to Your Majesty.

141
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,242
Because they remember the late emperor,

142
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:21,322
they wish to repay
His Majesty's kindness.

143
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:24,603
Well.

144
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,122
Thank you

145
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:27,362
for waiting for me outside the toilet.

146
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,002
Actually, I'd like to say sorry

147
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:35,122
to you.

148
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,122
Kang Jiawei was right.

149
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:38,562
I was mad

150
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:39,643
because I knew

151
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:40,802
it was my fault.

152
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,002
Kang Jiawei?

153
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:45,762
He scolded me.

154
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,762
Why is he so nosy?

155
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:50,723
He's annoying.

156
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:55,802
Sorry.

157
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,442
I shouldn't have vented my anger on you.

158
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,562
It's alright.

159
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:01,562
As long as

160
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:02,723
you've come around.

161
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,043
I thought

162
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,483
you'd forever ignore me.

163
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:08,403
By the way,

164
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,963
how's thing going
between you and Dapeng?

165
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,442
He showed me

166
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,202
the conversation
between his dad and my mum.

167
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,362
I guess

168
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,002
his dad is serious about it.

169
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:17,882
Look, I told you

170
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,242
that his dad is a good guy.

171
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:20,923
Then, have you accepted his dad?

172
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,762
I want to think about it.

173
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:28,843
Let me tell you this.

174
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,483
I'll take Dapeng's side.

175
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:31,843
At least he tries it.

176
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:32,723
What about you?

177
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:34,083

We finally make it to the top!

181
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,562
- Good!
- Great!

182
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:09,643
It's breathtaking.

183
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,523
It's very beautiful!

184
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,083
Look, Jingjing.

185
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:18,762
It's very beautiful.

186
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:23,242
It looks nice.

187
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:24,562
The stars in the city are not that much.

188
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,083

189
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:29,283

00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:33,682
I'm very handsome.

193
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,163
And I know...

194
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,243
Enough.

195
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,602
Stop making noise.

196
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:38,883

197
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:41,082
Stop shouting. Stop shouting.

Do not call me Jiayao.

201
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:53,202
Then, what should I call you?

202
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:54,322
I'll call you

203
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,163

252
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:12,082
who's been chatting with me online.

253
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:13,243
(It's not right.)

254
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:15,082
(How could she be Give-up Virtuoso?)

255
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,003
What's wrong?

256
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:31,043
Last time when you asked to meet me,

257
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:32,763
why was it Gao Zhan that I met

258
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,003
in the coffee shop?

259
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,202
So,

260
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,883
you did show up

261
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:42,123
for the appointment?

262
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,163
No wonder I didn't see you.

263
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:48,682
That day,

264
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,442
that day, Gao Zhan happened

265
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,082
to be at that coffee shop too.

266
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,043
I ran into him

267
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,643
and we've chatted.

268
00:11:58,763 --> 00:12:00,363
When you reached there,

269
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,202
it happened

270
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,442
that I went to the washroom.

271
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,883
That's why you only saw Gao Zhan.

272
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:12,363
Really?

273
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:17,163
Did you mistake

274
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:18,363
Gao Zhan as the online friend?

275
00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:21,842
Stop chatting.

276
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:23,123
Dapeng is going to tell ghost stories.

277
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:23,722
Let's go.

278
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:24,482
Come.

279
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,163
Let's go together.

280
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:35,082
Last time, we were talking

281
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,602
about a woman in white,

282
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,322
she always wandered in the street

283
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,602
in the dark night.

284
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,202
When she asked

285
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:45,962
if she looked good,

286
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,243
you must not answer her.

287
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,082
If you answered her,

288
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,562
she'd open

289
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,163
her cavernous mouth

290
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:54,082
and teleport to your face

291
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:56,403
and said

292
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:58,322
"would you like to buy cosmetics?"

293
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,243
Nonsense.

294
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:03,363
Isn't it funny?

295
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,003
I was worried you might be scared.

296
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,283
So I made some modification.

297
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:07,243
I'll tell you another story.

298
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,682
- Big news.
- Big news.

299
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,082
You go first.

300
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,403
Gao Zhan apologised to me just now.

301
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:14,923
And he said you were the wingman.

302
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,363
Small case.

303
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,163
What about you?

304
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:20,682
That online friend of mine on Douban

305
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:21,523
is not Gao Zhan.

306
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,523
It's Xu Jingjing.

307
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:24,962
Don't be afraid.

308
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,123
It's not yet the gory part.

309
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:27,283
Go on.

310
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:29,682
No.

311
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:31,322
Didn't you already

312
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,523
exclude Xu Jingjing?

313
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:33,482
Moreover,

314
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:34,523
about your last meeting...

315
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:35,243
I've asked her about it.

316
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,643
She said Gao Zhan happened to show up

317
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:38,602
at the coffee shop that day.

318
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:39,962
That's why I got the wrong idea.

319
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:43,403
Gao Zhan went to the coffee shop?

320
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,003
I remember you said

321
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:46,322
he doesn't drink coffee.

322
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,763
The coffee shop doesn't
only sell coffee.

323
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:51,763
Perhaps it got his favourite

324
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:53,163
Red Bean Matcha Milk Tea

325
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:54,562
or Fruit Tea.

326
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:55,602
Maybe he's developed

327
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,722
a taste for coffee.

328
00:13:58,883 --> 00:13:59,322
Is this written

329
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,322
on that stalker notebook of yours?

330
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,082
What do you mean by stalker notebook?

331
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:02,962
It is

332
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,163
to know more about him.

333
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:10,923
Anyway, I think it was

334
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,962
quite a coincidence
that Gao Zhan suddenly showed up

335
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:14,842
at the coffee shop.

336
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,123
Was it?

337
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:18,643
I always ran into someone

338
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:19,763
I knew in the street.

339
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:21,403
No.

340
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,082
Why do you keep suspecting Gao Zhan?

341
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:24,682
The crux of the matter is

342
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,802
that Xu Jingjing is the online friend.

343
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,082
Now's your chance, Kang Jiawei.

344
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,363
Are we there yet?

345
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:40,322
I'm exhausted.

346
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:41,243
We're almost there.

347
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:43,403
It's worth the tiredness

348
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:44,562
to hike the mountain with you.

349
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:49,082
I'm saying

350
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,123
you'll find it worthy

351
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:51,403
at the moment when you see

352
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,082
the sun rise.

353
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:57,962
Got it? He found a fly in it

354
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,523
when he was eating it.

355
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:00,962
Aren't they our class's kids?

356
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:01,763
Yes.

357
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:02,842
Just then,

358
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:03,802
no sooner said than done,

359
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:05,283
the Heibai Wuchang suddenly...

360
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:06,322
The Heibai Wuchang!

361
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,202
The Heibai Wuchang!

362
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:08,962
Why aren't you sleeping?

363
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,163
What are you doing here?

364
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:11,523
Ms. Chen, Mr. Zhao

365
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:12,802
Why are you here?

366
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,283
I...

367
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,243
Ms. Chen

368
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,243
found nobody at the dorm.

369
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:23,363
So she asked me to come

370
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:24,202
and catch you with her.

371
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:24,883
To catch you guys.

372
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:26,243
It's not right.

373
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:27,202
How did you know

374
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,123
that we're here?

375
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:29,602
Or did you have a date

376
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,003
to watch the sunrise here?

377
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:35,123
Stop it.

378
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:36,842
Don't mess around.
Go down the hill, hurry up.

379
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:37,682
Go back to sleep.

380
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:39,202
No.

381
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:41,163
I was exhausted
while coming up the hill.

382
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,602
We've never watched the sunrise before.

383
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,602
I really like to watch it.

384
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:44,682
Yes, Ms. Chen.

385
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:45,523
It's not easy

386
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:46,643
for us to get together.

387
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,682
Just let us watch it this once.

388
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,962
- Ms. Chen.
- Ms. Chen.

389
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,923
Just let them watch it.

390
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:54,923
It's dark now.

391
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:55,962
It's hard to walk back down.

392
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:56,802
Yes.

393
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:57,923
I have night blindness.

394
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,082
I can't see things clearly.

395
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:00,482
Yes, I'm nearsighted with 80 diopters.

396
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:01,442
I'm like a blind man.

397
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,043
You can't watch the sunrise then.

398
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:04,682
Ms. Chen.

399
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:06,842
Ms. Chen.

400
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:09,123
Ms. Chen.

401
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,682
Fine, just watch it.

402
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:11,682
You look pitiful.

403
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,562
But, I've got a request.

404
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:15,363
When we go back,

405
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,923
each of you needs to write me an article

406
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:18,923
about the experience
of watching the sunrise.

407
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:19,602
- Okay.
- Sure.

408
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:20,842
- Okay.
- Ms. Chen,

409
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:22,763
it's not safe to let the kids

410
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:23,523
stay here alone.

411
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,123
Why don't we watch the sunrise

412
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:26,442
with them?

413
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:34,802
Okay, then.

414
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,562
Stop heckling.

415
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:55,643
Guys.

416
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:56,643
The sun is rising.

417
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,562
Stop sleeping, wake up.

418
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:58,082
Wake up.

419
00:16:59,082 --> 00:16:59,763
Xiaobai, Xiaobai.

420
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:00,923
Jingjing.

421
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:01,763
What is this place?

422
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:03,923
Hurry up.

423
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:04,803
The sun has risen.

424
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:05,363
You've arrived.

425
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:07,163
Gosh, look at you.

426
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,123
Isn't it beautiful?

427
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:19,202
Yes, it is.

428
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:20,603
So this is the sunrise.

429
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:27,682
It's very beautiful.

430
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:36,883
It's quite nice.

431
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:41,682
Kang Jiawei,

432
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,403
let's take a photo together.

433
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:44,843
Okay.

434
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,923
Why don't we take a photo together?

435
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:51,923
Sure.

436
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:13,363
Yaoyao, let's take a photo with me.

437
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:14,363
I'll go.

438
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,403
Come here. Come here.

439
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,442
Gao Zhan has something to tell you.

440
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,202
Good morning, Dapeng.

441
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:39,442
Morning.

442
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,323
Is that all?

443
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:00,442
We're friends again!

444
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:02,323
Bro!

445
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:07,042
Gao Zhan and I become bros again!

446
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:08,643
Guys,

447
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:10,323
let's take a photo together.

448
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:11,643
I'll take it for you, come.

449
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:12,163
Okay.

450
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:12,962
Come on.

451
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,323
Come here.

452
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:20,643
Coming.

453
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:22,843
Come, look over here.

454
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:24,042
Three.

455
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,042
Two.

456
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:26,363
One.

457
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,843
We haven't finished
our discussion yesterday.

458
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:56,282
No, don't you think it was strange

459
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:56,962
that Gao Zhan

460
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:57,803
suddenly showed up

461
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:58,803
at the coffee shop?

462
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,563
I think you're the strange one.

463
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:03,202
Xu Jingjing didn't even

464
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:04,442
look at you back then.

465
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,323
Now that she

466
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:06,843
asked to take a photo with you.

467
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,883
Yet, you're being suspicious.

468
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:10,042
No.

469
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:12,042
Mainly because it doesn't make
any sense.

470
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:13,722
If she was

471
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:14,762
Give-up Virtuoso,

472
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:15,643
there were many memes

473
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,843
that we chatted online before.

474
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:17,923
But she couldn't get it.

475
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:20,042
Are you sure it was something

476
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:20,803
that you've chatted before?

477
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:21,762
I'm sure.

478
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:23,083
Did you forget

479
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:24,242
the Chandler's meme
that I told you?

480
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:26,083
And the Battle Angel Alita.

481
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:27,563
What's wrong with that?

482
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,242
She had uploaded the poster

483
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:31,202
of the Battle Angel Alita
on her Douban's photo album before.

484
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:32,722
When we were shooting,

485
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:33,482
I told her

486
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:34,843
that her outfit looked like Alita's.

487
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:35,762
She didn't get

488
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:36,843
what I meant.

489
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:38,202
I think

490
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:39,403
she doesn't even know who Alita is.

491
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,083
She might've

492
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:41,962
just thought

493
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,603
that the poster looked nice.

494
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:50,603
Come, let's eat.

495
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:56,403
The more I look at you,

496
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,563
the more I think you look like Dapeng.

497
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,323
Stop insulting it.

498
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:01,042
Dapeng is not as good-looking as it is.

499
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:02,883
Here.

500
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,923
Thank you, I don't drink coffee.

501
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:05,883
I have caffeine intolerance.

502
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:06,883
You drink it.

503
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,002
Do you need something?

504
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:15,962
No.

505
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,083
I'm here to pet the dog.

506
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:27,843
By the way,

507
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,202
I heard that you've made up with Dapeng.

508
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:32,962
My mum even called

509
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:33,722
and asked me

510
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:34,762
when I'll return home.

511
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:35,563
I told her

512
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:36,603
I'll go home after learning to farm.

513
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:37,722
What's the rush?

514
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,083
Just stay a little longer.

515
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:43,643
I didn't know

516
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,883
you don't drink coffee.

517
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,323
Then, you usually don't go
to coffee shop?

518
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,482
Basically, I don't go there.

519
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:52,002
Then, I heard from Xu Jingjing

520
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:54,522
that she met you at the coffee shop.

521
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:55,722
She met me?

522
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,442
Yes, it was two weeks ago.

523
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:01,843
It wasn't a chance meeting.

524
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,482
She said a netizen asked to meet her.

525
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:04,603
And it was a boy.

526
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:07,962
Are you alright?

527
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:09,363
I'm fine.

528
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:10,722
Go on.

529
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:11,163
Okay.

530
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:14,522
She was afraid it might be related
with that stalker.

531
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:15,962
So she asked me to go there with her.

532
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,202
She said it was

533
00:22:19,843 --> 00:22:21,522
that male netizen who asked her out.

534
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,682
What's wrong?

535
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,843
That day, Gao Zhan happened

536
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:27,803
to be at the coffee shop.

537
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:29,482
I ran into him

538
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:31,002
and we've chatted.

539
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:32,962
Nothing.

540
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:33,923
Well...

541
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,643
I... I haven't finished digging
the potatoes.

542
00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:38,163
I... I'll go dig the potatoes first.

543
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:39,923
Okay.

544
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:44,242
Tonight, you'll be able to witness

545
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:45,363
the birth of the chicks.

546
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:46,803
That's great.

547
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:47,403
Tonight,

548
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:48,682
I'll be able to meet

549
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:49,843
my baby chicks.

550
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:51,682
Congratulations, Hen.

551
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,403
This is its first time being a mother.

552
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:54,442
Then, this is the first egg

553
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:55,442
I protect.

554
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,962
I've got a feeling

555
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,323
of being a mother now.

556
00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,563
I'm a bit nervous.

557
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:04,682
Coach,

558
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:07,962
wait till it hatches into a chick,

559
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:10,242
what will happen
after the chick grows up?

560
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,603
It'll be sold to the market.

561
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:14,123
Then, it'll be eaten?

562
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:14,803
Yes.

563
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,163
That's too cruel.

564
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:17,442
Then, why don't you think

565
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,722
it's cruel when you eat fried chicken?

566
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:20,442
That's different.

567
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:22,042
That's not the chick I take care of.

568
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,722
Coach,

569
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,603
after it hatches into a chick,

570
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:30,282
can I buy it?

571
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:31,282
Sure.

572
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:32,923
If you like it,

573
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:34,242
I'll give you

574
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:35,202
the first hatched chick.

575
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:36,522
Thank you, Coach.

576
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:39,843
I'll count on you.

577
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:41,002
Fight on.

578
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,083
Let me tell you this.

579
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:47,242
I'll never eat

580
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,722
fried chicken, roast chicken

581
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:49,843
or McSpicy Chicken Filet Burger

582
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,282
with you guys again.

583
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,002
Then, why is your mouth watering?

584
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,522
Are you really going to take
the chick back?

585
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:58,522
Of course.

586
00:23:58,883 --> 00:23:59,883
I'll never let them

587
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:01,202
be human's food.

588
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:02,522
You already got dog in your house.

589
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,042
Will your mum allow you
to keep the chick?

590
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:05,123
This time,

591
00:24:05,282 --> 00:24:06,563
I'll move first
before asking for permission.

592
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:07,843
I'll bring it back home first.

593
00:24:07,883 --> 00:24:09,123
My mum can't help but to accept it.

594
00:24:12,643 --> 00:24:13,563
What is that smell?

595
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:14,883
It smells good.

596
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:18,563
There's smoke over there.

597
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:20,603
Let's go check it out.

598
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:25,803
Master Kang,

599
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:27,722
will Coach find out

600
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,803
that the potatoes are missing?

601
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:29,843
Look at Xiong Shuai.

602
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:31,603
His taros are a lot less.

603
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:32,363
Just eat it, it's fine.

604
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,843
It tastes better than the taros

605
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:34,403
my family sells.

606
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,042
Right?

607
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:37,042
The three of you

608
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:38,202
eat alone here.

609
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,522
Why are you here?

610
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:41,883
Xiaobai, quickly take a photo.

611
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:42,522
Let's report them.

612
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,282
Wait. Wait.

613
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:46,522
Well, Xu Jingjing, how about this?

614
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:47,603
You... you try this taro.

615
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:48,442
You can consider

616
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:50,563
if you want to report us
after trying it.

617
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:50,923
Okay?

618
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:51,603
Yes.

619
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:52,363
Try it.

620
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:57,482
Delete the photo.

621
00:24:58,323 --> 00:24:59,363
My favourite

622
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:00,682
baked sweet potato.

623
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:01,442
Here, Yaoyao.

624
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,123
Try the potato I baked for you.

625
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:03,923
It's delicious.

626
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,242
I think you look like a potato.

627
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:09,202
Do I look like a potato?

628
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:09,803
No.

629
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:10,843
You don't.

630
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:12,442
Gao Zhan said you look

631
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:13,843
like the dog he keeps.

632
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:17,522
Is that a compliment?

633
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,482
You can think it that way.

634
00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:26,002
Come, I need to tell you something.

635
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,722
I haven't eaten yet.

636
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:28,682
Hurry up, quick.

637
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:31,843
What did you say?

638
00:25:32,403 --> 00:25:34,123
Xu Jingjing asked Gao Zhan out?

639
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:36,163
Gao Zhan said a netizen asked
to meet her.

640
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:37,242
Xu Jingjing was afraid
he was a bad guy.

641
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:38,522
So he asked Gao Zhan
to go there with her.

642
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:40,202
This is understandable.

643
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:41,603
Didn't she meet

644
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:42,163
a pervert before?

645
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,083
It's good to be more cautious.

646
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:46,682
But it was Xu Jingjing who asked me out.

647
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:48,923
She asked me out.

648
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:49,643
I didn't ask her out.

649
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:51,002
Why would she lie to him?

650
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:51,762
Wait.

651
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:54,722
Xu Jingjing asked to meet you.

652
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:57,282
Then you saw Gao Zhan.

653
00:25:58,442 --> 00:25:58,843
No.

654
00:25:59,002 --> 00:25:59,762
What kind of nonsense is that?

655
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:01,722
Whoever you meet,
isn't it the same?

656
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:03,762
Don't think too much.

657
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:04,242
Anyway,

658
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:05,202
you've recognised each other.

659
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,042
Baby chick, I'm here to see...

660
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:47,002
No way.

661
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,083
Where is my egg?

662
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,560
(Baby Chick)

663
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:29,923
Baby chick,

664
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:32,323
rest in peace.

665
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:34,363
No one

666
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:36,282
will turn you into

667
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:37,123
fried chicken,

668
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:38,242
roast chicken,

669
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,202
McSpicy Chicken Filet Burger
in heaven.

670
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:40,722
Jingjing,

671
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:42,363
it's time for assembly.

672
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:54,522
You're here

673
00:27:54,722 --> 00:27:55,682
just for a few short days.

674
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:56,722
But,

675
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:58,042
I believe that

676
00:27:58,202 --> 00:27:58,962
it has left you

677
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:00,242
a precious memory.

678
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,282
I hope you won't forget
what you've experienced

679
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:03,323
these few days.

680
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:04,762
And don't forget

681
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:06,923
the happiness
that physical labour brings us.

682
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:08,042
Thank you.

683
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:27,643
Jingjing.

684
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:30,522
Jingjing.

685
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:34,722
Are you alright?

686
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:37,883
I'm fine.

687
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,163
I was thinking

688
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:40,843
about that baby chick I raised.

689
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:42,563
If you really want to raise it,

690
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:43,522
I can buy one for you.

691
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,163
All I wanted

692
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,323
was the one that I took care of.

693
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,002
It was special to me.

694
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:52,682
Maybe it was taken away by a weasel.

695
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:54,323
There was a weasel?

696
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:55,762
Didn't you say there was

697
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:57,002
a broken eggshell in the henhouse?

698
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:57,883
In my opinion,

699
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:58,923
the weasel dropped it

700
00:28:59,042 --> 00:28:59,563
while eating it.

701
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:00,403
Kang Jiawei,

702
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,163
just shut up
if you're not good at words.

703
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:04,603
Wise men are silent.

704
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:08,682
It's possible

705
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:09,762
that it wanted to raise its own child

706
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:11,202
so it hid the egg.

707
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:11,843
Right.

708
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:12,762
It's also possible

709
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:13,762
that the chick ran away

710
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:14,603
after it hatched.

711
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:15,722
Yes.

712
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:16,962
Stop talking about it.

713
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:31,643
I'm back.

714
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:33,282
Jingjing, you're back.

715
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,242
Let me take a look, did you lose weight?

716
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:37,603
You lost weight. Here, give me the bag.

717
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:40,202
What's wrong?

718
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:42,202
Why are you so down?

719
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:43,762
I... I'm not feeling very well.

720
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:44,643
I want to sleep.

721
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:46,042
Come, let me check on you.

722
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:49,242
Why do you feel unwell?

723
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:52,482
You have a mild fever.

724
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:54,522
I'll go get the thermometer.

725
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:13,962
Are you still mad at me?

726
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:15,242
No.

727
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:19,363
By the way,

728
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:21,403
is it interesting to learn farming?

729
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:23,643
So so.

730
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:25,403
Well,

731
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:27,482
it was quite fun some time ago.

732
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:28,682
Someone gave my information

733
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:30,323
to a place called

734
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,442
dating agency.

735
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:35,083
I've received many phone calls.

736
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:36,083
To be honest,

737
00:30:36,522 --> 00:30:38,762
there are several men
who are quite nice.

738
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,803
Why don't you give me some suggestion?

739
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:45,282
Mum,

740
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,403
how did you meet

741
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:48,603
Dapeng's dad?

742
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:55,803
Do you really want to know it?

743
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,620
(Incoming call Jin)

744
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:09,563
Jin,

745
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,722
why do you call me?

746
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:13,242
Where are you?

747
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:14,522
I'm on the way

748
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:15,883
to the parent-teacher Meeting.

749
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:16,803
What's up?

750
00:31:17,123 --> 00:31:18,923
The guy who got Gao killed has just been

751
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:20,123
brought to justice.

752
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:26,442
Hello?

753
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:28,042
Xiaohui, are you listening?

754
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:29,923
Hello?

755
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:31,762
Hello?

756
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:37,603
What's gotten into you?

757
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,603
How can you drive like this?

758
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:40,482
It's dangerous

759
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:41,843
to stop the car like this
on a rainy day.

760
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:42,682
Roll down the window.

761
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:43,843
Sorry.

762
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,323
Sorry.

763
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,482
Don't cry. Don't cry.

764
00:31:47,643 --> 00:31:48,603
No offense.

765
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:49,962
I was worried
you'd get into an accident.

766
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:50,722
Well, you...

767
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,442
Just take it out and you'll be fine.

768
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:53,883
Everyone has moments when they feel sad.

769
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:54,803
Quickly roll up the window.

770
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:55,803
Or the water will get in there. Quick.

771
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,083
Roll... Roll up.

772
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,123
Roll up, right, okay.

773
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:00,962
I... I'll take care of it.

774
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:21,042
Since then,

775
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:23,042
your Uncle Ni and I are

776
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:23,923
kind of friends.

777
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,682
Then, he will often ask

778
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:29,563
me out for meals.

779
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:35,403
I know.

780
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:37,722
I know he's not a bad guy.

781
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:39,883
Is it just because

782
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,042
he likes to help others?

783
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:46,002
Do you know

784
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:48,363
how old I am?

785
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:50,242
Fourty three.

786
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:52,123
Yes.

787
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,002
I'm already 43 years old.

788
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,083
Do you know

789
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,202
what it means

790
00:32:58,363 --> 00:32:59,442
to a woman?

791
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:02,682
At my age,

792
00:33:03,603 --> 00:33:05,163
everything has settled down

793
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,722
in life.

794
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,643
I have my own living habits,

795
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,682
the books that I prefer,

796
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,002
fixed memories.

797
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:17,482
Or maybe I'm waiting

798
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:18,762
for a stable future.

799
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:23,042
Even going to a new restaurant

800
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:25,083
to order a dish

801
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,163
that I've never tried,

802
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:27,603
it's a kind of adventure

803
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:29,002
to me.

804
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:32,163
But this year,

805
00:33:32,603 --> 00:33:34,242
everything has changed.

806
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:36,482
I seem

807
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:38,442
to have found my old self.

808
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:40,202
Really?

809
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:46,923
Then, will you marry him?

810
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:48,762
I know

811
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:51,163
no one

812
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:52,803
can take

813
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:54,442
your dad's place in your heart.

814
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:56,123
Same goes to me.

815
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:58,643
Whether this person

816
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,163
is Uncle Ni

817
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:01,962
or someone else,

818
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:04,163
if you

819
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:05,962
don't genuinely accept him,

820
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:08,642
I won't think
of getting married with him.

821
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:20,803
Let's have a meal

822
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:22,122
with Uncle Ni after some time.

823
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:24,243
You can talk with him.

824
00:34:25,283 --> 00:34:26,522
Just take it as making a friend.

825
00:34:35,162 --> 00:34:36,243
Here, have a piece of meat.

826
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,562
What's wrong with Xu Jingjing?

827
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,323
Why isn't she here yet?

828
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,562
Is it because

829
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:01,962
she's still sad about the chick?

830
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,122
Be quiet.

831
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,642
Read "My First Visit to the Red Cliff"
during morning reading.

832
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:12,002
We'll have a dictation later.

833
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:13,923
Ms. Chen,

834
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:15,683
Culture and Art Festival is
around the corner.

835
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:16,243
This is our

836
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:17,522
last Culture and Art Festival.

837
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:18,363
What has it got

838
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:19,562
to do with the dictation?

839
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:20,843
No.

840
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:22,243
I know

841
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:24,442
this is your last

842
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:25,843
Culture and Art Festival in high school.

843
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:27,283
Students who are club members

844
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:28,723
must've wanted to perform well

845
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:30,162
during the Culture and Art Festival.

846
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:31,363
As your class teacher,

847
00:35:31,803 --> 00:35:32,923
I support you guys.

848
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:35,042
However,

849
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:39,243
this is the last semester

850
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:39,803
before

851
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:40,962
you become high school seniors.

852
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:42,482
You can't forget about your study.

853
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:43,403
Got it?

854
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:44,923
Yes.

855
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:45,763
By the way,

856
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:47,562
I got to remind you all

857
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:49,763
to take care of your health.

858
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:51,042
Work and rest properly.

859
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,082
Don't be like Xu Jingjing.

860
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:54,843
She got pneumonia after returning
from learning to farm.

861
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:55,962
She even needs to be hospitalised.

862
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:57,403
It's troublesome.

863
00:35:57,562 --> 00:35:58,363
Isn't it?

864
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:00,522
Well, memorise it.

865
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:01,962
Open your book.

866
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,042
How did Xu Jingjing get pneumonia?

867
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:07,002
I already found

868
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,522
that she looked spiritless yesterday.

869
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:09,283
It must be

870
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:10,562
because of the egg.

871
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:11,763
Besides, she got wet from the rain.

872
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:13,803
It was the egg's fault.

873
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:19,803
No way.

874
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:21,323
You can't quit.

875
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:24,122
It's alright.

876
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,602
You can still perform

877
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:26,602
the show you want.

878
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:27,803
But you're the captain.

879
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,082
And you're the choreographer.

880
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:29,923
If you quit,

881
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,442
how are we going to do the performance?

882
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:35,403
I...

883
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,243
Kang Jiawei.

884
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:40,122
Kang Jiawei.

885
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,442
I need to talk to you.

886
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,002
I'll let you guys talk.

887
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:44,962
I'm leaving.

888
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:47,403
What is it?

889
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:49,642
Our music video won the first place
in the contest.

890
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:50,442
First...

891
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,283
We really won the first place?

892
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:53,363
Congratulations.

893
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,403
The website might often put

894
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:57,283
my video on the first page
in the future.

895
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:58,522
If you become famous,

896
00:36:58,723 --> 00:36:59,203
do not forget

897
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:00,403
about me, the director.

898
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,363
I dare not to be famous.

899
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:04,482
Right.

900
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:05,723
By the way,

901
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,162
what did Wei Xue tell you just now?

902
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:09,002
Why did she look worried?

903
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:12,642
I told Wei Xue

904
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:13,323
that I don't want

905
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,843
to join the cheerleading performance.

906
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,002
I...

907
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:18,763
I know this is

908
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:19,683
an irresponsible act.

909
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,122
Then, what do you want to perform?

910
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:25,283
Anyway, I just don't want to do

911
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:26,403
cheerleading dance anymore.

912
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:27,642
This is our last

913
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:29,283
Culture and Art Festival in high school.

914
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:36,363
You want to be Alice,
the loneliest whale?

915
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:39,162
Sure.

916
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,323
It's okay to be yourself.

917
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:41,203
I support you.

918
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:42,162
You know

919
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:43,602
that we can invite our parents

920
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,363
to Culture and Art Festival's show
in our school.

921
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,283
I want to show my mum

922
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:47,883
what I'm really good at

923
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,283
and the thing I like.

924
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,363
Then, you can

925
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,962
talk to your teammates.

926
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:53,883
See if you can

927
00:37:54,082 --> 00:37:55,683
switch the cheerleading dance
to street dance.

928
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:58,683
I've thought that before.

929
00:37:59,042 --> 00:37:59,642
But I don't know

930
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:00,723
how to tell them that.

931
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:01,962
Only a few of you

932
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,363
have seen me doing street dances.

933
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,323
Even if you want to show
your mum the dance,

934
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:08,162
there will be a lot
of audiences as well.

935
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:14,002
Actually, I've got an idea.

936
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:15,203
I think we can combine

937
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:15,923
the cheerleading dance

938
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,323
with the dance I do.

939
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:18,642
Are you willing to hear me out?

940
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:19,522
Of course.

941
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,283
I'm your go-to director.

942
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:22,803
Let's talk about it after school.

943
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:23,562
Sure.

944
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:36,883
(What are you doing?)

945
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,883
(What else can I do?)

946
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:40,883
(I've slept)

947
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,042
(for 12 hours today.)

948
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:43,403
(I'm bored.)

949
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,042
(You can study.)

950
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:49,522
(You won't feel bored while studying.)

951
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,602
Why don't you come and tutor me?

952
00:38:55,323 --> 00:38:56,723
Kang Jiawei, why are you so childish?

953
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:01,883
Gao Zhan,

954
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:02,883
why are you here?

955
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:04,562
I'm here to visit you.

956
00:39:07,683 --> 00:39:08,363
This is for you.

957
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:11,522
Thank you.

958
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:12,642
These are the resource materials

959
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:13,363
I bought for you.

960
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,203
I've also brought you the notes

961
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:15,843
and the homeworks

962
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:17,002
for Chinese, Math and English.

963
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:20,522
Are you feeling better now?

964
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:21,482
Do you still have a fever?

965
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:34,642
You're a bit feverish.

966
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,042
I feel much better.

967
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:40,522
Before you're discharged,

968
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:41,763
I'll come here everyday

969
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:42,803
to get you back up to speed.

970
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:43,723
Really?

971
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:44,883
For real.

972
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,042
(What will I gain if I come?)

973
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:05,803
Do you understand my notes?

974
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:08,162
Is it shorthanded?

975
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:09,203
No, no.

976
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:10,283
I think it's very detailed.

977
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:11,562
At least it's more detailed than what

978
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:12,482
Kang Jiawei gave me.

979
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:13,283
You didn't know this.

980
00:40:13,482 --> 00:40:14,283
The one that he gave me

981
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:15,082
was a Double Dutch.

982
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:16,482
Really?

983
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:20,482
Today, Ms. Chen also talked

984
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:21,482
about the Culture and Art Festival.

985
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:24,323
The Culture and Art Festival?

986
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:27,962
How could I forget about it?

987
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:29,962
What's wrong?

988
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:32,283
Back then,

989
00:40:32,482 --> 00:40:34,323
there were too few members
in Taekwondo Club.

990
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,243
So we didn't

991
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:36,243
get to perform.

992
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:38,082
Thanks to you, we've got

993
00:40:38,283 --> 00:40:39,363
enough members this year.

994
00:40:40,082 --> 00:40:41,203
But I fell ill

995
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:42,642
at a time like this.

996
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,283
I'm so incompetent.

997
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:50,203
Do you have any idea

998
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:51,203
for this performance?

999
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:54,642
Why don't

1000
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,723
you choreograph it with me now?

1001
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:58,283
I'll teach them when I go back.

1002
00:40:58,482 --> 00:40:59,162
Wait until you're discharged,

1003
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:00,363
we'll go on stage together.

1004
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:05,042
Can I do that?

1005
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:06,363
You can.

1006
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:09,482
Okay.

1007
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:13,042
Okay.

1008
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:14,122
Pause for a second.

1009
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:16,082
Take a look.

1010
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:18,683
Actually, you make the same mistakes

1011
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:19,843
during video shooting.

1012
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:20,642
When you reach

1013
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:21,522
the chorus part,

1014
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:23,042
your dance moves are
actually not sychronised.

1015
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:23,723
Besides,

1016
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:24,763
Wei Xue should switch position

1017
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:25,723
with Zhang Lili.

1018
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,522
Let's go it again, fight on.

1019
00:42:28,803 --> 00:42:29,482
Kang Jiawei,

1020
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,403
thanks for helping me.

1021
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:32,843
Are you free after school?

1022
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,482
I'd like to buy you a meal.

1023
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:37,723
And I can ask for your advice

1024
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,923
about the adjustment of the formation.

1025
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,442
Sure.

1026
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:45,723
Then, let's go to the coffee shop.

1027
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:46,522
Sure.

1028
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:50,442
Where is Gao Zhan?

1029
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:52,962
Stop hiding. Come on out.

1030
00:42:54,803 --> 00:42:56,403
Gao Zhan hasn't come yet.

1031
00:42:57,962 --> 00:42:58,683
Quick.

1032
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:00,002
Let me show you this.

1033
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:01,283
This is

1034
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:02,203
the notes

1035
00:43:02,403 --> 00:43:03,522
that Gao Zhan wrote for me.

1036
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:05,002
Gao Zhan actually

1037
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,642
came to help you with homeworks.

1038
00:43:07,403 --> 00:43:08,162
What does it mean?

1039
00:43:08,843 --> 00:43:09,962
What can it mean?

1040
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,203
He came here to tell me

1041
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:13,162
about the class

1042
00:43:13,363 --> 00:43:13,883
and

1043
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:14,843
the Taekwondo performance.

1044
00:43:15,363 --> 00:43:16,243
That's all.

1045
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:18,723
At least he came.

1046
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:21,442
Gao Zhan is a super male chauvinist.

1047
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,042
It's already a miracle

1048
00:43:24,082 --> 00:43:25,723
as he can do this much for you, okay?

1049
00:43:25,962 --> 00:43:26,723
That's right.

1050
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,082
At least, he's better

1051
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:28,803
than someone

1052
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:29,562
who's heartless.

1053
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:31,763
You mean Master Kang?

1054
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,082
He doesn't even call me.

1055
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,162
Kang Jiawei has been busy lately.

1056
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:38,562
What is he up to?

1057
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,323
It seems like he's helping Xu Jingjing

1058
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:42,843
with the preparation
of the cheerleading performance.

1059
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:43,923
She's joining

1060
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,082
the Culture and Art Festival too.

1061
00:43:46,883 --> 00:43:47,923
What has it got to do

1062
00:43:48,122 --> 00:43:48,602
with him?

1063
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:49,522
He doesn't dance.

1064
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:50,562
How would I know that?

1065
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:51,642
If you're curious,

1066
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:52,803
go ask him yourself.

1067
00:43:53,122 --> 00:43:54,002
That's right.

1068
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:02,122
I'd like to put the solo in the middle.

1069
00:44:02,323 --> 00:44:03,082
As for the formation,

1070
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:04,723
(Classics Coffee Style Coffee)
I think we can switch it

1071
00:44:04,923 --> 00:44:05,962
to this formation.

1072
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:07,602
What do you think, Kang Jiawei?

1073
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:10,122
The coffee shop doesn't
only sell coffee.

1074
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:11,082
Perhaps it got his favourite

1075
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:12,602
Red Bean Matcha Milk Tea

1076
00:44:13,002 --> 00:44:13,843
or Fruit Tea.

1077
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:14,923
Maybe he's developed

1078
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:15,883
a taste for coffee.

1079
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:17,522
Thank you, I don't drink coffee.

1080
00:44:17,763 --> 00:44:18,482
I have caffeine intolerance.

1081
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:19,482
You drink it.

1082
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:22,683
Kang Jiawei?

1083
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:26,642
What did you say?

1084
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:28,403
I said I want to switch the formation

1085
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:29,522
into this.

1086
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:30,803
What do you think?

1087
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:37,803
What's wrong?

1088
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:39,203
Are you okay?

1089
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:47,482
This shop only sells coffee.

1090
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:52,803
Gao Zhan doesn't drink coffee.

1091
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:53,803
Do you know that?
