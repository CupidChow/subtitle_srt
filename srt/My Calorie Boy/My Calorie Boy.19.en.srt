=Episode 19=
(My Summer Holiday, My Say)

16
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,170
You've studied Taekwondo

17
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,170
for so many years.

18
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,450
You're guaranteed to excel
if you choose a sports major.

19
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,890
Why do you have to choose arts?

20
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,090
After you graduate,

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,610
I'll fund you

22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,700
to open up a Taekwondo academy.

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,970
Or if you think that's too much work,

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,810
then we can start

25
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,170
a wedding planning company
and make money together.

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,220
Doesn't that sound nice?

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,450
I don't want to start
a wedding planning company!

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,940
I want to study interior design!

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,220
How are you any different

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,970
from Xu Jingjing's mother

31
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,020
if you plan my life out for me?

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,220
What do you mean...

33
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,250
I...

34
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,860
Jingjing!

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,980
Look at your daughter!

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,450
She slammed the door on me!

37
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,770
My daughter has changed.

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,820
Yes.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,770
She dares to talk back to us now.

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,980
No.

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,420
She has become

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,930
more assertive

43
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,140
and knows what she wants now.

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,140
Look at how much she has changed

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,140
in the past year.

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,020
Her grades went up

47
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,260
so much.

48
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,450
And look what she did

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,490
today.

50
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,100
(Revision Schedule)
She must've put a lot of work

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,210
(Revision Schedule)
and effort into this.

52
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,210
She did all of this

53
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,100
just

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,020
to convince us.

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,890
Xu, I'm serious.

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,820
I think

57
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,770
we can't let our daughter

58
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,890
down.

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,580
Just let her try.

60
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,730
If she does fail,

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,770
she'll give up.

62
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,490
If she actually fails,

63
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,730
it'll be even harder for her!

64
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,490
Why are you so sure

65
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,730
that she would fail?

66
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,300
I'm not underestimating our daughter.

67
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,100
But do you know

68
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,380
how many people who take
the unified examination

69
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,700
for art students actually end up
getting admitted?

70
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,020
It's even more competitive
than the college entrance examination.

71
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,490
There aren't enough opportunities

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,580
to go around, Jiaren.

73
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,100
Jingjing

74
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,700
has always been competitive
and prideful.

75
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,860
If she gives her all

76
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,330
into this

77
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,100
and fails,

78
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,100
she might never get up again.

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,050
How will she

80
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,020
get up and take
the college entrance exam then?

81
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,100
It'll be too late.

82
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,490
I'm sorry,

83
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,860
little piggy.

84
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,170

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,380

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,530
Instructor, please...
I can't take it anymore...

92
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,380
Hang in there.

93
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,090
Instructor Fan.

94
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,890
Jingjing, you're here.

95
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,290
I haven't seen you in a while.

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,700
Well, I had some free time on my hands,

97
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,820
so I thought I would drop by.

98
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,450
All right. Take a break.

99
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,090
I'm sorry

100
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,650
I haven't stopped by in a while.

101
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,650
I know you're busy.

102
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,090
You'll be taking

103
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
the college entrance examination
next year, right?

104
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,290
But I've been practising every day.

105
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,890
I saw on your Wechat Moments

106
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,580
that you're hiring instructors.

107
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,330
Yes.

108
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,770
But you just missed it.

109
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,500
A boy came by earlier.

110
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,210
He fit the criteria,

111
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,410
so I gave him the job.

112
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,940
I'll be leaving now, Instructor Fan.

113
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,060
Xu Jingjing?

114
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,290
Gao Zhan?

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,770
You guys know each other?

116
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,740
We're classmates.

117
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,290
Well,

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,820
your class is certainly filled
with talents.

119
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,410
Well,

120
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,140
since you filled the position,

121
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,090
I'll take my leave then, Instructor Fan.

122
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,410
Since you're here,

123
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,210
do you want to join us

124
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,650
for practice?

125
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,450
No, that's all right.

126
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,770
I just remembered
that I had something to do.

127
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,330
I'll be leaving now.

128
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,700
All right. Gather around.

129
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,580
Hurry up.

130
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,450
Xu Jingjing!

131
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,820
Are you looking for a part-time job

132
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,620
during the summer break too?

133
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,380
I discussed it with Instructor Fan.

134
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,820
I don't have much experience.

135
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,450
We can teach the classes together.

136
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,890
We'll split the money.

137
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,020
I... I don't think that's appropriate...

138
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,500
You don't have to be courteous.

139
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,450
Thanks a lot, then, Gao Zhan.

140
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
You really helped me out.

141
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,890
But why do you need a part-time job?

142
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,380
Well,

143
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,580
I want to apply for a design course.

144
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,180
But to do that,

145
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,410
I'll have to pass
the unified exam for art students first.

146
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,700
So I'm planning on enrolling

147
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,090
in an art class during the summer.

148
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,620
Didn't your parents agree?

149
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,890
What about you?

150
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,650
Why do you need a job?

151
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,290
I'm in a similar situation.

152
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,820
I want to save up money

153
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,260
to do myopia surgery.

154
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,530
But why would you need

155
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,740
to pay for that yourself?

156
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,850
If I tell you the truth,

157
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,260
would you keep it a secret?

158
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,330
I wanted to go to Beijing

159
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,210
to apply
to the Public Security University.

160
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,330
You want to be a police officer

161
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,450
like your dad.

162
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,140
But my mom

163
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,330
would never say yes.

164
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,180
My dad died in the line of duty.

165
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,850
She would freak out.

166
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,260
So

167
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,650
you want to earn money
for the surgery yourself.

168
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,180
Just like how you want to earn money

169
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,210
for your tuition fee.

170
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,620
Oh, right.

171
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,500
If you split the money with me,

172
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,140
will you have enough

173
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,330
for the surgery?

174
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,060
Instructor Fan said

175
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,180
that if we do well,

176
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,940
he might open

177
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,850
another children's class

178
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,650
in the summer.

179
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,330
That'll make up
for the rest of the money.

180
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,210
Gao Zhan,

181
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,210
thank you.

182
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,210
I look forward to working with you.

183
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,940
Miss Zhou,

184
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,580
I have something

185
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,970
to discuss with you.

186
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,410
Go ahead.

187
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,620
It's about the tuition fee...

188
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,580
I'm afraid we can't go any lower.

189
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,650
All the other kids

190
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,620
pay the same amount.

191
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,620
No.

192
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,060
I meant to ask

193
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,060
if I could be billed by the day.

194
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,650
Billed by the day?

195
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,620
Do you have a problem?

196
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,290
Um...

197
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,770
My family...

198
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,500
Miss Zhou,

199
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,820
Jingjing's family
isn't exactly well-off.

200
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,850
Right.

201
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,770
My family isn't well-off.

202
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,620
So could you please

203
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,850
make an exception?

204
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,820
But we've always required students

205
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,450
to settle the fees in one lump sum.

206
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,580
Miss Zhou, help Jingjing out.

207
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,210
She really likes art.

208
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,940
How about this?

209
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
I'll put your name down.

210
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,530
For the first five days,
you can pay by the day.

211
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,090
You can use the five days

212
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,940
to see if art is for you.

213
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,410
If you decide to continue,

214
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,890
you'll have to settle the rest
of the fees in one go.

215
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,500
Okay!

216
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,380
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

217
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,020
You're going to teach Taekwondo?

218
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,530
My friend and I talked about this.

219
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,020
We'll teach the classes together.

220
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,050
I'll start this weekend.

221
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,140
I don't mean anything else by that.

222
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
I just want to let you guys know

223
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,260
that I can

224
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,620
pay the fees myself.

225
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,980
Don't mind him, Jingjing.

226
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,290
Eat.

227
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,890
The money you earn
from teaching Taekwondo

228
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,930
won't be enough to cover
the tuition fees, right?

229
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,890
It's fine, Mom.

230
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,860
Don't worry.

231
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,100
I can handle this myself.

232
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,650
I just want to show him

233
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,650
my resolve.

234
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,530
Let's eat.

235
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,620
You've gained weight
because of your injury.

236
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,220
You need to control your diet.

237
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,410
Oh, right.

238
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,050
I found you

239
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,650
a teacher
from the advanced class, Miss Zhao.

240
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,380
They say

241
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,140
that a lot of her students

242
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,810
made it into dance academies.

243
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,890
You'll train under her

244
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,930
for the summer.

245
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,690
She just recovered.

246
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,140
Can't you give her
a bit more time to rest?

247
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,740
We don't have time to lose.

248
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
It's because of her injury

249
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,810
that she is still in place

250
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,570
when others have already gotten ahead.

251
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,690
If you ask me,

252
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,020
you should drop

253
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,530
that thesis writing class too.

254
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,380
It would be better for you
to use that time

255
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,770
to practise your dance moves.

256
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,100
What if

257
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,290
I failed the college entrance exam
for art students?

258
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
So be it.

259
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,860
It's fine.

260
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,290
You can try again next year.

261
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,530
What are you saying?

262
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,530
Is that any way to teach your child?

263
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,220
And you.

264
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,930
Already thinking about failing
before even taking the exam.

265
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,530
How are you supposed to do well
with an attitude like that?

266
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,410
Mom,

267
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,980
do I have to get into the dance academy?

268
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,740
Xu Jingjing,

269
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,740
do you know how much energy and money

270
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,170
I have invested

271
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,050
in raising you

272
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,620
to dance ballet

273
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,620
since you were a child?

274
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,170
Do you know how much effort it took

275
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,140
to get Miss Zhao to accept you?

276
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,050
Normally, she only accepts students

277
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,860
from schools affiliated
with dance academies.

278
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,340
She would've never been

279
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,020
spared a glance

280
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,340
at someone like you
from an ordinary high school.

281
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,380
Hearing you say that

282
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,100
really makes me disappointed.

283
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,930
All right. I understand, Mom.

284
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,650
I will go.

285

(Registration Form)

289
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,570
You've thought it through?

290
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,770
No.

291
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,340
But I can't bear to see her like that.

292
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,020
Just let her go.

293
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,690
At worst, she'll just retake
the exam the next year.

294
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,690
Hey, don't change the channel! I...

295
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,100
I forked out the money.

296
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,770
Can't I even watch

297
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,930
something I want?

298
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,770
Of course. Watch whatever you want.

299
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,770
Never mind.

300
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,620
Well, when it comes to something
you're passionate about,

301
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,570
you have to try,

302
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,890
even if it ends in failure.

303
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,980
I think

304
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,100
that's what Jingjing thinks.

305
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,500
No, you...

306
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,140
All right. Fine.

307
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,140
Don't tell her

308
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,260
this money is from me.

309
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,290
My stance

310
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,380
will never change.

(Kang Jiawei)

312
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,290
Hello?

313
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,260
What?

314
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,290
Aren't you starting

315
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,220
that art class today?

316
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,650
Well, you're starting

317
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,050
that essay writing class
of yours, too, right?

318
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,570
It's called
the Technology Thesis Writing Class.

319
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,980
It's all the same.

320
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,260
Guess who I ran into

321
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,020
at my part-time job?

322
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,980
Who?

323
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,770
Gao Zhan.

324
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,650
We'll be working together

325
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,020
to teach little kids Taekwondo.

326
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,340
Hold up.

327
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,620
You're going to be working together

328
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,740
with Gao Zhan this summer?

329
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,740
But

330
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,740
I think it's not so awkward

331
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,100
being with him anymore.

332
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,100
Not a chance!

333
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,460
You must remember at all times

334
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,020
that he read

335
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,170
that creepy notebook of yours.

336
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,460
Well, he confessed to me

337
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,690
on the rooftop too.

338
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,530
Strictly speaking,
that's not a confession.

339
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,650
He just told you he wanted

340
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,770
to go to university in Beijing

341
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,620
with you.

342
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,570
Nothing else.

343
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,260
I think that's a great idea.

344
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,690
Beijing isn't for you.

345
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,460
There are too many people,
and the traffic is bad.

346
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,620
The pace of life is too fast there.

347
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,980
Is that so?

348
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,020
Jingjing,

349
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,290
breakfast!

350
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,530
Coming!

351
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,860
I'll talk to you later.

352
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm going to have breakfast. Bye.

353
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,500
What a feast.

354
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,930
Your dad made breakfast.

355
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,290
I don't have an appetite.

356
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,860
Don't let your stomach go hungry.

357
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,100
Here.

358
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,860
What is the meaning of this?

359
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,340
For your tuition fees.

360
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,530
You're starting
the class today, aren't you?

361
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,140
What?

362
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,740
Did you change your mind?

363
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,810
Is this money from my dad too?

364
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,260
No.

365
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,890
I'm giving this to you behind his back.

366
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,380
I knew I was your biological daughter.

367
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,170
Oh, you.

368
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,650
All right. Eat your breakfast.

369
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,500
Don't worry.

370
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,650
I'll pay you guys back

371
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,100
once I have the money.

372
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,740
Oh, you don't need to do that.

373
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,650
You just have to study hard

374
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,410
and not change your mind

375
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,860
and give up halfway.

376
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,100
I won't.

377
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,860
I will work hard this time.

378
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,260
I will take responsibility

379
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,100
for my decision.

380
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,410
But these are two different matters.

381
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:06,980
I will definitely

382
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,740
pay you back

383
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,740
when I get paid.

384
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,570
You worked hard to earn this money.

385
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,340
My Jingjing is all grown up.

386
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,890
I scoped the area.

387
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,020
Three convenience stores
at the entrance,

388
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,860
two fast food places,

389
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,810
one Malatang shop,

390
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,290
and one pizza place.

391
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,810
That's quite a detailed observation.

392
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,570
Of course.

393
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,260
How about this?

394
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,770
If

395
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,810
I finish class earlier,

396
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,530
I'll buy the food

397
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,380
and go to find you.

398
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,050
How about that?

399
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:34,690
You can wait for me

400
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,020
in the garden at the back too.

401
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:36,770
The view is nice.

402
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,290
A garden?

403
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,170
Wonderful! There's even a garden!

404
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,980
Do you think this place is a resort?

405
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,140
Who is this?

406
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,930
Hello, Mr. Qin.

407
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,020
Hello.

408
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,770
You lucked out.

409
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,690
I can't believe you got Snape
as your teacher.

410
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I didn't expect him
to teach the beginner's class.

411
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,220
Good luck, Jingjing.

412
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,380
Is he that scary?

413
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,930
Zhang Chang'an.

414
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,100
No way!

415
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,170
100 times worse.

416
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,410
Class is starting.

417
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,410
I'm off.

418
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,020
Hey, you at the door.

419
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,890
Feet glued to the floor?

420
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,170
Are you coming inside?

421
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,290
If you're not, I'm closing the door.

422
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,480
(Coach)

423
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,290
What are you looking at?

424
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,100
Nothing.

425
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,020
Can I ask you for a favour?

426
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,460
I signed up

427
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,890
for dance lessons
at a hip-hop studio this summer.

428
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,890
I might need to leave early sometimes.

429
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,890
Could you cover for me

430
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,050
with the teacher?

431
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,620
Does your mom know about this?

432
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,050
Of course not.

433
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,100
So

434
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
I'm counting on you, Mr. Kang.

435
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,860
Got it.

436
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,170
You

437
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,340
haven't been on Douban much lately.

438
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,530
You didn't reply

439
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,770
to the message I sent you.

440
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,740
I've been busy.

441
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,050
I don't really manage the group anyway.

442
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,570
I gave the administrator role
to someone else.

443
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,740
The ﻿Chiaroscuro is bad.

444
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,940
Continue.

445
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,610
Sir... Sir...

446
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,530
I can't draw

447
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,900
with your watching.

448
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,810
Everyone, stop.

449
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,290
Let's take a look
at this masterpiece together.

450
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,090
No...

451
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,090
No need for that...

452
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,940
Not only is the perspective a mess,

453
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,460
but you didn't even manage
to illustrate

454
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,500
the light and dark contrasting tones.

455
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,050
What is your name?

456
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,180
Xu Jingjing.

457
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,610
You're taking
the unified exam this year?

458
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,570
That means
you only have six months left.

459
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,660
And this is the level of work
you're producing.

460
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,700
No, sir, I'm new here.

461
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,850
I've never learned this before.

462
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,180
Is that an excuse?

463
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,050
Is that an excuse?

464
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,660
Are you going

465
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,370
to tell the examiner

466
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,770
to go easy on you

467
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,090
because

468
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,290
you've never learned this before?

469
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,020
I know a lot of you

470
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,180
have never learned this subject before.

471
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,900
So you guys already have a slower start

472
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,810
than others.

473
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,130
Have you ever thought about

474
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,850
how you guys

475
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,180
are possibly going to compete

476
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:56,900
against students

477
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,050
who studied arts for years,
maybe decades,

478
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,980
on the same track six months from now?

479
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,530
This is not the Children's Palace

480
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,330
or a hobby class.

481
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,610
You must be prepared

482
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,460
when you come to my classroom.

483
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,460
No excuses.

484
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,940
No breaks.

485
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,530
No slacking off.

486
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,420
The pencil

487
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,660
is meant to create beauty,

488
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,770
not trash.

489
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,050
Start over!

490
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,600
(ArtDragon Martial Arte Taekwondo)

491
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,680
(Taekwondo)

492
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,850
You're here.

493
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,770
What's the matter?

494
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,570
Why aren't you getting changed?

495
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,090
I need a moment.

496
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,420
It's an hour to get here

497
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,460
from the intensive class.

498
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,020
How was your class today?

499
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,260
Oh, don't bring it up.

500
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,770
We had a super strict teacher

501
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,130
named Snape.

502
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,290
I think

503
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,130
he has ASPD.

504
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,740
He finds pleasure in torturing others.

505
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,460
It can't be that bad.

506
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,180
Why not?

507
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,420
He actually tore up my drawing!

508
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,660
Why?

509
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,260
Was it because

510
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,330
your drawing wasn't good?

511
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,220
He... He even told us

512
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
that there would be no breaks

513
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,260
in the intensive class.

514
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,180
During class, you draw.

515
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,770
After class, we held a meeting

516
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,610
to reflect

517
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,260
on what was wrong with our drawings.

518
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,850
I missed something,
and I got a scolding.

519
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,460
Well, I'm new.
How was I supposed to know?

520
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,700
That's just abnormal!

521
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,130
You haven't answered my question.

522
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:54,810
Was it because

523
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,940
your drawing was bad?

524
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,610
Fine. Yes! Happy?

525
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,530
Well, I think

526
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,850
he is a responsible teacher.

527
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,050
It's not a bad thing

528
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,290
for you, at least.

529
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,330
Well,

530
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,610
couldn't he have had a better attitude?

531
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,980
Why be so sarcastic?

532
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,220
It's just a matter
of his teaching methods.

533
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,260
Ugh, I can't talk to you about this anymore.

534
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,180
Straight men. I'm going to get changed.

535
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,090
Did I say something wrong again?

536
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,220
The food here is nice.

537
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,900
Right?

538
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,570
It's just a little too expensive.

539
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,180
Why did you choose

540
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:48,940
such an expensive place?

541
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,370
Oh, that's not a concern.

542
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,330
Don't worry about it.

543
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,220
Think of this
as an early celebration for Qixi.

544
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,460
Why are you sweating so much?

545
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,530
Are you not feeling well?

546
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,260
I... I'm just a little nervous.

547
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,660
Hui,

548
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,090
we've known each other

549
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,850
for almost two years now.

550
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,660
Meeting you

551
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,370
is my greatest...

552
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,570
It's the luckiest thing
to have happened to me.

553
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,980
Loving you

554
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:24,770
is...

555
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,130
is...

556
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:26,810
That's enough, Ni.

557
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,290
Stop.

558
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,610
I'm sorry, I...

559
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,460
I did

560
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,530
memorise the script.

561
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,660
But I was so nervous
I forgot everything.

562
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,700
Hui,

563
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,740
we've known each other
for almost two years now.

564
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,370
-Ni.
-You are my...

565
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,810
Let's hold this off for a while.

566
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,900
Hold... Hold this off?

567
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,570
What... What do you mean?

568
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,660
What I mean is...

569
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,500
Let's take a break.

570
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,570
Take... Take a break?

571
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,770
Why?

572
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,220
It's Gao Zhan, isn't it?

573
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,570
It's me.

574
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,810
It's me.

575
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,740
Hui,

576
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,020
did... did I do something wrong?

577
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,810
Can you tell me what I did wrong?

578
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,900
You didn't do anything wrong, Ni.

579
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,090
You're a good man.

580
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,370
The problem

581
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,660
is with me.

582
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,180
I'm sorry, Ni.

583
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,090
Hui...

584
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,940
Gao Zhan.

585
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,500
You...

586
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,740
You actually proposed to my mom?

587
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,260
I did,

588
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,020
and I was rejected.

589
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,050
Gao Zhan,

590
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,180
did you say something
to your mom again...

591
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:17,900
I swear

592
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,610
I didn't have anything to do with this.

593
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,570
Then why...

594
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,050
Why would she turn me down?

595
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,660
She hasn't mentioned you lately.

596
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,020
She doesn't even talk about me anymore?

597
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,900
So I don't even know
what's going on between you two...

598
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,460
Why?

599
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,810
Why would she want

600
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,530
to break up with me all of a sudden?

601
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,330
You...

602
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,660
You didn't do anything wrong

603
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,660
to my mother, did you?

604
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,570
My mother

605
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,500
has a very sensitive sense of smell.

606
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,900
Nothing! I swear!

607
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,810
You know

608
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,050
my character, don't you?

609
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,020
Not really.

610
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,370
Gao Zhan,

611
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,700
we formed an alliance

612
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,290
that day, didn't we?

613
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,850
Well, I wouldn't call it an alliance.

614
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,740
All right, all right. Fine.

615
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
I came to you

616
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,770
to see

617
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,700
if you could go back

618
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,330
and help me ask your mom

619
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,700
why did she say those things today.

620
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,290
All right.

621
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,900
I know that's too much to ask of you.

622
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,660
You get busy then.

623
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,460
I'll take my leave now.

624
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,940
Oh, why...

625
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,050
Oh, that Gao Zhan!

626
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,020
How could he side

627
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,130
with Snape?

628
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,050
I just don't understand him.

629
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,240
(Xu Jingjing)

630
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,770
Why are you calling me?

631
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,900
I was bored on my way home.

632
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,530
Isn't Gao Zhan with you?

633
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
I was just about to tell you about him.

634
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,180
Listen.

635
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,050
He was "amazing" today!

636
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,500
Do you know why?

637
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,180
It's Xu Jingjing.

638
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,180
What do I want for dinner?

639
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,020
You decide.

640
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,290
I'm happy to have anything with you.

641
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,180
Hello? Sorry.

642
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,020
That was Xu Jingjing.

643
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,500
She asked me
what we were getting for dinner.

644
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,460
Carry on.

645
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,460
What about Gao Zhan?

646
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,370
What did he do?

647
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,290
Oh, nothing.

648
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,900
I just wanted to tell you

649
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,090
that he looked so cool

650
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,980
in the Taekwondo uniform today.

651
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,290
Go and get dinner with Xu Jingjing.

652
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,500
Gao Zhan and I
are going out for dinner together too.

653
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,460
Okay. See you.

654
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,330
-They're moving so fast?
-They're moving so fast?

655
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,040
(I didn't expect you
to be such a foodie.)

656
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,800
(Who can view this? Xu Jingjing only.)

657
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,160
(Publish)

658
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,540
(Kang Jiawei. I didn't expect you
to be such a foodie.)

659
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,500
You can have this.

660
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,020
(You eat quite a lot.)

661
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,770
Waiter!

662
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,290
Three more servings of steamed buns!

663
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,720
(Xu Jingjing. I didn't know you like
Beef and Onion Buns too.)

664
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,610
(So you like)

665
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,700
(beef and scallion buns too.)

666
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,610
(Happy!)

667
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,040
(Imported snacks. Souvenirs. Fruits.)

668
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,020
(An evening filled
with the fragrance of peaches.)

669
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,290
I'll carry it.

670
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
Little girl,

671
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,610
why are you

672
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,900
following us?

673
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,240
(While taking a walk after dinner,
we ran into a granny...)

674
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:10,940
(While taking a walk after dinner,)

675
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,530
(we)

676
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,460
(ran into a granny
who insisted that we buy her flowers.)

677
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,770
(Which KTV has the best sound system?)

678
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,260
(I haven't gone clubbing for long.)

679
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,810
What the heck...

680
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,660
What am I doing?

681
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,570
Not going to bed yet, Mom?

682
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,260
No. I'll go to sleep in a bit.

683
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,850
Why aren't you in bed yet?

684
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,570
I came out to get some water.

685
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,420
Is something wrong?

686
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,420
Mom,

687
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,460
what's going on between you and Mr. Ni?

688
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,370
Nothing.

689
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,570
Kids shouldn't interfere

690
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,740
with adult matters.

691
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,050
Didn't you say

692
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,500
you were happy with him?

693
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,220
So why are you breaking up with him now?

694
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,220
Aren't you happy

695
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,420
to hear that we're breaking up?

696
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:27,900
Mom,

697
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,660
you can't pin that on me.

698
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,700
I have no objections whatsoever

699
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,050
to your relationship with him now.

700
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,050
I actually think

701
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,770
that Mr. Ni

702
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,530
is a pretty decent guy.

703
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,740
You really want to know?

704
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,500
You'll be heading into Grade 12 soon.

705
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,130
It's the most crucial year for you.

706
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,330
I was too selfish before this.

707
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,420
So I don't want to do anything

708
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,260
that might

709
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,850
affect your taking
your college entrance exam now.

710
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,130
Why would your being with Mr. Ni

711
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,370
affect me?

712
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,850
If I accept Mr. Ni

713
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,980
and we decide to come together

714
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,370
and reconstitute a family,

715
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,420
will you be okay with that?

716
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,850
Yes.

717
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,810
I've tolerated Dapeng for two years.

718
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,700
Reconstituting a family

719
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,570
isn't as easy or simple as you think.

720
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,050
We'll need to work
on all aspects of our lives.

721
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,940
What if we live together

722
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:33,940
in the same space

723
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,660
and find out
that we aren't compatible?

724
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,660
We can't waste all our time

725
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,290
on solving

726
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,660
family conflicts.

727
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,460
Mom,

728
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,570
let's leave that out for now.

729
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,130
Set aside everything

730
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,330
and just tell me

731
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
if you still have feelings for Mr. Ni.

732
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,420
All right.

733
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,500
It's late.

734
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,220
Get some rest.

735
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,500
You need to get up early tomorrow.

736
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,130
But...

737
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,130
No buts.

738
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,290
I know what you mean.

739
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,980
I'll give it more thought.

740
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,770
Next,

741
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,850
let's take a look at the eighth step.

742
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,530
For the eighth step,

743
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,810
we will have

744
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,530
to examine,

745
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,460
standardise, and edit the paper

746
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,530
in a technical manner.

747
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,290
Next,

748
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,420
choose the topic of your thesis.

749
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,050
There are two points to consider
when choosing your topic.

750
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,500
The size

751
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,330
and the value of the topic.

752
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,810
How do we gauge the size of a topic?

753
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,290
First, we look at the scope.

754
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,770
(Kang Jiawei. Which KTV has a better sound system?)
When choosing a topic

755
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,980
(While taking a walk after dinner, we ran into a granny...)
for your thesis,

756
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,660
you need to consider

757
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,460
the breadth of the content
and the scope of the topic.

758
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,370
(Only 3 days of Moments are viewable.)
You must consider your own writing abilities

759
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,020
(Only 3 days of Moments are viewable.)
when choosing your topic.

760
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,460
If the scope is too wide,

761
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,370
it'll be difficult for you
to grasp the focus.

762
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,610
Pay attention.

763
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,050
Don't be scrolling on your phone.

764
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,740
Good morning.

765
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,330
You're here.

766
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,260
I left without saying goodbye

767
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,090
after class yesterday.

768
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,050
Sorry.

769
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,370
It's fine.

770
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,020
Dapeng's dad came to see me.

771
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,810
He told me that my mom
wanted to break up with him.

772
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,050
Break up?

773
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,090
Why?

774
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,810
Did you talk to your mom about it?

775
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:57,810
I did.

776
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,850
From what she said, it sounds like
her main concern is not wanting

777
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,330
their relationship to affect my
taking the college entrance exam.

778
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,500
That's all?

779
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,220
I couldn't understand her either.

780
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,900
It feels like I wouldn't be doing

781
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,050
right by her sacrifice if I don't try

782
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,740
to make it into Tsinghua University
or Beijing University.

783
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,370
What are you going to do then?

784
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,570
I've said what I should.

785
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,180
But that's not fair

786
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,660
to Mr. Ni.

787
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,260
If I do get accepted
into Public Security University,

788
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,570
I'll be studying in Beijing
for four years.

789
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,740
In fact,

790
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,370
I would like it if there was someone

791
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,180
to take care of her

792
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,290
while I'm away.

793
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:40,940
Is that

794
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,220
too selfish of me?

795
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,130
Not at all.

796
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,130
You're her son.

797
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,660
It's normal for you to think that way.

798
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,810
Really?

799
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,090
I think

800
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,130
you should support

801
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:50,810
Mr. Ni

802
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,220
right now

803
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,370
and convince your mom
to get back together with him.

804
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,770
Will you help me?

805
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,250
Mr. Ni,

806
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,730
I've told you

807
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,460
the general situation in the message.

808
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,250
Yes.

809
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,090
But

810
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,940
I think your mom

811
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,020
made a fair point.

812
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,610
I mean,

813
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,090
you're different from Pengpeng.

814
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,780
You're aiming

815
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,820
for Tsinghua University
and Beijing University.

816
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,570
No, you...

817
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,570
You guys can say whatever you want,

818
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,690
but why drag me into this?

819
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,610
No, you...

820
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,420
Mr. Ni.

821
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,020
Gao Zhan is talking to you.

822
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,500
Go on.

823
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,500
I still think

824
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,380
you should have a proper talk

825
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,380
about this with my mom.

826
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,090
You shouldn't break up
over something like this.

827
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,530
I would not let my studies

828
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,130
be affected

829
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,130
by your relationship.

830
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,130
Gao Zhan,

831
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,940
is that what you truly think?

832
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,380
I'm responsible for my own studies.

833
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,860
It has nothing to do

834
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,420
with whether you're together.

835
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,340
Then...

836
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,210
The proposal...

837
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,130
I think what matters the most

838
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,210
is your sincerity.

839
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,250
First,

840
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,690
you need

841
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,050
to propose to my mom properly.

842
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,730
Like what they do in dramas.

843
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,020
Make a heart

844
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,570
with candles below my house

845
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,500
and fill the middle with roses.

846
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,780
Do you play the guitar?

847
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,730
If you do,

848
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
you can sing while you play...

849
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,130
Wait. Stop.

850
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,730
I can't listen to any more of this.

851
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,900
What cliche is that?

852
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,170
That's way too corny.

853
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,860
Is it?

854
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,860
Is it not?

855
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,940
I thought it was romantic.

856
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,900
A guy like you
who knows nothing

857
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,340
about what girls want
deserves to be single for life.

858
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,380
Well, Xu Jingjing,

859
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,130
tells us what sort of proposals

860
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,300
girls would like then.

861
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,530
First of all,

862
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,900
we need to analyse the target.

863
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,090
What does Madam Shi work as?

864
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,460
She's the Editor-in-Chief of a magazine.

865
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,380
She is cultured.

866
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,650
So she would want something

867
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,610
sophisticated and simple.

868
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,380
She would hate

869
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,300
something that's too garish.

870
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,020
Well,

871
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,460
if I don't do anything special,

872
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,300
would that make me look cheap?

873
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,610
No. But I think Gao Zhan

874
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,020
is right about one thing.

875
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,460
You must be sincere.

876
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,420
Jingjing, you can make fun of me.

877
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,300
I

878
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,250
am just short

879
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,730
of digging my heart out
and giving it to her.

880
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,340
Madam Shi

881
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,210
is concerned

882
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,250
that if you get together,

883
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,210
it'll affect

884
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,500
Gao Zhan and Dapeng's studies.

885
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,250
Yes.

886
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,020
So we'll prove to her
that it won't happen

887
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,170
and dispel her doubts!

888
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,210
No...

889
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,650
How... How are you going to prove that?

890
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,610
Be more specific.

891
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,210
Right. Elaborate.

892
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,900
I have an idea.

893
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,610
Um,

894
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,690
Snape didn't make things

895
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,090
difficult for you today, did he?

896
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,090
He didn't try anything today.

897
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,860
That's good.

898
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,860
Um...

899
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,170
How's your room design coming along?

900
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,020
Let me show you my work.

901
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,980
What do you think?

902
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,500
It's okay.

903
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,690
Um...

904
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,780
It looks great!

905
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,420
Forget it.

906
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,650
That's a bit too forced.

907
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,980
But considering your taste,

908
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,210
I guess I shouldn't expect much
from you.

909
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,300
You're right.

910
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,980
I'm not really good with aesthetics.

911
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,690
What do you think of Xu Jingjing, then?

912
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,610
She is okay.

913
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,690
Just okay?

914
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,900
She is the belle of the school!

915
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,900
You're definitely

916
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:13,940
shortsighted.

917
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,530
You better get that surgery done soon.

918
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,210
But I think you look nice.

919
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,690
You don't just look nice.

920
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,250
You're funny and kind too.

921
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:20,980
Stop.

922
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,050
Sorry, I'm not good with words.

923
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,900
No, no, no.

924
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,820
That's not what I meant.

925
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,420
Jingjing,

926
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,900
how about

927
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,460
we apply

928
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,420
for universities in Beijing together?

929
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,650
I did my research.

930
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,650
Beijing has a lot

931
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,860
of good art academies too.

932
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,130
(Thank you for your help today.)

933
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,020
(Don't mention it.)

934
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:51,780
(Xu,)

935
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,980
(we'll be counting on you
for the proposal.)

936
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,980
(What?)

937
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:54,940
(A proposal?)

938
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:55,690
(You're going...)

939
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,730
(Gao Zhan. Thank you so much.)
(to be brothers with Gao Zhan for real.)

940
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,820
(Congratulations!)

941
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,530
What?

942
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:00,940
Why is Gao Zhan

943
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,530
getting Xu Jingjing involved
in his family's affairs?

944
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:05,980
No.

945
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,570
I can't wait any longer.

946
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,090
Jingjing,

947
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,300
I have to tell you something

948
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,940
that has been

949
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,730
in my heart for a while now.

950
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,940
Xu,

951
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,940
let me tell you something.

952
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,900
Will she beat me up

953
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,380
after she hears what I have to say?

954
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,690
Hey, girl,

955
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,420
do you know

956
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,170
who that online friend

957
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,250
I've been talking to actually is?

958
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,900
It's you.

959
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,520
(Gao Zhan)

960
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,420
Kang Jiawei,

961
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,690
answer me honestly.

962
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,210
Do you think

963
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,650
I'm not normal?

964
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,780
You seem normal to me.

965
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,860
But I don't think I am.

966
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,690
I never know

967
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,300
what to say or do

968
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,530
when I'm around girls.

969
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,500
Are you talking about Xu Jingjing?

970
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,130
Yesterday, I told her

971
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:23,610
that there are

972
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,780
a lot of good art academies
in Beijing, too,

973
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,020
and she seemed unhappy.

974
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,300
And... After that?

975
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,090
She left.

976
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,210
So this is the emergency

977
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,610
you mentioned over the phone?

978
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,690
Do you know

979
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,300
that I have

980
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,940
something way more important to do?

981
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,130
Sorry.

982
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,340
Am I

983
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,420
taking up your time?

984
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,420
Why don't you go ahead

985
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,980
and do what you need to do?

986
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,780
Forget it.

987
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,380
Since I'm here,

988
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,170
I might as well give you
a few words of advice.

989
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,250
You wanted me

990
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,250
to go over what happened
with you, right?

991
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,530
Yesterday, at the cafe,

992
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,340
Xu Jingjing told you

993
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,020
she was cold, right?

994
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,130
Yes.

995
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,170
What was your reply?

996
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,380
I asked if her feet were cold.

997
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,610
She said yes.

998
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,050
So I said

999
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,420
that it was caused by the sinking

1000
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,300
of the cold air.

1001
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,530
My goodness! My goodness!

1002
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,650
Couldn't you have asked the waiter

1003
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,250
to increase the temperature
of the air conditioner?

1004
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,250
You're right.

1005
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,570
Why didn't I think of that?

1006
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,250
Gao,

1007
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,860
I understand you. I get you.

1008
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,170
But I don't!

1009
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,570
I don't think

1010
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
I know anything about girls at all.

1011
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,090
Every time I talk to them,

1012
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,900
I eventually say something wrong.

1013
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,380
But I think

1014
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,610
you know girls quite well.

1015
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,500
I mean,

1016
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,940
what would you have said

1017
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,780
about

1018
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:47,780
the art teacher?

1019
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:48,730
In any case,

1020
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,780
I wouldn't say anything nice about him.

1021
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,650
If I did,

1022
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,980
that would mean
going against Xu Jingjing.

1023
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,340
But I think...

1024
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,420
What you think doesn't matter.

1025
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,610
It's what she thinks that matters.

1026
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,020
What are friends for?

1027
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,500
Friends are people
you fawn over people you like with,

1028
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,900
talk bad about others together,

1029
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,050
and an alliance
where you be unreasonable together.

1030
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,020
A united front. Do you understand?

1031
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,300
If it were me,

1032
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,380
I would've complained
about that guy with her.

1033
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,650
I would be even harsher.

1034
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
What Snape?

1035
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,130
More like Voldemort.

1036
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,460
Thanos! Megatron!

1037
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,780
Is that all right?

1038
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,780
Of course not.

1039
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,570
But you need

1040
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,940
to let her
get it out of her system first.

1041
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,690
Once she returns to her senses,

1042
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,690
then you can slowly

1043
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,690
tell her

1044
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,500
what you really think.

1045
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,380
If

1046
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,020
she is willing to listen,
then she listens.

1047
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,780
But you need

1048
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,820
to be observant.

1049
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,610
If at any point there are signs

1050
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,780
that you're losing her,

1051
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,420
you turn around
and continue to roast the guy.

1052
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,530
Got it?

1053
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,570
I think I still need
to digest all of that...

1054
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,900
I have to talk bad about him too...

1055
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,610
If she doesn't get it,

1056
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,900
I continue...

1057
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,300
Then...

1058
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,900
Gao,

1059
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,420
you called out to her

1060
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,860
on the rooftop, didn't you?

1061
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,690
What's her take on it?

1062
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,020
She hasn't said

1063
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,300
if she would apply

1064
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,300
to study in Beijing with me.

1065
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,780
But I can wait.

1066
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,980
Gao,

1067
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,500
sometimes,

1068
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,860
you can't force these things.

1069
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,380
Maybe all she wants to do

1070
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,170
right now

1071
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,690
is to concentrate
on preparing for the exam.

1072
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,210
But she's all

1073
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,130
I can think about right now.

1074
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,340
I feel restless

1075
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,500
if I go a day without seeing her.

1076
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,130
Besides, I don't want to be a guy

1077
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,300
who doesn't know
anything about girls anymore.

1078
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,730
I want to be like you.

1079
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,050
Master Kang,

1080
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,650
teach me more of your ways.

1081
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,250
Well, sometimes,
when you learn too many things,

1082
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,380
things can get messy and confusing.

1083
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,730
I'm not worried about that.

1084
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,340
What's the matter?

1085
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,610
Your mood swings

1086
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,860
have been a bit much lately.

1087
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:18,940
Dad,

1088
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,500
am... am I a coward?

1089
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,900
What's this about?

1090
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,380
It's nothing.

1091
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,300
Oh, don't stop there.

1092
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,210
Tell me.

1093
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,610
Well,

1094
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,780
today,

1095
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,530
someone wanted me to be their teacher

1096
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,420
and help them solve a question.

1097
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:45,940
And?

1098
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,170
I didn't want to help them,

1099
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,780
but I felt like

1100
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,130
the question was tailor-made for me.

1101
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,170
Only I knew

1102
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,380
the answer to the question.

1103
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,250
So

1104
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,130
I had a chance

1105
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,820
to solve it today.

1106
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,170
But

1107
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,090
I... I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1108
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,690
What's holding you back?

1109
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,130
I... I'm just afraid

1110
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,500
that the answer I have

1111
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,860
isn't the same

1112
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,730
as the one that's given

1113
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,210
on the answer sheet.

1114
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,380
I'm afraid
of misinterpreting the question.

1115
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,650
Well, maybe review the question again?

1116
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,340
Give it some more thought.

1117
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,780
Sometimes,

1118
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,820
it takes time to get an answer.

1119
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,420
Dad, you don't understand.

1120
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,340
I have

1121
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,340
never come across

1122
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,610
such a difficult problem before.

1123
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,900
That's because all those problems

1124
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,500
have never mattered to you.

1125
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:47,690
Have you

1126
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,090
heard of this saying?

1127
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:50,900
"Love

1128
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,500
is a touch

1129
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,210
and yet not a touch."

1130
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,130
Dad,

1131
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,820
I'm talking about a question.

1132
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,170
That's what I'm talking about too.

1133
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,420
What does this

1134
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,940
have anything to do with love?

1135
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,250
I thought it was an essay question.

1136
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,730
Where has your mind gone off to?

1137
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,300
Eat.

1138
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,980
Essay?

1139
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,780
I...

1140
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,650
No.

1141
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,050
I was talking about a math problem.

1142
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:40,730
Tangtang,

1143
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,340
tell Zhou Tian

1144
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,570
to rewrite the first three chapters

1145
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,380
and put more thought into them.

1146
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,300
Yes, Editor-in-Chief.

1147
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,170
Qi,

1148
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,050
remind the other authors

1149
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:47,980
to submit their manuscripts.

1150
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:48,730
Got it.

1151
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:53,980
Hello? Who is this?

1152
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,420
Hello? Madam Shi?

1153
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,420
Gao Zhan and Dapeng
