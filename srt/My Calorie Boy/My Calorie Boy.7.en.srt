(I'm a girl, I want to run.)

16
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:45,698
What do you think?

17
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:47,338
This is my family's factory.

18
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:48,498
Three levels altogether.

19
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,379
It produces more than 1,000 a day.

20
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,819
That's impressive, Mr. Ni.

21
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,218
Great business acumen.

22
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:54,819
I don't deserve that.

23
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:56,298
Mr. Ni is my dad

24
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,338
while I'm Mr. Ni Junior.

25
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,418
I thought my brother is coming.

26
00:01:59,578 --> 00:01:59,979
Where is he?

27
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:00,858
Your brother?

28
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:01,698
Gao Zhan.

29
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:03,698
He's still stuck in traffic.

30
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:04,698
By the way,

31
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:05,979
I'm being serious here.

32
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,379
Would your dad agree with this?

33
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:09,339
Master Kang,

34
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,138
are you serious

35
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,339
about letting me become the host?

36
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,259
You better don't go back on your words.

37
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,298
Can I,

38
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,099
or have I ever broken my promise?

39
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:20,099
I already told the teacher about this.

40
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:21,298
You can ask Xu Jingjing about it.

41
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:22,539
Okay.

42
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:23,898
Since you said that,

43
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,138
you can leave this matter to me.

44
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,259
I promise I'll take care

45
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,059
of this for you.

46
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:29,339
No way.

47
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,418
Absolutely not.

48
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:31,738
You've seen the factory's situation.

49
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,219
We're busy rushing

50
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,059
to complete our orders every day.

51
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:35,339
You can't expect me to stop

52
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:36,939
and custom-make your clothes.

53
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:37,458
Dad,

54
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:40,618
I'm the host

55
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,738
of the school sports event.

56
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:43,779
Can't you give me

57
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:44,779
some face?

58
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,898
Host?

59
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,339
You better don't do it.

60
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:48,659
Lest you'll humiliate me.

61
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,298
Dad,

62
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:50,979
am I your son,

63
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,219
or did you adopt me?

64
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,819
You have such a huge garment factory.

65
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:54,819
Can't you do it at all?

66
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:55,379
Son.

67
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:55,738
You...

68
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:56,979
I have to stop you there.

69
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,099
I've helped you out a lot.

70
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,339
You can be the judge.

71
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:01,339
In elementary school,

72
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,298
he wanted to be a flag-bearer.

73
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,219
Did I or did I not make the uniform

74
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:06,298
for the whole school?

75
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,339
Did you become
the flag-bearer after that?

76
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:08,939
I didn't end up...

77
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,738
Yeah, you didn't end up as one.

78
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,138
What about junior high school?

79
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:14,018
You said your school had no computers.

80
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:15,178
So I built a computer room

81
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,138
and sponsored more than ten computers

82
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:17,939
with high specifications.

83
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:18,939
But what did you do?

84
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,499
You invited all your classmates

85
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,418
to play Counter-Strike.

86
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:22,219
Did I spend

87
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,499
so much money to make myself unhappy?

88
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:25,339
In the last semester,

89
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,659
did I or did I not buy

90
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,499
all the equipment

91
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:29,018
for your school basketball team?

92
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:29,939
Also,

93
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:30,898
that...

94
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:31,779
That's all.

95
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:34,178
Well,

96
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:35,659
Dad.

97
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:36,939
You see.

98
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,618
You have such a huge business.

99
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,418
Just take them as doing charity.

100
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:41,659
A good man will lead a peaceful life.

101
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:43,219
Son, listen to me.

102
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,099
Just buy it online.

103
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,259
I'll pay for them.

104
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,259
That'll settle it.

105
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:47,659
Mr. Ni,

106
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,138
money isn't the issue.

107
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,979
It's because these are customized.

108
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:53,138
The sports event is on Monday.

109
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,418
It's already too late to order.

110
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,738
Right, it's already too late.

111
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,059
Son, you see.

112
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,018
Those workers...

113
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:01,339
Sorry.

114
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,138
I was stuck in traffic.

115
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:02,738
That's why I'm late.

116
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:03,458
Gao Zhan?

117
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,298
They didn't tell me you're coming.

118
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,698
Come and have a seat.

119
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:08,379
Gosh.

120
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:09,458
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

121
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:10,578
Gao is puzzled because of your dad.

122
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:11,339
You're unbelievable.

123
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:14,138
Mr. Ni,

124
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:15,539
do you know me?

125
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:18,818
Of course, I do.

126
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:20,459
How can I not know you?

127
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,418
Everyone knows you rank first
in your grade.

128
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,298
The school commends you every day.

129
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:25,298
Unlike him

130
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,418
who's always criticized by the school.

131
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,099
Why don't you tell him?

132
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:30,659
Go ahead.

133
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:31,099
What is it?

134
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:31,659
Mr. Ni,

135
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:32,899
here's the thing.

136
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,858
We're really out of ideas.

137
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:36,219
We wanted to buy

138
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:37,258
ready-made uniforms online.

139
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,099
But if we make the order now,

140
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,019
they won't arrive on time.

141
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,099
So we could only ask

142
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:43,938
for your help in this matter.

143
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:44,699
I know

144
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,178
it'll put you in a difficult position.

145
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:46,938
Oh, not at all.

146
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:47,738
I'll tell

147
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,418
them

148
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:49,339
to stop their current work

149
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,498
and work overtime
to produce your uniforms.

150
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:52,298
Don't worry about it.

151
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:53,979
See?

152
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:54,979
Do you see how generous my dad is?

153
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:56,539
Son,

154
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,019
don't flatter me.

155
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:58,539
You

156
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,498
should practice your lines

157
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:00,099
as the host.

158
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,579
Don't mess it up

159
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:01,899
and say it's...

160
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:02,298
I'll definitely practice it.

161
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,219
Mr. Ni, please take a look.

162
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:03,938
This is the draft design.

163
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:04,498
Is it okay?

164
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,258
Okay.

165
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,738
Not a problem.

166
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:07,699
I'll tell the guys now.

167
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:11,418
Pour water for Gao Zhan.

168
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,810
(Yuming Senior High School)

169
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,579
Dear teachers and students,

170
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:22,858
(Zhang Zhiqiang)
good morning.

171
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:23,818
Good morning!

172
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:33,298
With the wind and sunny day...

173
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:36,699
That's funny.

174
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,298
It's a breezy and sunny day,

175
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,899
not with the wind and sunny day.

176
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,058
On this breezy and sunny day,

177
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:44,818
it's the annual sports event

178
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:46,459
of Yuming Senior High School.

179
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:48,459
The colorful flowers are

180
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,738
the life of vibrant youth.

181
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:52,618
The smiling face filled
with high spirits comes

182
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,699
from self-confidence
and unswerving determination.

183
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:57,498
It's a display of vigor and vitality

184
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,139
when youth and passion come together.

185
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,099
Next,

186
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,058
let's invite Principal Shen

187
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:04,178
to say a few words.

188
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,219
Good!

189
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:13,498
Hello, Gao.

190
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,019
Listen. Calm down first.

191
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:17,899
My car broke down
in the middle of the road.

192
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,738
I've been trying to hail a taxi

193
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,258
but there's none around.

194
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:22,539
I understand, Mr. Ni.

195
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,699
Why are you still out here?

196
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,858
We're waiting
for our opening ceremony uniforms.

197
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:28,979
But the car broke down

198
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:29,579
on its way here.

199
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,058
We're running out of time.

200
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:32,019
We should get it ourselves.

201
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:33,659
I should go, then.

202
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:34,618
You have to stay here.

203
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:35,579
You're the homeroom teacher.

204
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:37,378
If you're not here
during the opening ceremony,

205
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,139
Mr. Zhang will cause trouble again.

206
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:41,019
What should we do now?

207
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,178
Miss Chen,

208
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,738
do you need help?

209
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:50,099
No one can challenge Class 2!

210
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,979
We'll make a clean sweep
and dominate the event!

211
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:54,498
Principal Shen.

212
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:55,699
Next comes

213
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:56,539
Class 3,

214
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:57,618
which I told you about before.

215
00:06:58,498 --> 00:06:59,979
These students are unruly.

216
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:01,779
The homeroom teacher is young too.

217
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:03,579
She's clueless and opinionated too.

218
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:04,258
Where's Class 3?

219
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:05,618
What's going on?

220
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:06,498
Where did Class 3 go?

221
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:06,979
Where are they?

222
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,139
It's Class 4 after this.

223
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,219
Where are our classmates?

224
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:10,899
I'm thinking the same thing too.

225
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:12,058
What's going on?

226
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,099
What happened?

227
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:13,539
I wonder too.

228
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:14,738
Where are they?

229
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,219
Xu Jingjing,

230
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:18,779
well...

231
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:21,498
See there?

232
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,219
Don't you think

233
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:24,699
the sky is

234
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:27,019
blue today?

235
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,378
It's so blue.

236
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:30,178
You're right.

237
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,498
The vast blue sky allows

238
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,858
the young athletes
of Yuming Senior High School to soar.

239
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,378
Victory is waving at everyone.

240
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,818
You can do it, Yuming athletes!

241
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,579
In such a setting,

242
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:44,418
I suddenly want to recite a poem

243
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,178
to express my personal feelings.

244
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,779
Yuming athletes are mighty!

245
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:55,579
How mighty.

246
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,099
Young people are fearless.

247
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,099
Only Class 6 are powerless.

248
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,659
What did you say?

249
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,818
He said we're powerless.

250
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:06,979
Then, you're next.

251
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,498
All they do is cause problems.

252
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,019
Well done!

253
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,178
Great poem!

254
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:15,219
Hey!

255
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:16,699
(Grade 11 Class 6)
What did you say?

256
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,618
Dapeng, get down here!

257
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:19,579
Let's talk about it!

258
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,378
Get him here!

259
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:22,779
What nonsense is this?

260
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:23,899
Turn your mic off now.

261
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,019
Mr. Zhang.

262
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:25,858
Dapeng,

263
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:26,818
I knew you were unreliable

264
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:27,339
as the host.

265
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:29,339
Even Xu Jingjing follows
your bad examples now.

266
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,178
I think she's doing okay.

267
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:31,418
Where are your classmates?

268
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,179
Why aren't they here yet?

269
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:32,898
Mr. Zhang,

270
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:34,258
my classmates aren't ready yet.

271
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:34,979
Can we let

272
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:35,819
the next class march first?

273
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:37,858
Your class is too undisciplined!

274
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,018
Where's Miss Chen?

275
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:40,299
Does she teach you nothing?

276
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,258
Next, let's invite Class 4
to enter the field.

277
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:46,819
Xu Jingjing,

278
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,299
who told you to skip Class 3?

279
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:49,219
Mr. Zhang,

280
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:50,378
you said

281
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:51,299
we can't spend too much time

282
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,179
on the opening ceremony.

283
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,339
If we keep waiting for my class,

284
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,498
we'll be wasting time.

285
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:55,099
That's right.

286
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:56,258
Shut up!

287
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:01,778
Principal Shen,

288
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:02,579
you've seen it.

289
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:03,858
This is the class Miss Chen is teaching.

290
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:04,699
What nonsense!

291
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:05,258
Mr. Zhang.

292
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:05,979
It's outrageous.

293
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:07,219
You don't have to throw a fit.

294
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:07,858
Sit down

295
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:08,939
and watch the opening ceremony.

296
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:16,339
Why is he still not here?

297
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:23,459
There he is.

298
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:38,339
We can still make it.

299
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,099
You guys go ahead.

300
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:42,018
Thanks.

301
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:42,778
Did we make it?

302
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:45,699
You look cool.

303
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:47,419
I'll get going now.

304
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,219
(Grade 11 Class 7)
We dare to be the forerunner.

305
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,618
That's why we're Class 7.

306
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,219
We dare to be the forerunner.

307
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,898
That's why we're Class 7.

308
00:09:59,138 --> 00:09:59,699
What's going on?

309
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:00,858
Why is our class not ready yet?

310
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:01,819
I don't know.

311
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:02,699
Xu Jingjing!

312
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:03,979
If your class is not here,

313
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:04,579
I'll disqualify

314
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:05,778
Class 3 from the sports event.

315
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:06,618
That's right.

316
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:07,419
Why are they not here yet?

317
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:07,939
Where are they?

318
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:08,658
Are they coming or not?

319
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:09,299
There they are!

320
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:09,819
Where on earth did they go?

321
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:10,699
They're coming.

322
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,419
Where?

323
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:12,059
Over there?

324
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:12,858
Where?

325
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:14,699
Gosh.

326
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:16,459
Are you ready?

327
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,819
We are ready!

328
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,898
March!

329
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,640
(Grade 11 Class 3)

330
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:11,378
Outrageous!

331
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:12,898
I want you

332
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:13,498
to take off your skirts!

333
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:15,258
I'm a girl!

334
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:17,018
I want to run!

335
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,819
I'm a girl!

336
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:20,419
I want to run!

337
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,138
Principal Shen,
look how ridiculous they are!

338
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,498
I think Class 3's opening ceremony

339
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:25,339
looks pretty interesting.

340
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:26,979
I want to run!

341
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,579
I'm a girl!

342
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,419
I want to run!

343
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:31,979
I'm a girl!

344
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,658
I want to run!

345
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:35,378
I'm a girl!

346
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,018
I want to run!

347
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,138
I'm a girl!

00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:40,939
I want to run!

349
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,819
I'm a girl!

350
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:44,459
I want to run!

351
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,778
I'm a girl!

352
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,898
I want to run!

353
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:50,778
I'm a girl!

354
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,699
I want to run!

355
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,299
I'm a girl!

356
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:55,898
I want to run!

357
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:57,138
I'm a girl!

358
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,138
I want to run!

359
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,099
I'm a girl!

360
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,898
I want to run!

361
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:04,538
I'm a girl!

362
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,258
(Grade 11 Class 3)
I want to run!

363
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,299
I'm a girl!

364
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:10,258
I want to run!

365
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,138
I'm a girl!

366
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:13,898
I want to run!

367
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,459
I'm a girl!

368
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,018
I want to run!

369
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,579
I'm a girl!

370
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:20,099
I want to run!

371
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:44,738
Get changed now!

372
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,459
Forget that Class 3 has
the worst results.

373
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,018
Yet, you kept taking the lead
to cause trouble.

374
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,258
They didn't cause any trouble.

375
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,498
They're just expressing themselves.

376
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,339
What's there to express?

377
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,099
What kind of influence

378
00:12:59,299 --> 00:12:59,858
are they showing

379
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:00,699
to the other students here?

380
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:02,378
What kind of influence?

381
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,819
Why don't you be specific?

382
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,618
I'm going to handle
this matter seriously.

383
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:08,498
Seriously, I say!

384
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,099
I'll take the responsibility, then.

385
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:10,459
You're right!

386
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,179
All of you will be held accountable!

387
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:14,538
All of you, including your teacher!

388
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:16,699
Mr. Zhang.

389
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:18,219
Principal Shen.

390
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,339
I don't think

391
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,299
there's a problem

392
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:22,819
for girls to take part in the marathon.

393
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:26,579
Principal Shen,

394
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,018
you knew

395
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:29,538
Yuming Senior High School never had the tradition

396
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:30,939
of girls running in marathons.

397
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:31,898
Principal Shen,

398
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,658
our school motto says

399
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:34,858
freedom, equality,

400
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:35,819
wisdom, and innovation.

401
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:36,778
I think not letting girls participate

402
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,579
in the marathon doesn't agree

403
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:38,939
with the motto of freedom and equality.

404
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:41,819
Mr. Zhang is

405
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:42,979
also a wise man.

406
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,498
So, we'll make a new change

407
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:45,179
starting this semester.

408
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:46,618
We didn't make the changes before.

409
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:48,018
Therefore, it's the school's fault.

410
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:49,179
If there's a problem,

411
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:50,378
we should solve it, right?

412
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:51,858
From this semester on,

413
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,538
we'll add a women's group
for the marathon.

414
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,339
Five minutes after the boys run,

415
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:57,258
the girls will start running.

416
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:58,898
We'll split the timing.

417
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,979
Does that mean
I can join the marathon now?

418
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:01,618
Of course.

419
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:02,699
All the female students in this school

420
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:03,699
can join the marathon.

421
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:04,339
Am I right,

422
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:05,498
Mr. Zhang?

423
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:07,378
Yes.

424
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,930
(Waves Of Excitement.
Let Your Dreams Soar)

425
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:24,538
When you pass the baton,

426
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:25,258
don't be too nervous.

427
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,059
The one in front

428
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,419
must hold the baton before speeding up.

429
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:28,699
Dapeng.

430
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:29,819
When you receive the baton,

431
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:30,939
watch your position

432
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,378
and don't go beyond the exchange zone.

433
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:33,579
Don't worry about that.

434
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:34,658
Kang Jiawei,

435
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:35,498
you're at the curve of the track.

436
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:36,658
What determines victory and defeat

437
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:37,979
isn't how fast you run,

438
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,138
but how well

439
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:39,738
you balance your body.

440
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,339
You must not slip.

441
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,219
Ni Dapeng!

442
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:49,858
What?

443
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,658
That's mine!

444
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,299
Is it yours?

445
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:54,579
Come on, don't be stingy.

446
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,099
I'll buy you a box after this, okay?

447
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:58,658
May the athletes
for the 4x100 relay race

448
00:14:58,858 --> 00:14:59,898
take your positions on the track field.

449
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:00,898
All right.

450
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:02,498
Let's do this.

451
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:04,658
Three. Two. One.

452
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:05,378
We can do it!

453
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,858
(Li Lixia  Shen Wentao)
You can do it!

454
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,579
You can do it!

455
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:10,378
On your marks!

456
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:13,258
Get set!

457
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:20,898
You can do it!

458
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:22,819
Kang Jiawei, you can do it!

459
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,618
Kang Jiawei, you can do it!

460
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,658
You can do it!

461
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,618
Kang Jiawei, you can do it!

462
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:52,419
Kang Jiawei!

463
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,059
How are you feeling?

464
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:06,219
Do you feel better now?

465
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:07,898
The teacher said
you had low blood sugar.

466
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:08,979
Eat this.

467
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:11,179
I'm fine.

468
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:13,059
Did our class win

469
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:13,699
the relay race?

470
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:14,299
Yes.

471
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:15,498
After Gao Zhan took the baton,

472
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:16,459
he sped up and won the race for us.

473
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:18,979
But

474
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,738
why did you have low blood sugar

475
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:21,819
when it's only a-100-meter race?

476
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,819
I was

477
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,459
in a rush this morning.

478
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:27,419
So I didn't have my breakfast.

479
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,498
You also passed out
because of low blood sugar

480
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,099
in the basketball match that day.

481
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:32,378
Why don't I bring you for a checkup

482
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:32,898
at the hospital?

483
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,858
Low blood sugar is normal.

484
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,219
But you passed out

485
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:37,538
too frequently.

486
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:38,939
I'm fine.

487
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:40,459
It's not that serious.

488
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:41,459
How is it not serious?

489
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:42,498
If it's severe,

490
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:43,538
it's fatal.

491
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:47,339
Did you take

492
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:48,258
a picture of me from the seats?

493
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:48,778
No.

494
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:50,138
I'm sure you did.

495
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:50,498
No, I didn't.

496
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,258
I saw you take pictures of me!

497
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:51,819
Show it to me!

498
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:53,898
Now.

499
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:03,858
Kang Jiawei.

500
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:05,139
I think

501
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,578
you look good in women's apparel.

502
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:07,018
How about this?

503
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,459
I'll upload it to the school's forum.

504
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,179
Xu Jingjing,

505
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:10,778
I did it for you.

506
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:11,899
How can you have no conscience?

507
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,538
Fine.

508
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:18,859
To be honest,

509
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,619
I was moved today.

510
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:24,778
That's more like it.

511
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:28,338
Sorry.

512
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,298
I was the reason you're not the host,

513
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:32,498
and

514
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,578
you didn't take pictures
with Xu Jingjing.

515
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:38,859
Speaking of this,

516
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:42,738
I think Xu Jingjing is a little...

517
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:45,098
What?

518
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:47,899
Nothing.

519
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:48,859

00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:31,098
Xu Jingjing!

693
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:32,778
You can do it! Run faster!

694
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:35,058
(Beyond The Limits)
I don't want to call him dad!

695
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:35,859
Li Huiya,

696
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:37,939
I want him to call me dad!

697
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:39,459
What did you just say, Niu Junfeng?

698
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:40,699
Sir, you misheard me.

699
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:41,699
I said

700
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,498
Li Huiya, you can win this!

701
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:44,659
Xu Jingjing,

702
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:45,619
you can do this!

703
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:46,379
Li Huiya,

704
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,258
you can do it!

705
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:48,058
Li Huiya,

706
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:48,899
you can do this!

707
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:50,899
You can win this!

708
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,018
You can do it!

709
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:53,738
Xu Jingjing!

710
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:57,338
Xu Jingjing!

711
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:03,899
You can win this!

712
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:04,738
Xu Jingjing,

713
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:05,818
you can do this!

714
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:06,538
Xu Jingjing,

715
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:07,538
you can win this!

716
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:08,338
Xu Jingjing,

717
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:09,459
you can do this!

718
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:10,379
Xu Jingjing,

719
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:11,338
you can do this!

720
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:12,098
Xu Jingjing,

721
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:28,578
you can do this!

722
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:29,738
You can do it!

723
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:30,379
Xu Jingjing,

724
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,258
you can do it!

725
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:51,419
You can do it!

726
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,738
Wow!

727
00:25:58,298 --> 00:25:58,738
Awesome!

728
00:25:58,939 --> 00:25:59,298
Are you okay?

729
00:25:59,498 --> 00:25:59,859
Are you all right?

730
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:00,459
Send her to the infirmary now.

731
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:01,538
I'll take her.

732
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:12,578
Wait.

733
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:15,298
Where are we going?

734
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,258
Stop talking.

735
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,338
Save your energy.

736
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:27,058
Okay, you're all good now.

737
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:28,818
You can go back now.

738
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:30,379
Only one person can stay to watch her.

739
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:31,538
Thank you, Miss.

740
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:32,419
Gao,

741
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:34,219
why don't you stay

742
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:35,298
and accompany Xu Jingjing?

743
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:36,859
You should stay.

744
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:37,778
I need to go

745
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:38,578
to Miss Chen's office.

746
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:42,459
You should go, then.

747
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,139
Thanks, guys.

748
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:46,699
We should thank you.

749
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:47,778
Rest well.

750
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:48,859
Okay.

751
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:50,979
We'll get going, then.

752
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:52,939
Take good care of her.

753
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:06,179
It looks like

754
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:07,899
we took turns being admitted
to the infirmary.

755
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:09,659
I'm not you.

756
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,338
I'm not weak like you.

757
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:12,738
It's okay

758
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:14,018
if you didn't finish the race
and be the champion.

759
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:15,498
I told you

760
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:16,338
I can call him dad.

761
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:18,619
I never knew

762
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:19,979
you were this considerate.

763
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:24,699
Here.

764
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,018
Let me show you something.

765
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:36,979
Only one?

766
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,258
Don't be so demanding.

767
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:40,619
Wait a minute.

768
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,419
You're so bad at taking pictures.

769
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:47,139
My legs look so thick.

770
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:47,859
Or did you edit it?

771
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,859
It doesn't make me look like an idol

772
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:50,538
at all.

773
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:53,258
If you keep complaining,

774
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:53,979
I'll delete it.

775
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,139
No, don't delete it. I'm sorry.

776
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:56,659
Does the picture look good?

777
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:57,498
Yes.

778
00:27:58,419 --> 00:27:58,899
Do your legs look thick?

779
00:27:59,379 --> 00:27:59,738
Not at all.

780
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:00,859
I'll delete it since you said
they're not thick.

781
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:01,538
Yes, they are thick.

782
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:05,578
Remember to send it to me.

783
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:08,298
I'll send it

784
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:09,859
only if you become

785
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:10,699
the domesticated elf for several days.

786
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:13,219
Kang Jiawei,

787
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:14,699
have you forgotten

788
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,778
I have a picture of you in a skirt?

789
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:18,018
You didn't delete it?

790
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:18,979
I'll upload it

791
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:19,699
to the forum later.

792
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:21,219
Fine.

793
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,738
I'll delete your picture right now.

794
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:24,379
No, don't!

795
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,538
Don't delete it

796
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:26,139
or I'll upload it!

797
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:26,859
What about mine?

798
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:27,379
You...

799
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:28,258
You have to delete my picture too.

800
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:28,778
No way!

801
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:29,338
Give it to me!

802
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:30,659
I'll delete it after you send it to me.

803
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:31,219
What are you doing?

804
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:32,058
Are you bullying a patient?

805
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:33,098
Where's your phone?

806
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,498
I have no phone.

807
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,139
Patient? I'm also a patient!

808
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:40,659
The school's online forum

809
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:41,538
is full of Gao Zhan

810
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:43,179
and Xu Jingjing's pictures.

811
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:47,139
What's wrong with that?

812
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,258
Didn't you notice
Gao Zhan and Xu Jingjing

813
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:51,778
are pretty close during this semester?

814
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,338
No.

815
00:28:57,058 --> 00:28:57,619
Jingjing,

816
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,578
you're obviously closer to Gao Zhan.

817
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:04,738
I can't change

818
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:05,738
the way he thinks.

819
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:14,699
The Men's Group 4x100 race,

820
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:15,619
gold medal.

821
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,098
The Women's Group 4x100 race,

822
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:19,098
gold medal.

823
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:21,258
The Men's Group triple jump,

824
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:22,139
gold medal.

825
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:23,498
Next,

826
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,859
let's welcome

827
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:26,939
the first

828
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,058
mini-marathon Women's Group's champion,

829
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,619
Xu Jingjing!

830
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,859
Wow!

831
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:39,459
Awesome!

832
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,778
Which class said Class 3

833
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:43,979
is a good-for-nothing class again?

834
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:45,699
By the way, Kang.

835
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:46,778
I remember

836
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,139
someone made a bet

837
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,018
with our class.

838
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:50,459
Cut to the chase. Admit that you lost.

839
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:51,899
You should keep your word as a man.

840
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:52,818
That's right.

841
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:54,298
Sure, I'll keep my word.

842
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:55,899
What was it again?

843
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:56,659
What did I promise?

844
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:57,058
You said you'll crawl.

845
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:58,139
Yeah, crawl.

846
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:01,018
We'll crawl!

847
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:03,419
Crawl now.

848
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:12,098
Forget it.

849
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:13,098
You don't have to crawl.

850
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:15,379
Wait, what?

851
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:16,379
He must do it.

852
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:16,818
Crawl.

853
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:17,498
Hurry.

854
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:19,258
Gao Zhan said we don't have to crawl.

855
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:19,738
That's right.

856
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:20,419
You...

857
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,498
We should save their dignity.

858
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,818
But you still need to cheer the slogan.

859
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:24,298
He's right.

860
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:25,538
Cheer the slogan!

861
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:26,098
Yes!

862
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:26,818
Do the cheer slogan.

863
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:27,338
Do it.

864
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:28,899
Okay.

865
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:31,619
Long live Class 3.

866
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:33,859
Long live Class 3.

867
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:34,498
That's too weak.

868
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:35,338
What is this?

869
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:36,459
Just let them crawl, then!

870
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:38,298
No! No! No!

871
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,298
Long live Class 3!

872
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,619
Long live Class 3!

873
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:41,899
Long live Class 3!

874
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:42,778
Long live Class 3!

875
00:30:42,818 --> 00:30:43,179
Smile!

876
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:43,979
Smile!

877
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:45,179
Long live Class 3!

878
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,498
Long live Class 3!

879
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:47,899
Long live Class 3!

880
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:49,498
Look at Niu Junfeng.

881
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:50,939
Niu Junfeng,

882
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,179
you reap what you sow.

883
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:53,659
Long live Class 3!

884
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:54,939
Long live Class 3!

885
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,179
Long live Class 3!

886
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:57,139
Long live Class 3!

887
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:57,738
Louder.

888
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:58,459
Long live Class 3!

889
00:30:58,659 --> 00:30:59,459
Long live Class 3!

890
00:30:59,538 --> 00:30:59,818
Enough!

891
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:00,939
Long live Class 3!

892
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:02,578
Don't go too far.

893
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:04,939
Miss Chen,

894
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:06,058
they're doing it willingly.

895
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:07,018
That's not good either.

896
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:08,659
You should go.

897
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:11,459
See how fast they run.

898
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:15,979
Did I ruin it for you guys?

899
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:22,818
Let's go and have something to eat.

900
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:23,939
My treat.

901
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:28,859
Let me say a few words.

902
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:32,018
First of all,

903
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:34,139
I want to congratulate Class 3

904
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:34,859
for winning four gold medals

905
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:36,538
in the sports event.

906
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:37,859
Awesome!

907
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,179
The most important thing is

908
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:42,899
Xu Jingjing

909
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:43,619
brought together both genders

910
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,018
to unite and break

911
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,018
the ridiculous rules

912
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:49,498
through her unrelenting efforts.

913
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:51,139
A toast to all the students

914
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:51,939
of Class 3.

915
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:52,899
Cheers!

916
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:56,379
Cheers!

917
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:00,538
Let's continue eating.

918
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:01,379
Dig in.

919
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,219
Sorry,

920
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:03,778
I'm late.

921
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:04,899
Mr. Zhao.

922
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:06,058
Mr. Zhao,

923
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:09,139
are you two...

924
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:13,459
You guys better cut it out.

925
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:15,018
Mr. Zhao has been a great help

926
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:16,018
to our class.

927
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:17,498
You must thank Mr. Zhao for that.

928
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:18,659
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

929
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:19,939
I didn't do much anyway.

930
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,219
You're the capable ones.

931
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:22,098
Mr. Zhao.

932
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:25,459
If it weren't for your divine help,

933
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:26,139
I think our plan

934
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,098
would have been ruined.

935
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:29,139
Miss Chen,

936
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:30,338
thank you.

937
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:31,619
I thought

938
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:32,899
you'll scold us

939
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:34,058
for wearing skirts

940
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:34,659
as a group.

941
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:36,538
Miss Chen,

942
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,498
I think you've changed.

943
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:39,659
Yes.

944
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:40,899
I think so too.

945
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:42,298
She's different from before.

946
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:43,018
Right, guys?

947
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:45,258
To be honest,

948
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:46,578
there are still many things

949
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:48,859
that are difficult to understand
as a teacher.

950
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,018
Just like all of you.

951
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,058
There's still a long journey
ahead of you

952
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:54,098
and many things to learn.

953
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:55,778
Miss Chen,

954
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:57,538
I have trouble too.

955
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:00,538
I really

956
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,379
despise studying.

957
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:03,979
What should I do about it?

958
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:06,179
What do you like to do?

959
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,619
I like Xiaoqi.

960
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:09,419
I like his music,

961
00:33:09,818 --> 00:33:10,498
watching his variety show,

962
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,538
and everything about him.

963
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:14,298
In that case, you're suitable to work

964
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:16,979
in the entertainment industry
in the future.

965
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:18,258
Let's say record companies

966
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:19,258
or film and television companies.

967
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:20,619
Then you'll have a lot of opportunities

968
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:21,859
to meet your idols.

969
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:22,419
Am I right?

970
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:25,379
But how do I join these companies?

971
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:27,818
You still need

972
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,058
to enter a good university

973
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:31,219
because employers require

974
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:32,298
employees to have diplomas.

975
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:33,538
If you graduate from a university,

976
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:34,619
you can apply for an interview

977
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:35,298
with those companies.

978
00:33:36,338 --> 00:33:36,778
So

979
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:37,778
your priority

980
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:39,419
is to study hard.

981
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:41,139
If you can't stand studying,

982
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:41,699
just imagine

983
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:43,859
Xiaoqi waving at you.

984
00:33:46,578 --> 00:33:47,498
For Xiaoqi,

985
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,538
I'll study hard.

986
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:50,338
But Miss Chen,

987
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:52,419
I feel sleepy

988
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:53,459
whenever I try to read.

989
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:54,538
What should I do about it, then?

990
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:56,578
You can just sleep all you want
and read after that.

991
00:33:58,939 --> 00:33:59,619
Miss Chen,

992
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,219
I don't like the major

993
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:02,699
my mom chose for me.

994
00:34:03,098 --> 00:34:03,738
What do I do?

995
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:06,498
You can just tell her

996
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:07,498
that you don't like it.

997
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,299
I think all of you

998
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:10,098
have the right

999
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:11,098
to choose your future.

1000
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:12,658
Of course,

1001
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:13,939
with the condition

1002
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,218
that you'll be responsible

1003
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:16,379
for your future.

1004
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:22,618
Miss Chen.

1005
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,419
If...

1006
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:27,578
If we meet

1007
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:28,939
someone we like,

1008
00:34:29,618 --> 00:34:30,339
what should we do?

1009
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,578
I think

1010
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:43,859
it's a precious thing

1011
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:44,939
when you like someone at 17.

1012
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:47,859
It may also be the first time

1013
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:49,379
you care about someone

1014
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:50,739
more than your friends,

1015
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:52,379
your family,

1016
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,058
and even yourself.

1017
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:55,819
So all of you

1018
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,299
must cherish these feelings.

1019
00:34:58,178 --> 00:34:58,698
But

1020
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:00,058
the road to your future

1021
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,618
is still very long.

1022
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:02,819
I suggest

1023
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:04,459
keeping your feelings

1024
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:05,498
to yourself first

1025
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,859
until you've become
a better version of yourself.

1026
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:10,618
Xu Jingjing,

1027
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:19,979
wait for me.

1028
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:20,819
I'll be a better version

1029
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:21,618
of myself!

1030
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:22,899
Dapeng,

1031
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:23,979
were you even listening?

1032
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:25,379
Miss Chen said

1033
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:27,058
to keep it to yourself.

1034
00:35:27,218 --> 00:35:27,578
That's right.

1035
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,098
Enough talking. Let's eat.

1036
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:30,459
Go and grab some more
if it's not enough.

1037
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:31,859
Don't be shy.

1038
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:36,698
Mutton fresh from the pot.

1039
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:37,859
This is good.

1040
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:38,819
It's tasty.

1041
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:40,538
Master Kang,

1042
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:41,739
I want to ask you something.

1043
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:43,058
What is it?

1044
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:46,058
You seemed to enjoy your meal today.

1045
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,058
I have to.

1046
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:51,459
How can I eat less
when it's Miss Chen's treat?

1047
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:52,739
Do you usually eat that much?

1048
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:56,379
What's wrong?

1049
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:58,218
Nothing.

1050
00:35:58,498 --> 00:35:59,058
I was just curious

1051
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:00,058
how you lost all that weight.

1052
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:02,538
Someone told me

1053
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:05,138
I must not cut my food intake
to lose weight healthily.

1054
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,339
The key is how a person eats.

1055
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,339
So tell me how.

1056
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:12,098
Eat three meals a day like always.

1057
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,178
Avoid high fat and high sugar food.

1058
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,819
At least two portions of vegetables,

1059
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:17,939
one portion of protein,

1060
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,419
and one portion of carbohydrates a day.

1061
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:20,419
Consume less than 2,000 calories a day.

1062
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:22,259
Did I miss anything?

1063
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:25,178
What about exercise?

1064
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:27,618
So is it aerobic exercise
or anaerobic exercise daily?

1065
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,218
What kind of exercises
and how many sets?

1066
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:30,299
Why?

1067
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:31,859
Are you doubting me?

1068
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:34,419
I'm worried you're taking
weight loss supplements.

1069
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:35,538
It's very harmful to your body.

1070
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:36,098
Do you know that?

1071
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:38,178
First of all,

1072
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,899
I don't take weight loss supplements.

1073
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:40,739
Secondly,

1074
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,899
our alliance has been dissolved.

1075
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:44,698
You should mind your own business

1076
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,578
while I stay handsome.

1077
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:47,178
Okay?

1078
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:19,180
(My Super Youth)

1079
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:34,498
Detective Conan,

1080
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:36,339
can you do me a favor?

1081
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:38,618
What is it?

1082
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:40,979
Can you help me

1083
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,138
investigate a person?

1084
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:44,779
Who?

1085
00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:45,739
Master Kang.

1086
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:51,618
Why?

1087
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:52,899
Is there something wrong with him?

1088
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:55,178
I'm just curious

1089
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:56,339
how he lost all his weight.

1090
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:00,739
What makes you feel suspicious?

1091
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:01,658
You see.

1092
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,698
He doesn't fast or exercise.

1093
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:04,618
So how do you think

1094
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:05,259
he loses all that weight?

1095
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:06,098
Any proof?

1096
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,178
I have no proof.

1097
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:08,819
That's why I'm asking you

1098
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:09,779
to help me investigate.

1099
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:11,538
So everything you said

1100
00:38:11,618 --> 00:38:12,538
was based on your intuition?

1101
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,018
You can say so.

1102
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:16,459
But you can't file a case

1103
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:17,218
based on intuition.

1104
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:18,698
What if he's taking
weight loss supplements?

1105
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:19,979
What if he's taking

1106
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:20,939
shoddy weight loss supplements?

1107
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:21,859
What if that shoddy weight loss...

1108
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:22,859
Come to me

1109
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:23,379
after you have proof.

1110
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:27,819
Gao Zhan,

1111
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,658
are you free next Saturday?

1112
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,218
Why?

1113
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,178
My cousin has

1114
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,739
a Taekwondo tournament next month.

1115
00:38:37,058 --> 00:38:38,138
Can you train him?

1116
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:39,739
Why didn't you ask Xu Jingjing?

1117
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:40,618
She's better than me.

1118
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:41,819
Because

1119
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:44,859
it's more convenient

1120
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:45,779
between guys.

1121
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,018
Okay, I'll see you this Saturday.

1122
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:58,899
First level alert.

1123
00:38:58,939 --> 00:38:59,339
Wake up.

1124
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:01,899
What's your problem?

1125
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:02,939
We have big trouble.

1126
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:05,339
I'm all ears.

1127
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:07,138
This Saturday,

1128
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:08,698
Xu Jingjing asked Gao Zhan

1129
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:09,339
to meet alone.

1130
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:12,779
Be specific.

1131
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,098
This Saturday,

1132
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:16,658
Xu Jingjing asked Gao Zhan

1133
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:17,498
to train

1134
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:18,739
her cousin in Taekwondo at the park.

1135
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:20,538
What's wrong with that?

1136
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:22,218
The problem is Xu Jingjing

1137
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:24,899
doesn't have a cousin at all.

1138
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:26,299
Are you sure?

1139
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:26,939
Yes.

1140
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:27,979
I grew up with her

1141
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:28,578
since I was four.

1142
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:29,498
I bet if she has a cousin,

1143
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:30,459
you'll be my dad.

1144
00:39:31,178 --> 00:39:32,018
That's generous of you.

1145
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:33,419
Be serious.

1146
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:37,698
Are you saying it's cover?

1147
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:39,498
I think

1148
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:41,259
Xu Jingjing wants to trick Gao Zhan

1149
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:41,819
to see her.

1150
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:44,339
That's bad.

1151
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:46,538
What?

1152
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:47,498
Have you forgotten

1153
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:48,739
what Xu Jingjing said

1154
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:50,218
when Miss Chen bought us
a meal last night?

1155
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:52,658
If we meet

1156
00:39:52,698 --> 00:39:54,058
someone we like,

1157
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:55,419
what should we do?

1158
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,178
Are you saying Xu Jingjing is...

1159
00:40:00,218 --> 00:40:00,618
I object.

1160
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:01,339
Me too.

1161
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:02,578
Think of something.

1162
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:03,899
There's nothing I can do.

1163
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:07,058
Have you given up on investigating

1164
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:07,939
Kang Jiawei's weight loss?

1165
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:10,138
I have no time for him.

1166
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:12,739
Calm down.

1167
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:13,698
I have an idea.

1168
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:15,698
Master Lu, please speak.

1169
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:18,979
Your hairstyle won't do.

1170
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,098
You need to fix it.

1171
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,098
Buy two fake hair wigs

1172
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,178
and clip them on your hair.

1173
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:26,379
You'll look like a young girl
in an instant.

1174
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:00,058
Kang Jiawei!

1175
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:03,899
You scared me to death.

1176
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:04,698
What are you doing here?

1177
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:07,379
I'm here to mess things up like you.
